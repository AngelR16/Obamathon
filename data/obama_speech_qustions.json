[{"question": "The problem is that this kind of vilification and over-the-top rhetoric closes the door to the possibility of compromise.  It undermines democratic deliberation.  It prevents learning -- since, after all, why should we listen to a fascist, or a socialist, or a right-wing nut, or a left-wing nut?", "filename": "01 May 2010  Commencement Speech at Michigan University.txt"}, {"question": "I want to thank everyone who participated in our meetings -- more than 50 leaders from every region of the world and key international organizations.  As at our previous summits, we didnt just come here to talk, but we came here to act.  I know that the very technical nature of nuclear security doesnt always make for flashy headlines.  But over the past six years, we have made significant, meaningful progress in securing the worlds nuclear material so that it never falls into the hands of terrorists.  And I want to take a few moments to step back and lay out exactly what we have accomplished. Together, we have removed the worlds most deadly materials from nuclear facilities around the world.  With Japans announcement today, weve now removed or secured all the highly enriched uranium and plutonium from more than 50 facilities in 30 countries -- more than 3.8 tons, which is more than enough to create 150 nuclear weapons.  That's material than will never fall into the hands of terrorists. Fourteen nations and Taiwan -- countries as diverse as Argentina and Chile, to Libya and Turkey, to Serbia and Vietnam  -- have now rid themselves entirely of highly enriched uranium and plutonium.  In particular, I want to point out again that successfully removing all of Ukraines highly enriched uranium four years ago meant that the very difficult situation in Ukraine over the past two years was not made even more dangerous by the presence of these materials. As of today, South America -- an entire continent -- is completely free of these dangerous materials.  When Poland completes its removal this year, central Europe will be free of them as well.  When Indonesia completes its work this year, so will all of Southeast Asia.  In other words, as terrorists and criminal gangs and arms merchants look around for deadly ingredients for a nuclear device, vast regions of the world are now off-limits.  And that is a remarkable achievement. Weve made important progress in the United States as well. In addition to the new steps I announced this morning, weve improved nuclear security and training.  Weve consolidated nuclear materials at fewer facilities, eliminated some 138 tons of our surplus highly enriched uranium -- which would be enough for 5,500 nuclear weapons.  Working with Russia, were on track to eliminate enough Russian highly enriched uranium for about 20,000 nuclear weapons, which we are converting to electricity here in the United States. More specifically, as a result of these summits, every single one of the more than 50 nations represented here have taken concrete steps to enhance security at their nuclear facilities and storage sites.  And that includes improved physical security, stronger regulations, abiding by international guidelines, greater transparency, and that includes international peer reviews.  Fifteen new centers have been created around the world to promote nuclear security technologies and training, to share best practices.  And as part of our work today, we agreed to keep strengthening our nuclear facilities defenses against cyber-attacks. Weve bolstered international efforts to disrupt nuclear smuggling.  The Proliferation Security Initiative has grown to more than 100 nations, including regular exercises to improve our collective ability to interdict shipments.  The United States and 36 partner countries have worked to install radiation detection equipment at more than 300 international border crossings, airports and ports.  And we are developing new mobile detection systems as well.  And finally, as I noted this morning, weve strengthened the treaties and international partnerships that are a foundation for so many of our efforts. So, again, we have made significant progress.  And everyone involved in this work -- especially our teams, who have worked tirelessly for years -- can take enormous pride in our achievements.  Nevertheless, as I said earlier, our work is by no means finished.  Theres still a great deal of nuclear and radioactive material around the world that needs to be secured.  Global stocks of plutonium are growing.  Nuclear arsenals are expanding in some countries with more small, tactical nuclear weapons, which could be at greater risk of theft.  And as a consequence, one of the central goals of this summit was how do we build on the work that has been done so that we have an international architecture that can continue the efforts, even though this is the last formal leaders summit. So even as this is the last of those leader-level summits, today we agreed to maintain a strong architecture, including through the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and INTERPOL, to carry on this work and to provide the resources and technical support that is needed to continue this mission.  And we are creating a new nuclear security contact group -- senior-level experts from more than 30 of our countries -- who will meet regularly to preserve the networks of cooperation weve built, to institutionalize this work, and to keep driving progress for years to come. At our session on ISIL this afternoon, there was widespread agreement that defeating terrorist groups like ISIL requires more information-sharing.  Everybody understands the urgency in the wake of whats happened in Brussels and Turkey, Pakistan, and so many other countries around the world.  As a consequence, our Director of National Intelligence, Jim Clapper, is continuing to engage with intelligence leaders from a number of our European partners on deepening our cooperation.  And today, I invited all the nations represented at this summit to join a broader discussion among our intelligence and security services on how we can improve information-sharing within and among our nations to prevent all manner of terrorist attacks, especially those that might involve weapons of mass destruction. In closing, I just want to say that preventing nuclear terrorism is one part of the broader agenda that I outlined seven years ago in Prague -- stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and seeking a world without them.  In recent days, theres been no shortage of analysis on whether weve achieved our vision, and Im the first to acknowledge the great deal of work that remains -- from negotiating further reductions with Russia to dealing with North Koreas nuclear program. As I indicated in Prague, realizing our vision will not happen quickly, and it perhaps will not happen in my lifetime.  But weve begun.  The United States and Russian nuclear arsenals are on track to be the lowest that they have been in six decades. Ive reduced the number and role of nuclear weapons in our nuclear security strategy.  In a historic deal, weve prevented the spread of nuclear weapons to Iran.  An international fuel bank is being built to promote civil nuclear cooperation. So Im extremely proud of our record across the board.  And were going to keep pushing forward wherever we can, as I hope future administrations do, to bring us closer to the day when these nuclear dangers no longer hang over the heads of our children and our grandchildren. With that, let me take a few questions.  And Im going to start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters. Question:  Thank you.  I want to ask about Iran.  And three weeks ago, Irans Supreme Leader complained that his country has not been getting actual business deals since the nuclear agreement.  And non-U.S. companies are saying that its very hard, or sometimes impossible, to do much business with Iran without at some point accessing the U.S. financial system to do U.S.-dollar-denominated transactions.  So my question is, are you considering allowing such transactions?  And if so, is that not a betrayal of your assurances that most U.S. sanctions would stay in place? President Obama:  Thats not actually the approach that were taking.  So let me say broadly that so long as Iran is carrying out its end of the bargain, we think its important for the world community to carry out our end of the bargain. They have, in fact, based on the presentations that were made by the IAEA this morning to the P5+1, have, in fact, followed the implementation steps that were laid out.  And as a consequence, sanctions related to their nuclear program have been brought down.  Part of the challenge that they face is that companies havent been doing business there for a long time, and they need to get comfortable with the prospects of this deal holding. One of the things that Secretary Lew and his counterparts within the P5+1 and elsewhere are going to be doing is providing clarity to businesses about what transactions are, in fact, allowed.  And its going to take time over the next several months for companies and their legal departments to feel confident that, in fact, there may not be risks of liability if they do business with Iran. And so some of the concerns that Iran has expressed we are going to work with them to address.  It is not necessary that we take the approach of them going through dollar-denominated transactions.  It is possible for them to work through European financial institutions, as well.  But there is going to need to be continued clarification provided to businesses in order to -- for deal flows to begin. Now, what I would say is also important is Irans own behavior in generating confidence that Iran is a safe place to do business.  In a deal like this, my first priority, my first concern was making sure that we got their nuclear program stopped, and material that they already had that would give them a very short breakout capacity, that that was shipped out.  That has happened.  And I always said that I could not promise that Iran would take advantage of this opportunity and this window to reenter the international community. Iran, so far, has followed the letter of the agreement.  But the spirit of the agreement involves Iran also sending signals to the world community and businesses that it is not going to be engaging in a range of provocative actions that might scare business off.  When they launched ballistic missiles with slogans calling for the destruction of Israel that makes businesses nervous.  There is some geopolitical risk that is heightened when they see that taking place. If Iran continues to ship missiles to Hezbollah, that gets businesses nervous.  And so part of what I hope happens is we have a responsibility to provide clarity about the rules that govern so that Iran can, in fact, benefit, the Iranian people can benefit from an improved economic situation.  But Iran has to understand what every country in the world understands, which is businesses want to go where they feel safe, where they don't see massive controversy, where they can be confident that transactions are going to operate normally.  And that's an adjustment that Iran is going to have to make as well. And, frankly, within Iran, I suspect there are different views.  In the same way that there are hardliners here in the United States who, even after we certify that this deal is working, even after our intelligence teams, Israeli intelligence teams say this has been a game-changer, are still opposed to the deal on principle, there are hardliners inside of Iran who don't want to see Iran open itself up to the broader world community and are doing things to potentially undermine the deal. And so those forces that seek the benefits of the deal not just in narrow terms but more broadly, we want to make sure that, over time, they're in a position to realize those benefits. David Nakamura. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  As you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks, you just finished a working session with 50 world leaders about combatting terrorism and groups like the Islamic State.  And I wanted to ask you specifically about one of the strategies, prime strategies your administration is using in that effort.  In the past several weeks, your administration has killed well over 200 people in airstrikes in Somalia, Libya, and Yemen, according to the Department of Defense.  How can you be certain that all the people killed posed an imminent threat to the United States?  And why is the United States now killing scores of people at a time, rather than eliminating individuals in very targeted strikes?  Thank you. President Obama:  We have constructed a fairly rigid and vigorous set of criteria for us evaluating the intelligence that we receive about ISIL, where it might be operating, where al Qaeda is operating.  These guidelines involve a whole range of agencies consulting extensively, and are then checked, double-checked, triple-checked before kinetic actions are taken. And for the most part, our actions are directed at high-value targets in the countries that you just described, outside of the theater of Iraq and Syria.  In some cases, what we're seeing are camps that after long periods of monitoring becomes clear are involved in in directing plots that could do the United States harm, or are supporting ISIL activities or al Qaeda activities elsewhere in the world. So, if after a long period of observation, we are seeing that, in fact, explosive materials are being loaded onto trucks, and individuals are engaging in training in small arms, and there are some of those individuals who are identified as couriers for ISIL or al Qaeda then, based on those evaluations, a strike will be taken.  But what we have been very cautious about is making sure that we are not taking strikes in situations where, for example, we think there is the presence of women or children, or if it is in a normally populated area. And recently we laid out the criteria by which we're making these decisions.  We declassified many elements of this.  We are going to be putting forward and trying to institutionalize on a regular basis how we make these evaluations and these analyses. I think, in terms of the broader debate that's taking place, David, I think theres been in the past legitimate criticism that the architecture, the legal architecture around the use of drone strikes or other kinetic strikes wasn't as precise as it should have been, and there's no doubt that civilians were killed that shouldn't have been.  I think that over the last several years, we have worked very hard to avoid and prevent those kinds of tragedies from taking place. In situations of war, we have to take responsibility when we're not acting appropriately, or where we've just made mistakes even with the best of intentions.  And that's what we're going to continue to try to do.  And what I can say with great confidence is that our operating procedures are as rigorous as they have ever been and that there is a constant evaluation of precisely what we do. Carol Lee. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You've spent seven years now working on nonproliferation issues, and you said in your opening remarks that you hope that future administrations do the same and make it a priority.  This week, the Republican frontrunner to replace you said that perhaps South Korea and Japan should have nuclear weapons, and wouldn't rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe.  Did that come up at this summit?  And just generally, what message does it send when a major-party candidate is articulating such a reversal in U.S. foreign policy?  And also, who did you vote for in the Democratic primary? President Obama:  Well, first of all, it's a secret ballot, isn't it, Carol?Okay. No, I'm not going to tell you now. What do the statements you mentioned tell us?  They tell us that the person who made the statements doesn't know much about foreign policy, or nuclear policy, or the Korean Peninsula, or the world generally. It came up on the sidelines.  Ive said before that people pay attention to American elections.  What we do is really important to the rest of the world.  And even in those countries that are used to a carnival atmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to U.S. elections because they understand the President of the United States needs to know whats going on around the world and has to put in place the kinds of policies that lead not only to our security and prosperity, but will have an impact on everybody elses security and prosperity. Our alliance with Japan and the Republic of Korea is one of the foundations, one of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia Pacific region.  It has underwritten the peace and prosperity of that region.  It has been an enormous buoy to American commerce and America influence.  And it has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation and conflict between countries that, in the past and throughout history, have been engaged in hugely destructive conflicts and controversies. So you don't mess with that.  It is an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made back in World War II when they were fighting throughout the Pacific.  It is because of their sacrifices and the wisdom that American foreign policymakers showed after World War II that weve been able to avoid catastrophe in those regions.  And we don't want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn't recognize how important that is. Andrew Beatty. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Yesterday you met with President Erdogan of Turkey hours after some fairly ugly scenes at the Brookings Institution.  I was wondering, do you consider him an authoritarian? President Obama:  Turkey is a NATO ally.  It is an extraordinarily important partner in our fight against ISIL.  It is a country with whom we have a long and strategic relationship with.  And President Erdogan is someone who Ive dealt with since I came into office, and in a whole range of areas, weve had a productive partnership. What is also true, and I have expressed this to him directly, so its no secret that there are some trends within Turkey that Ive been troubled with.  I am a strong believer in freedom of the press.  I'm a strong believer in freedom of religion.  I'm a strong believer in rule of law and democracy.  And there is no doubt that President Erdogan has repeatedly been elected through a democratic process, but I think the approach that they've been taking towards the press is one that could lead Turkey down a path that would be very troubling. And we are going to continue to advise them -- and I've said to President Erdogan, remind him that he came into office with a promise of democracy.  And Turkey has historically been a country in which deep Islamic faith has lived side by side with modernity and an increasing openness.  And that's the legacy that he should pursue, rather than a strategy that involves repression of information and shutting down democratic debate. Having said that, I want to emphasize the degree to which their cooperation has been critical on a whole range of international and regional issues, and will continue to be.  And so as is true with a lot of our friends and partners, we work with them, we cooperate with them.  We are appreciative of their efforts.  And there are going to be some differences.  And where there are differences, we will say so.  And that's what I've tried to do here. I'll take one last question.  This young lady right there. Question:   Thank you, President.  Mr. President, what do you think -- President Obama:  Where are you from, by the way? Question:   I am from Azerbaijan.  How can Azerbaijan support in nuclear security issue? President Obama:  Well, Azerbaijan, like many countries that participated, have already taken a number of steps.  And each country has put forward a national action plan.  There are some countries that had stockpiles of highly enriched uranium that they agreed to get rid of.  There are other countries that have civilian nuclear facilities but dont necessarily have the best security practices, and so they have adopted better security practices. There are countries that could potentially be transit points for the smuggling of nuclear materials, and so they've worked with us on border controls and detection.  And because of Azerbaijan's location, it's a critical partner in this process. I should point out, by the way, that although the focus of these summits has been on securing nuclear materials and making sure they dont fall into the hands of terrorists, the relationships, the information-sharing, the stitching together of domestic law enforcement, international law enforcement, intelligence, military agencies, both within countries and between countries -- this set of relationships internationally will be useful not just for nuclear material, but it is useful in preventing terrorism generally.  It's useful in identifying threats of chemical weapons or biological weapons. One of the clear messages coming out of this summit and our experiences over the last seven years is an increasing awareness that some of the most important threats that we face are transnational threats.  And so we are slowly developing a web of relationships around the world that allow us to match and keep up with the transnational organizations that all too often are involved in terrorist activity, criminal activity, human trafficking, a whole range of issues that can ultimately do our citizens harms.  And seeing the strengthening of these institutions I think will be one of the most important legacies of this entire process. Mark Landler, since you had your hand up, Ill call on you.  One last question. Question:   Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask a question about nuclear policy.  Through these past seven years when you've pushed to rid the world of nuclear materials and fissile material, the U.S. nuclear industry has actually worked to improve miniaturization of warheads.  And while it has not developed new classes of cruise missiles or warheads, its worked to improve the technology.  And that's prompted some in China and Russia to say, well, gee, we need to keep up.  Are you concerned that the technological advances in the United States have had the effect of sort of undermining some of the progress you've made on the prevention side?", "filename": "01April2016NuclearSecuritySummitPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Senator, much of what you see is from  helicopters. So you look out, with the buzz of the rotor in your ear, maybe a door gunner nearby, and you see the refugee camps in Darfur, the blood near Djibouti -- the...flood near Djibouti, the bombed out blocks in Baghdad. You see the thousands of desperate faces. But you only see them from a distance. Al Qaeda's new recruits come from Africa and Asia, the Middle East and Europe. Many come from disaffected communities and disconnected corners of our interconnected world. And it makes you stop and wonder: When those faces look up at an American helicopter, do they feel hope, or do they feel hate?", "filename": "01August2007WoodrowWilsonCenterSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Major General Paul Eaton had a long and distinguished career serving this country. It included training the Iraqi Army. After Abu Ghraib, his senior Iraqi advisor came into his office and said: \"You have no idea how will this play -- this will play out in the streets of Baghdad and the rest of the Arab world. How can this be?", "filename": "01August2007WoodrowWilsonCenterSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "This morning, we learned that our economy created over 200,000 new jobs in July.  Thats on top of about 300,000 new jobs in June.  So we are now in a six-month streak with at least 200,000 new jobs each month.  That's the first time that has happened since 1997.  Over the past year, weve added more jobs than any year since 2006.  And all told, our businesses have created 9.9 million new jobs over the past 53 months.  That's the longest streak of private sector job creation in our history.  And as we saw on Wednesday, the economy grew at a strong pace in the spring.  Companies are investing.  Consumers are spending.  American manufacturing, energy, technology, autos -- all are booming.  And thanks to the decisions that weve made, and the grit and resilience of the American people, weve recovered faster and come farther from the recession than almost any other advanced country on Earth.  So the good news is the economy clearly is getting stronger. Things are getting better.  Our engines are revving a little bit louder.  And the decisions that we make right now can sustain and keep that growth and momentum going. Unfortunately, there are a series of steps that we could be taking to maintain momentum, and perhaps even accelerate it; there are steps that we could be taking that would result in more job growth, higher wages, higher incomes, more relief for middle-class families.  And so far, at least, in Congress, we have not seen them willing or able to take those steps. I've been pushing for common-sense ideas like rebuilding our infrastructure in ways that are sustained over many years and support millions of good jobs and help businesses compete.  I've been advocating on behalf of raising the minimum wage, making it easier for working folks to pay off their student loans; fair pay, paid leave.  All these policies have two things in common:  All of them would help working families feel more stable and secure, and all of them so far have been blocked or ignored by Republicans in Congress.  Thats why my administration keeps taking whatever actions we can take on our own to help working families.  Now, its good that Congress was able to pass legislation to strengthen the VA.  And I want to thank the chairmen and ranking members who were involved in that.  It's good that Congress was able to at least fund transportation projects for a few more months before leaving town -- although it falls far short of the kind of infrastructure effort that we need that would actually accelerate the economy.  But for the most part, the big-ticket items, the things that would really make a difference in the lives of middle-class families, those things just are not getting done.  Lets just take a recent example:  Immigration.  We all agree that theres a problem that needs to be solved in a portion of our southern border.  And we even agree on most of the solutions.  But instead of working together -- instead of focusing on the 80 percent where there is agreement between Democrats and Republicans, between the administration and Congress -- House Republicans, as we speak, are trying to pass the most extreme and unworkable versions of a bill that they already know is going nowhere, that can't pass the Senate and that if it were to pass the Senate I would veto.  They know it.  Theyre not even trying to actually solve the problem.  This is a message bill that they couldn't quite pull off yesterday, so they made it a little more extreme so maybe they can pass it today -- just so they can check a box before theyre leaving town for a month.  And this is on an issue that they all insisted had to be a top priority.    Now, our efforts administratively so far have helped to slow the tide of child migrants trying to come to our country.  But without additional resources and help from Congress, we're just not going to have the resources we need to fully solve the problem.  That means while theyre out on vacation I'm going to have to make some tough choices to meet the challenge -- with or without Congress.  And yesterday, even though theyve been sitting on a bipartisan immigration bill for over a year, House Republicans suggested that since they don't expect to actually pass a bill that I can sign, that I actually should go ahead and act on my own to solve the problem.  Keep in mind that just a few days earlier, they voted to sue me for acting on my own.  And then when they couldnt pass a bill yesterday, they put out a statement suggesting I should act on my own because they couldn't pass a bill. So immigration has not gotten done.  A student loan bill that would help folks who have student loan debt consolidate and refinance at lower rates -- that didnt pass.  The transportation bill that they did pass just gets us through the spring, when we should actually be planning years in advance.  States and businesses are raising the minimum wage for their workers because this Congress is failing to do so.  Even basic things like approving career diplomats for critical ambassadorial posts aren't getting done.  Last night, for purely political reasons, Senate Republicans, for a certain period of time, blocked our new ambassador to Russia.  It raised such an uproar that finally they went ahead and let our Russian ambassador pass -- at a time when we are dealing every day with the crisis in Ukraine. Theyre still blocking our ambassador to Sierra Leone, where theres currently an Ebola outbreak.  Theyre blocking our ambassador to Guatemala, even as they demand that we do more to stop the flow of unaccompanied children from Guatemala.  There are a lot of things that we could be arguing about on policy -- that's what we should be doing as a democracy -- but we shouldnt be having an argument about placing career diplomats with bipartisan support in countries around the world where we have to have a presence. So the bottom line is this:  We have come a long way over the last five and a half years.  Our challenges are nowhere near as daunting as they were when I first came into office.  But the American people demand and deserve a strong and focused effort on the part of all of us to keep moving the country forward and to focus on their concerns.  And the fact is we could be much further along and we could be doing even better, and the economy could be even stronger, and more jobs could be created if Congress would do the job that the people sent them here to do. And I will not stop trying to work with both parties to get things moving faster for middle-class families and those trying to get into the middle class.  When Congress returns next month, my hope is, is that instead of simply trying to pass partisan message bills on party lines that don't actually solve problems, theyre going to be willing to come together to at least focus on some key areas where theres broad agreement.  After all that we've had to overcome, our Congress should stop standing in the way of our countrys success.   So with that, let me take a couple of questions.  And I will start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters. Question:  Thanks.  I want to ask about the situation in the Middle East.  And why do you think Israel should embrace a cease-fire in Gaza when one of its soldiers appears to have been abducted and when Hamas continues to use its network of tunnels to launch attacks?  And also, have you seen Israel act at all on your call to do more to protect civilians? President Obama:  Well, first of all, I think it's important to note that we have -- and I have -- unequivocally condemned Hamas and the Palestinian factions that were responsible for killing two Israeli soldiers and abducting a third almost minutes after a cease-fire had been announced.  And the U.N. has condemned them as well. And I want to make sure that they are listening:  If they are serious about trying to resolve this situation, that soldier needs to be unconditionally released as soon as possible.  I have been very clear throughout this crisis that Israel has a right to defend itself.  No country can tolerate missiles raining down on its cities and people having to rush to bomb shelters every 20 minutes or half hour.  No country can or would tolerate tunnels being dug under their land that can be used to launch terrorist attacks. And so, not only have we been supportive of Israel in its right to defend itself, but in very concrete terms -- for example, in support for the Iron Dome program that has intercepted rockets that are firing down on Israeli cities -- we've been trying to cooperate as much as we can to make sure that Israel is able to protect its citizens. Now, at the same time, we've also been clear that innocent civilians in Gaza caught in the crossfire have to weigh on our conscience and we have to do more to protect them.  A cease-fire was one way in which we could stop the killing, to step back and to try to resolve some of the underlying issues that have been building up over quite some time.  Israel committed to that 72-hour cease-fire, and it was violated.  And trying to put that back together is going to be challenging, but we will continue to make those efforts. And let me take this opportunity, by the way, to give Secretary John Kerry credit.  He has been persistent.  He has worked very hard.  He has endured on many occasions really unfair criticism simply to try to get to the point where the killing stops and the underlying issues about Israels security but also the concerns of Palestinians in Gaza can be addressed. We're going to keep working towards that.  It's going to take some time.  I think it's going to be very hard to put a cease-fire back together again if Israelis and the international community can't feel confident that Hamas can follow through on a cease-fire commitment. And it's not particularly relevant whether a particular leader in Hamas ordered this abduction.  The point is, is that when they sign onto a cease-fire theyre claiming to speak for all the Palestinian factions.  And if they don't have control of them, and just moments after a cease-fire is signed you have Israeli soldiers being killed and captured, then it's hard for the Israelis to feel confident that a cease-fire can actually be honored. I'm in constant consultation with Prime Minister Netanyahu. Our national security team is in constant communication with the Israel military.  I want to see everything possible done to make sure that Palestinian civilians are not being killed.  And it is heartbreaking to see whats happening there, and I think many of us recognize the dilemma we have.  On the one hand, Israel has a right to defend itself and it's got to be able to get at those rockets and those tunnel networks.  On the other hand, because of the incredibly irresponsible actions on the part of Hamas to oftentimes house these rocket launchers right in the middle of civilian neighborhoods, we end up seeing people who had nothing to do with these rockets ending up being hurt. Part of the reason why we've been pushing so hard for a cease-fire is precisely because it's hard to reconcile Israels legitimate need to defend itself with our concern with those civilians.  And if we can pause the fighting, then it's possible that we may be able to arrive at a formula that spares lives and also ensures Israels security.  But it's difficult.  And I don't think we should pretend otherwise. Bill Plante. Question:  Mr. President, like that cease-fire, youve called for diplomatic solutions not only in Israel and Gaza but also in Ukraine, in Iraq, to very little effect so far.  Has the United States of America lost its influence in the world?  Have you lost yours? President Obama:  Look, this is a common theme that folks bring up.  Apparently people have forgotten that America, as the most powerful country on Earth, still does not control everything around the world.  And so our diplomatic efforts often take time. They often will see progress and then a step backwards.  Thats been true in the Middle East.  Thats been true in Europe.  Thats been true in Asia.  Thats the nature of world affairs.  Its not neat, and its not smooth. But if you look at, for example, Ukraine, we have made progress in delivering on what we said we would do.  We cant control how Mr. Putin thinks.  But what we can do is say to Mr. Putin, if you continue on the path of arming separatists with heavy armaments that the evidence suggests may have resulted in 300 innocent people on a jet dying, and that violates international law and undermines the integrity -- territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine, then youre going to face consequences that will hurt your country. And there was a lot of skepticism about our ability to coordinate with Europeans for a strong series of sanctions.  And each time we have done what we said we would do, including this week, when we put in place sanctions that have an impact on key sectors of the Russian economy -- their energy, their defense, their financial systems. It hasnt resolved the problem yet.  I spoke to Mr. Putin this morning, and I indicated to him, just as we will do what we say we do in terms of sanctions, well also do what we say we do in terms of wanting to resolve this issue diplomatically if he takes a different position.  If he respects and honors the right of Ukrainians to determine their own destiny, then its possible to make sure that Russian interests are addressed that are legitimate, and that Ukrainians are able to make their own decisions, and we can resolve this conflict and end some of the bloodshed. But the point is, though, Bill, that if you look at the 20th century and the early part of this century, there are a lot of conflicts that America doesnt resolve.  Thats always been true.  That doesnt mean we stop trying.  And its not a measure of American influence on any given day or at any given moment that there are conflicts around the world that are difficult.  The conflict in Northern Ireland raged for a very, very long time until finally something broke, where the parties decided that it wasnt worth killing each other. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been going on even longer than youve been reporting.  And I dont think at any point was there a suggestion somehow that America didnt have influence just because we werent able to finalize an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.  You will recall that situations like Kosovo and Bosnia raged on for quite some time, and there was a lot more death and bloodshed than there has been so far in the Ukrainian situation before it ultimately did get resolved. And so I recognize with so many different issues popping up around the world, sometimes it may seem as if this is an aberration or its unusual.  But the truth of the matter is, is that theres a big world out there, and that as indispensable as we are to try to lead it, theres still going to be tragedies out there and there are going to be conflicts.  And our job is to just make sure that we continue to project whats right, whats just, and that were building coalitions of like-minded countries and partners in order to advance not only our core security interests but also the interests of the world as a whole. Question:  Do you think you could have done more? President Obama:  On which one? Question:  On any of them?  Ukraine? President Obama:  Well look, I think, Bill, that the nature of being President is that youre always asking yourself what more can you do.  But with respect to, lets say, the Israeli-Palestinian issue, this administration invested an enormous amount to try to bring the parties together around a framework for peace and a two-state solution.  John Kerry invested an enormous amount of time.  In the end, its up to the two parties to make a decision.  We can lead them to resolve some of the technical issues and to show them a path, but theyve got to want it.  With respect to Ukraine, I think that we have done everything that we can to support the Ukrainian government and to deter Russia from moving further into Ukraine.  But short of going to war, there are going to be some constraints in terms of what we can do if President Putin and Russia are ignoring what should be their long-term interests.  Right now, what weve done is impose sufficient costs on Russia that, objectively speaking, they should -- President Putin should want to resolve this diplomatically, get these sanctions lifted, get their economy growing again, and have good relations with Ukraine.  But sometimes people dont always act rationally, and they dont always act based on their medium- or long-term interests.  That cant deter us, though.  Weve just got to stay at it.  Wendell. Question:  Mr. President, Republicans point to some of your executive orders as reason, they say, that they cant trust you to implement legislation that they pass.  Even if you dont buy that argument, do you hold yourself totally blameless in the inability it appears to reach agreement with the Republican-led House? President Obama:  Wendell, lets just take the recent example of immigration.  A bipartisan bill passed out of the Senate, co-sponsored by not just Democrats but some very conservative Republicans who recognize that the system currently is broken and if, in fact we put more resources on the border, provide a path in which those undocumented workers whove been living here for a long time and may have ties here are coming out of the shadows, paying their taxes, paying a fine, learning English -- if we fix the legal immigration system so its more efficient, if we are attracting young people who may have studied here to stay here and create jobs here, that that all is going to be good for the economy, its going to reduce the deficit, it might have forestalled some of the problems that were seeing now in the Rio Grande Valley with these unaccompanied children. And so we have a bipartisan bill, Wendell, bipartisan agreement supported by everybody from labor to the evangelical community to law enforcement.  So the argument isnt between me and the House Republicans.  Its between the House Republicans and Senate Republicans, and House Republicans and the business community, and House Republicans and the evangelical community.  Im just one of the people they seem to disagree with on this issue. So thats on the comprehensive bill.  So now we have a short-term crisis with respect to the Rio Grande Valley.  They say we need more resources, we need tougher border security in this area where these unaccompanied children are showing up.  We agree.  So we put forward a supplemental to give us the additional resources and funding to do exactly what they say we should be doing, and they cant pass the bill.  They cant even pass their own version of the bill.  So thats not a disagreement between me and the House Republicans; thats a disagreement between the House Republicans and the House Republicans.  The point is that on a range of these issues, whether its tax reform, whether its reducing the deficit, whether its rebuilding our infrastructure, we have consistently put forward proposals that in previous years and previous administrations would not have been considered radical or left wing; they would have been considered pretty sensible, mainstream approaches to solving problems.  I include under that, by the way, the Affordable Care Act.  Thats a whole other conversation. And in circumstances where even basic, common-sense, plain, vanilla legislation cant pass because House Republicans consider it somehow a compromise of their principles, or giving Obama a victory, then weve got to take action.  Otherwise, were not going to be making progress on the things that the American people care about. Question:  On the border supplemental -- can you act alone? President Obama:  Well, Im going to have to act alone because we dont have enough resources.  Weve already been very clear -- weve run out of money.  And we are going to have to reallocate resources in order to just make sure that some of the basic functions that have to take place down there -- whether its making sure that these children are properly housed, or making sure weve got enough immigration judges to process their cases  -- that those things get done.  Were going to have to reallocate some resources. But the broader point, Wendell, is that if, in fact, House Republicans are concerned about me acting independently of Congress -- despite the fact that Ive taken fewer executive actions than my Republican predecessor or my Democratic predecessor before that, or the Republican predecessor before that -- then the easiest way to solve it is passing legislation. Get things done. On the supplemental, we agreed on 80 percent of the issues. There were 20 percent of the issues that perhaps there were disagreements between Democrats and Republicans.  As I said to one Republican colleague who was down here that I was briefing about some national security issues, why wouldnt we just go ahead and pass the 80 percent that we agree on and well try to work to resolve the differences on the other 20 percent?  Why wouldnt we do that?  And he didn't really have a good answer for it. So theres no doubt that I can always do better on everything, including making additional calls to Speaker Boehner, and having more conversations with some of the House Republican leadership.  But in the end, the challenge I have right now is that they are not able to act even on what they say their priorities are, and they're not able to work and compromise even with Senate Republicans on certain issues.  And they consider what have been traditionally Republican-supported initiatives, they consider those as somehow a betrayal of the cause. Take the example of the Export-Import Bank.  This is an interesting thing that's happened.  This is a program in which we help to provide financing to sell American goods and products around the world.  Every country does this.  Its traditionally been championed by Republicans.  For some reason, right now the House Republicans have decided that we shouldnt do this -- which means that when American companies go overseas and they're trying to close a sale on selling Boeing planes, for example, or a GE turbine, or some other American product, that has all kinds of subcontractors behind it and is creating all kinds of jobs, and all sorts of small businesses depend on that sale, and that American company is going up against a German company or a Chinese company, and the Chinese and the German company are providing financing and the American company isnt, we may lose that sale.  When did that become something that Republicans opposed?  It would be like me having a car dealership for Ford, and the Toyota dealership offers somebody financing and I don't.  We will lose business and well lose jobs if we dont pass it.  So theres some big issues where I understand why we have differences.  On taxes, Republicans want to maintain some corporate loopholes I think need to be closed because I think that we should be giving tax breaks to families that are struggling with child care or trying to save for a college education.  On health care, obviously their view is, is that we should not be helping folks get health care, even though its through the private marketplace.  My view is, is that in a country as wealthy as ours, we can afford to make sure that everybody has access to affordable care.  Those are legitimate policy arguments.  But getting our ambassadors confirmed?  These are career diplomats, not political types.  Making sure that we pass legislation to strengthen our borders and put more folks down there?  Those shouldnt be controversial.  And I think youd be hard-pressed to find an example of where I wouldnt welcome some reasonable efforts to actually get a bill passed out of Congress that I could sign.  Last question, Michelle Kosinski. Question:  You made the point that in certain difficult conflicts in the past, both sides had to reach a point where they were tired of the bloodshed.  Do you think that we are actually far from that point right now?  And is it realistic to try to broker a cease-fire right now when there are still tunnel operations allowed to continue?  Is that going to cause a change of approach from this point forward? President Obama:  Well, keep in mind that the cease-fire that had been agreed to would have given Israel the capability to continue to dismantle these tunnel networks, but the Israelis can dismantle these tunnel networks without going into major population centers in Gaza.  So I think the Israelis are entirely right that these tunnel networks need to be dismantled.  There is a way of doing that while still reducing the bloodshed. You are right that in past conflicts, sometimes people have to feel deeply the costs.  Anybody who has been watching some of these images Id like to think should recognize the costs.  You have children who are getting killed.  You have women, defenseless, who are getting killed.  You have Israelis whose lives are disrupted constantly and living in fear.  And those are costs that are avoidable if were able to get a cease-fire that preserves Israels ability to defend itself and gives it the capacity to have an assurance that theyre not going to be constantly threatened by rocket fire in the future, and, conversely, an agreement that recognizes the Palestinian need to be able to make a living and the average Palestinians capacity to live a decent life. But its hard.  Its going to be hard to get there.  I think that theres a lot of anger and theres a lot of despair, and thats a volatile mix.  But we have to keep trying.  And it is -- Bill asked earlier about American leadership.  Part of the reason why America remains indispensable, part of the essential ingredient in American leadership is that were willing to plunge in and try, where other countries dont bother trying.  I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that in all these crises that have been mentioned, there may be some tangential risks to the United States.  In some cases, as in Iraq and ISIS, those are dangers that have to be addressed right now, and we have to take them very seriously.  But for the most part, these are not -- the rockets arent being fired into the United States.  The reason we are concerned is because we recognize weve got some special responsibilities.  We have to have some humility about what we can and cant accomplish.  We have to recognize that our resources are finite, and were coming out of a decade of war and our military has been stretched very hard, as has our budget.  Nevertheless, we try.  We go in there and we make an effort. And when I see John Kerry going out there and trying to broker a cease-fire, we should all be supporting him.  There shouldnt be a bunch of complaints and second-guessing about, well, it hasnt happened yet, or nitpicking before hes had a chance to complete his efforts.  Because, I tell you what, there isnt any other country thats going in there and making those efforts.  And more often than not, as a consequence of our involvement, we get better outcomes -- not perfect outcomes, not immediate outcomes, but we get better outcomes.  And thats going to be true with respect to the Middle East.  Thats going to be true with respect to Ukraine.  Thats going to be certainly true with respect to Iraq. And I think its useful for me to end by just reminding folks that, in my first term, if I had a press conference like this, typically, everybody would want to ask about the economy and how come jobs werent being created, and how come the housing market is still bad, and why isnt it working.  Well, you know what, what we did worked.  And the economy is better.  And when I say that weve just had six months of more than 200,000 jobs that hasnt happened in 17 years that shows you the power of persistence.  It shows you that if you stay at it, eventually we make some progress.  All right? Question:  What about John Brennan? Question:  The Africa summit -- Ebola? President Obama:  I thought that you guys were going to ask me how I was going to spend my birthday.  What happened to the happy birthday thing? Statement:  Happy birthday. Question:  What about John Brennan? Question:  Africa summit? President Obama:  I will address two points.  Ill address -- Question:  And Flight 17? President Obama:  Hold on, guys.  Come on.  Theres just -- Question:  And Africa. President Obama:  You're not that pent up.  Ive been giving you questions lately. On Brennan and the CIA, the RDI report has been transmitted, the declassified version that will be released at the pleasure of the Senate committee.  I have full confidence in John Brennan.  I think he has acknowledged and directly apologized to Senator Feinstein that CIA personnel did not properly handle an investigation as to how certain documents that were not authorized to be released to the Senate staff got somehow into the hands of the Senate staff.  And its clear from the IG report that some very poor judgment was shown in terms of how that was handled.  Keep in mind, though, that John Brennan was the person who called for the IG report, and hes already stood up a task force to make sure that lessons are learned and mistakes are resolved. With respect to the larger point of the RDI report itself, even before I came into office I was very clear that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 we did some things that were wrong.  We did a whole lot of things that were right, but we tortured some folks.  We did some things that were contrary to our values.  I understand why it happened.  I think its important when we look back to recall how afraid people were after the Twin Towers fell and the Pentagon had been hit and the plane in Pennsylvania had fallen, and people did not know whether more attacks were imminent, and there was enormous pressure on our law enforcement and our national security teams to try to deal with this.  And its important for us not to feel too sanctimonious in retrospect about the tough job that those folks had.  And a lot of those folks were working hard under enormous pressure and are real patriots.  But having said all that, we did some things that were wrong.  And that's what that report reflects.  And that's the reason why, after I took office, one of the first things I did was to ban some of the extraordinary interrogation techniques that are the subject of that report. And my hope is, is that this report reminds us once again that the character of our country has to be measured in part not by what we do when things are easy, but what we do when things are hard.  And when we engaged in some of these enhanced interrogation techniques, techniques that I believe and I think any fair-minded person would believe were torture, we crossed a line.  And that needs to be -- that needs to be understood and accepted.  And we have to, as a country, take responsibility for that so that, hopefully, we don't do it again in the future. Question:  Mr. President -- President Obama:  Now, I gave you a question. Statement:  All right. Question:  The summit -- the U.S.-Africa -- President Obama:  Weve got a U.S.-Africa Summit coming up next week.  It is going to be an unprecedented gathering of African leaders.  The importance of this for America needs to be understood.  Africa is one of the fastest-growing continents in the world.  Youve got six of the 10 fastest-growing economies in Africa.  You have all sorts of other countries like China and Brazil and India deeply interested in working with Africa -- not to extract natural resources alone, which traditionally has been the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world -- but now because Africa is growing and youve got thriving markets and youve got entrepreneurs and extraordinary talent among the people there.  And Africa also happens to be one of the continents where America is most popular and people feel a real affinity for our way of life.  And weve made enormous progress over the last several years in not just providing traditional aid to Africa, helping countries that are suffering from malnutrition or helping countries that are suffering from AIDS, but rather partnering and thinking about how can we trade more and how can we do business together.  And thats the kind of relationship that Africa is looking for.  And Ive had conversations over the last several months with U.S. businesses -- some of the biggest U.S. businesses in the world -- and they say, Africa, thats one of our top priorities; we want to do business with those folks, and we think that we can create U.S. jobs and send U.S. exports to Africa.  But weve got to be engaged, and so this gives us a chance to do that.  It also gives us a chance to talk to Africa about security issues -- because, as weve seen, terrorist networks try to find places where governance is weak and security structures are weak.  And if we want to keep ourselves safe over the long term, then one of the things that we can do is make sure that we are partnering with some countries that really have pretty effective security forces and have been deploying themselves in peacekeeping and conflict resolution efforts in Africa.  And that, ultimately, can save us and our troops and our military a lot of money if weve got strong partners who are able to deal with conflicts in these regions.  So its going to be a terrific conference.  I wont lie to you, traffic will be bad here in Washington.  I know that everybody has been warned about that, but we are really looking forward to this and I think its going to be a great success.  Now, the last thing Im going to say about this, because I know that its been on peoples minds, is the issue of Ebola.  This is something that we take very seriously.  As soon as theres an outbreak anywhere in the world of any disease that could have significant effects, the CDC is in communication with the World Health Organization and other multilateral agencies to try to make sure that weve got an appropriate response. This has been a more aggressive Ebola outbreak than weve seen in the past.  But keep in mind that it is still affecting parts of three countries, and weve got some 50 countries represented at this summit.  We are doing two things with respect to the summit itself.  Were taking the appropriate precautions.  Folks who are coming from these countries that have even a marginal risk or an infinitesimal risk of having been exposed in some fashion, were making sure were doing screening on that end -- as they leave the country.  Well do additional screening when theyre here.  We feel confident that the procedures that weve put in place are appropriate.  More broadly, the CDC and our various health agencies are going to be working very intently with the World Health Organization and some of our partner countries to make sure that we can surge some resources down there and organization to these countries that are pretty poor and dont have a strong public health infrastructure so that we can start containing the problem. Keep in mind that Ebola is not something that is easily transmitted.  Thats why, generally, outbreaks dissipate.  But the key is identifying, quarantining, isolating those who contract it and making sure that practices are in place that avoid transmission.  And it can be done, but its got to be done in an organized, systematic way, and that means that were going to have to help these countries accomplish that.  All right?", "filename": "01August2014PresseronExecutiveActionandForeignPolicy.txt"}, {"question": "We seek an agreement that gives businesses and investors the certainty that the global economy is on a firm path towards a low-carbon future, because that will spur the kind of investment that will be vital to combine reduced emissions with economic growth. Thats the goal.  Not just an agreement to roll back the pollution that threatens our planet, but an agreement that helps our economies grow and our people to thrive without condemning the next generation to a planet that is beyond its capacity to repair. Now, all of this will be hard.  Getting 200 nations to agree on anything is hard.  And Im sure there will be moments over the next two weeks where progress seems stymied, and everyone rushes to write that we are doomed.  But Im convinced that were going to get big things done here.  Keep in mind, nobody expected that 180 countries would show up in Paris with serious climate targets in hand.  Nobody expected that the price of clean energy would fall as fast as it has, or that back in the United States, the solar industry would be creating jobs 10 times faster than the rest of the economy.  Nobody expected that more than 150 of Americas biggest companies would pledge their support to an ambitious Paris outcome -- or that a couple dozen of the worlds wealthiest private citizens would join us here to pledge to invest unprecedented resources to bring clean energy technologies to market faster. What gives me confidence that progress is possible is somebody like Bill Gates -- who I was with yesterday -- understands that tackling climate change is not just a moral imperative, it's an opportunity.  Without batting an eye, he said were just going to have to go ahead and invent some new technologies to tackle this challenge.  That kind of optimism, that kind of sense that we can do what is necessary is infectious.  And you tend to believe somebody like Bill when he says that were going to get it done -- since hes done some pretty remarkable things.  And I believe that a successful two weeks here could give the world that same kind of optimism that the future is ours to shape. So, with that, I'm going to take a few questions.  We'll start with Jerome Cartillier of [AFP].  Wheres Jerome? Question:  Good morning, sir, and thank you, Mr. President.  For months now, youve been asking Mr. Putin to play basically a more constructive role in Syria, basically shifting from defending Assad to attacking ISIL.  It appears your calls have not been heard.  Whats your strategy going forward?", "filename": "01December2015ParisPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "President.  I guess I wanted to follow on that shift in calculation that you discussed in terms of President Putin.  Did you receive assurances from either him or President Hollande -- who said earlier this week that President Putin had told him he would only target jihadis and ISIS -- that that will be the focus of Russias military campaign going forward? And then, separately, I just wanted to ask about climate.  The outstanding issue seems to be whether Republicans who have kind of voiced opposition to your agenda could somehow submarine funding for the Green Climate Fund.  Thats a pretty crucial part here.  So Im wondering both how you prevent that in the upcoming appropriations process, and if youre at all concerned about what Senator McConnell said earlier today or yesterday that a future Republican President could undo what youre trying to accomplish here in Paris. President Obama:  First of all, on Mr. Putin, I dont expect that youre going to see a 180-turn on their strategy over the next several weeks.  They have invested for years now in keeping Assad in power.  Their presence there is predicated on propping him up.  And so thats going to take some time for them to change how they think about the issue. And so long as they are aligned with the regime, a lot of Russian resources are still going to be targeted at opposition groups that ultimately are going to end up being part of an inclusive government that we support or other members of the coalition support, and are fighting the regime and fighting ISIL at the same time.  So I dont think we should be under any illusions that somehow Russia starts hitting only ISIL targets.  Thats not happening now.  It was never happening.  Its not going to be happening in the next several weeks. What can happen is if the political process that John Kerry has so meticulously stitched together -- in concert with Foreign Minister Lavrov of Russia -- if that works in Vienna, then its possible, given the existing accord that the parties have already agreed to, that we start seeing at least pockets of ceasefires in and around Syria.  That may mean then that certain opposition groups no longer find themselves subject to either Syrian or Russian bombing; they are then in a conversation about politics. And slowly, we then are able to get everybodys attention diverted to where it needs to be, and that is going after ISIL in a systematic way. With respect to climate and whats taking place here, I dont want to get ahead of ourselves -- we still need a Paris agreement.  And so my main focus is making sure that the United States is a leader in bringing a successful agreement home here in Paris.  And there are a number of components to it.  So I just want to repeat so that everybody understands what we will consider success several weeks from now. Number one, that it is an ambitious target that seeks a low-carbon global economy over the course of this century.  That means that countries have put forward specific targets, and although those are self-generating, there is a mechanism in which they are presenting to the world confirmation that they are working on those targets, meeting on those targets.  So theres a single transparency mechanism that all countries are adhering to, and that those are legally binding; that theres periodic reviews so that as the science changes and as technology changes, five years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now -- in each successive cycle, countries can update the pledges that they make; and that weve got a climate fund that helps developing countries to not only adapt and mitigate but also leapfrog over dirty-power generation in favor of clean energy. And if we hit those targets, then we will have been successful.  Not because, by the way, the pledges alone will meet the necessary targets for us to prevent catastrophic climate change, but because we will have built the architecture thats needed.  We will have established a global consensus of how were going to approach the problem.  And then we can successfully turn up the dials as new sources of energy become available, as the unit costs for something like solar or improvements in battery technology make it easier for us to meet even higher targets.  And systematically, we can drive down carbon emissions and the pace of climate change over the course of several decades. So I want to emphasize this because I know that in some of the reporting -- if you add up all the pledges and they were all met right now, we would be at a estimated 2.7 centigrade increase in temperature.  Thats too high.  We wanted to get 2 centigrade or even lower than that.  But if we have these periodic reviews built in, what I believe will happen is that by sending that signal to researchers and scientists and investors and entrepreneurs and venture funds, well actually start hitting these targets faster than we expected, and we can be even more ambitious.  And so when you look at the cumulative targets that may exist 10 years from now, we may well be within the 2 percent centigrade increase. And by the way, thats not just foolish optimism.  When you look at the experience of the United States, for example -- I came into office, I prioritized clean energy, I said were going to double our clean energy production.  Through the Recovery Act, we recognized that making these big investments were also good for the economy and helping us get out of recession and could create jobs.  So we made a big investment, and it turned out that we met our goals a lot quicker than we expected. If you had asked me when I first came into office my expectations for the price of solar-generated power versus traditional coal or other fossil-fuel-generated power, I would say we would make some progress but that solar would still require substantial subsidies in order to be economical.  The cost of solar has gone down much faster than any of us would have predicted even five years ago. So the key here is to set up the structure so that were sending signals all around the world:  This is happening.  Were not turning back.  And the thing about human ingenuity -- I was going to say American ingenuity, but there are other smart folks around too, dont want to be too parochial about this -- the thing about human ingenuity is, is that it responds when it gets a strong signal of what needs to be done. The old expression that necessity is the mother of invention -- well, this is necessary.  And us getting a strong, high-ambition agreement in place, even if it doesnt meet all the goals that we ultimately need to meet, sends a signal that its necessary and that will spur on the innovation thats going to ultimately meet our goals. Nancy Benac. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  One follow-up on the climate change issue.  Are you confident that you can hold the U.S. to its commitments under existing treaties with no new vote needed?", "filename": "01December2015ParisPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "On the issue of the climate fund, we already engage in assistance to countries for adaptation, mitigation, sharing technology that can help them meet their energy needs in a clean way.  And so this is not just one slug of funding that happens in one year -- this is multiyear commitments that, in many cases, are already embedded in a whole range of programs that we have around the world.  And my expectation is, is that we will absolutely be able to meet our commitments. This is part of American leadership, by the way.  And this is part of the debate that we have to have in the United States more frequently. For some reason, too often in Washington, American leadership is defined by whether or not were sending troops somewhere, and thats the sole definition of leadership.  And part of what Ive been trying to describe during the course of my presidency is that where we make the most impact -- and where, by the way, we strengthen our relationships and influence the most -- is when we are helping to organize the world around a particular problem. Now, because were the largest country, because we have the most powerful military, we should welcome the fact that were going to do more and oftentimes were going to do it first.  So during the Ebola response, other countries could not respond until we had set up the infrastructure to allow other countries to respond, and until we had made the call and showed that we were going to make that investment. The same was true with respect to making sure that Iran didnt get a nuclear weapon.  We had to lead the way, but, ultimately, because we reached out and brought our allies and partners together, we were able to achieve goals that we could not have achieved by ourselves. The same is true with climate.  When I made the announcement in Beijing with President Xi, I was able to do so in part because we had led domestically, so I could put my money where my mouth was, and I said, here are the tough political decisions were making, now what are you going to do?", "filename": "01December2015ParisPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "President.  Do you believe that Turkey is doing enough to strengthen its northwest border with Syria?  How is it that a NATO country with as large a military as Turkey has, has not sealed its border?  And is that something that you raised today with President Erdogan?

If you had said to people as recently as two years ago that wed have 180 countries showing up in Paris with pretty ambitious targets for carbon reduction, most people would have said youre crazy, thats a pipe dream.  And yet, here we are.  Thats already happened.  Before the agreement is even signed, thats already happened. As I said earlier, if you had told folks what the cost of generating solar energy would be today relative to what it was five years ago, people would have said, not a chance.  And with relatively modest inputs, thats already happening.  I mean, imagine if were starting to put more R&D dollars into it -- which is why the Mission Innovation announcement was so significant -- the biggest countries, the most prosperous countries doubling their R&D, but then youve also got Bill Gates and other extraordinarily wealthy individuals saying were going to put our money into this. Im optimistic.  I think were going to solve it.  I think the issue is just going to be the pace and how much damage is done before we are able to fully apply the brakes. And in some ways, its akin to the problem of terrorism and ISIL.  In the immediate aftermath of a terrible attack like happened here in Paris, sometimes its natural for people to despair.  But look at Paris.  You cant tear down Paris because of the demented actions of a handful individuals.  The beauty, the joy, the life, the culture, the people, the diversity -- thats going to win out every time. But we have to be steady in applying pressure to the problem.  We have to keep on going at it.  We have to see what works.  When something doesnt work, we have to change our approach.  But most of all, we have to push away fear, and have confidence that human innovation, our values, our judgment, our solidarity -- it will win out. And I guess Ive been at this long enough where I have some cause for confidence.  We went, what, a month, month and a half, where people were pretty sure that Ebola was going to kill us all?  Well, nobody asks me about it anymore.  And although we still see flickers of it in West Africa, we set up an entire global health security agenda -- part of American leadership -- to deal not only with Ebola but to deal with the possibility of future pandemics.  Its not easy.  It takes time.  And when youre in the midst of it, its frightening.  But its solvable. All right?", "filename": "01December2015ParisPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "I am fired up for the year that stretches out before us. Thats because of what weve accomplished together over the past seven. Seven years ago, our businesses were losing 800,000 jobs a month. Theyve now created jobs for 69 straight months, driving the unemployment rate from a high of 10% down to 5%. Seven years ago, too many Americans went without health insurance. Weve now covered more than 17 million people, dropping the rate of the uninsured below 10% for the very first time. Seven years ago, we were addicted to foreign oil. Now our oil imports have plummeted, our clean energy industry is booming, and America is a global leader in the fight against climate change. Seven years ago, there were only two states in America with marriage equality. And now there are 50. All of this progress is because of you. And weve got so much more to do. So my New Years resolution is to move forward on our unfinished business as much as I can. And Ill be more frequently asking for your help. Thats what this American project is all about. That's especially true for one piece of unfinished business, thats our epidemic of gun violence. Last month, we remembered the third anniversary Newtown. This Friday, Ill be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, five years into her recovery from the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful anniversaries every single day. And yet Congress still hasnt done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other families. Three years ago, a bipartisan, commonsense bill would have required background checks for virtually everyone who buys a gun. Keep in mind, this policy was supported by some 90% of the American people. It was supported by a majority of NRA households. But the gun lobby mobilized against it. And the Senate blocked it. Since then, tens of thousands of our fellow Americans have been mowed down by gun violence. Tens of thousands. Each time, were told that commonsense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, so we shouldnt do anything. We know that we cant stop every act of violence. But what if we tried to stop even one? What if Congress did something -- anything -- to protect our kids from gun violence?", "filename": "01January2016WeeklyAddressMakingAmericaSaferforOurChildren.txt"}, {"question": "So two years ago, we launched the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative -- YSEALI -- to help empower young people like you, to give you more of the skills and resources and networks that you need to turn your ideas into action.

And I want to thank his counterparts on the other side, including Senator Gregg, for their hard work. Now, the fact that we're even here voting on a plan to rescue our economy from the greed and irresponsibility of Wall Street and some in Washington is an outrage. It's an outrage to every American who works hard, pays their taxes, is doing their best every day to make a better life for themselves and their families. And understandably, people are frustrated and they're angry that Wall Street's mistakes have put their tax dollars at risk. And they should be. I'm frustrated and angry, too. But while there's plenty of blame to go around -- and many in Washington and Wall Street who deserve it, all of us -- all of us have a responsibility to solve this crisis, because it affects the financial well-being of every single American. There will be time to punish those who set this fire, but now is not the time to argue about how it got set, or did the neighbor sleep in his bed, or leave the stove on. Right now we want to put out that fire; and now's the time for us to come together and do that. When the House of Representatives failed to act on Monday, we saw the single largest decline in the stock market in two decades. Over one trillion dollars of wealth was lost by the time the markets closed. And it wasn't just the wealth of a few CEOs or Wall Street executives. The 401(k)s and retirement accounts of millions became smaller. The state pension funds of teachers and government employees lost billions upon billions of dollars. Hard-working Americans who invested their nest egg to watch it grow saw it diminish and in some cases disappear. And while that decline was devastating, the consequences of the credit crisis that caused it will be even worse if we do not act now. We're in a very dangerous situation, where financial institutions across this country are afraid to lend money. And if all that meant was the failure of a few banks in New York, that would be one thing. But that's not what it means. What it means is, if we don't act, it will be harder for Americans to get a mortgage for their home or loans they need to buy a car or send their children to college. What it means is that businesses won't be able to get the loans they need to open a new factory or make payroll for their workers. And if they can't make payroll on Friday, then workers are laid off on Monday. And if workers are laid off on Monday, then they can't pay their bills or pay back their loans to somebody else. And it will go on and on and on, rippling through the entire economy. And potentially we could see thousands of businesses close, millions of jobs could be lost, and a long and painful recession could follow. In other words, this is not just a Wall Street crisis; it's an American crisis. And it's the American economy that needs this rescue plan. I understand completely why people would be skeptical when this President asks for a blank check to solve this problem. I was, too, as was Senator Dodd and a whole bunch of us here. And that's why, over a week ago, I demanded that this plan include some specific proposals to protect taxpayers, protections that the Administration eventually agreed to, and, thanks to the hard work of Senator Dodd and Republican counterparts like Senator Gregg, we here in the Senate have agreed to, and now hopefully the House will agree to, as well. Let me just go over those principles: Number one, I said we needed an independent board to provide oversight and accountability for how and where this money is spent at every step of the way. Number two, I said that we cannot help banks on Wall Street without helping the millions of innocent homeowners who are struggling to stay in their homes. They deserve a plan, too. Number three, I said that I would not allow this plan to become a welfare program for Wall Street executives, whose greed and irresponsibility got us into this mess. And, finally, I said that, if American taxpayers are financing this solution, then they have to be treated like investors. They should get every penny of their tax dollars back once the economy recovers. Now, this last part is important, because it's been the most misunderstood and poorly communicated part of this plan. This is not a plan to just hand over 700 billion dollars of taxpayer money to a few banks. If this is managed correctly -- and that's an important \"if\" -- we will hopefully get most or all of our money back and possibly even turn a profit on the government's intervention, every penny of which will go directly back to the American people. And if we fall short, we will levy a fee on financial institutions so that they can repay for the losses that they caused. Now, let me -- let's acknowledge, even with all these taxpayer protections, this plan is not perfect. Democrats and Republicans in Congress have legitimate concerns about it. Some of my closest colleagues, people I have the greatest respect for, still have problems with it and may choose to vote against this bill, and I think that we can respectfully disagree. I understand their frustrations. I also know that many -- many Americans share their concerns. But it's clear that, from my perspective, this is what we need to do right now to prevent the possibility of a crisis turning into a catastrophe. It is conceivable -- it's possible that if we did nothing everything would turn out okay. It's -- There -- There's a possibility that that's true. And there's no doubt that there may be other plans out there that, had we had two or three or six months to develop, might be even more refined and might serve our purposes better. But we don't have that kind of time. And we can't afford to take a risk that the economy of the United States of America and, as a consequence, the worldwide economy could be plunged into a very, very deep hole. So to Democrats and Republicans who've opposed this plan, I say: Step up to the plate. Let's do what's right for the country at this time, because the time to act is now. I know many Americans are wondering what happens next. And passing this bill can't be the end of our work to strengthen our economy; it must be the beginning. Because one thing I -- I think all of us who may end up supporting this bill understand is that, even if we get this in place, we could still have enormous problems and probably will have big problems in the economy over the next several months and potentially longer; because the fact is, is that we have seen some mismanagement of the fundamentals of the economy for a very long time, and we are not going to dig ourselves out of that hole immediately. So this is not the end. This is the beginning. As soon as we pass this rescue plan, we need to move aggressively with the same sense of urgency to rescue families on Main Street who are struggling to pay their bills and keep their jobs. They've been in crisis a lot longer than Wall Street has. I've said it before and I say it again: We need to pass an economic stimulus package that will help ordinary Americans cope with rising food and gas prices, that can save one million jobs rebuilding our schools, and roads, and our infrastructure, and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increase[s], a -- a plan that would extend expiring unemployment benefits for those Americans who've lost their jobs and cannot find new ones. That's the right thing to do at a time when consumer confidence is down and we are in great danger of slipping into a big recession. We also must do more in this rescue package in order to help homeowners stay in their homes. I will continue to advocate bankruptcy reforms. I know my colleague from Illinois, Dick Durbin, has been a strong champion of this, as have many. It is the right thing to do to change our bankruptcy laws so that people have a better chance of staying in their homes and we're not seeing communities devastated all across the country. And we should encourage Treasury to study the option of buying individual mortgages, like we did successfully in the 1930s. And finally, while we all hope that this rescue package succeeds, we should be prepared to take more vigorous actions in the months ahead to rebuild capital, if it's necessary. Now, just as families are planning for their future in tough times, Washington's going to have to do the same. Runaway spending and record deficits are not how families run their budgets. It can't be how Washington handles people's tax dollars. So we're going to have to return to the fiscal responsibility we had in the 1990s. And the next White House and the next Congress is going to have to work together to make sure that we go through our budget, we get rid of programs that don't work, that we make the ones that do work better and cost less. With less money flowing into the Treasury, some useful programs or policies might need to be delayed. And some might be -- need to be stretched out over a longer period of time. But there are certain investments in our future that we cannot delay, precisely because our economy is in turmoil. Mr. President, I've exceeded the time a little bit.

That means theres another community stunned with grief, and communities across the country forced to relieve their own anguish, and parents across the country who are scared because they know it might have been their families or their children.   Ive been to Roseburg, Oregon.  There are really good people there.  I want to thank all the first responders whose bravery likely saved some lives today.  Federal law enforcement has been on the scene in a supporting role, and weve offered to stay and help as much as Roseburg needs, for as long as they need. In the coming days, well learn about the victims -- young men and women who were studying and learning and working hard, their eyes set on the future, their dreams on what they could make of their lives.  And America will wrap everyone whos grieving with our prayers and our love.   But as I said just a few months ago,1 and I said a few months before that,2 and I said each time we see one of these mass shootings, our thoughts and prayers are not enough.  Its not enough.  It does not capture the heartache and grief and anger that we should feel.  And it does nothing to prevent this carnage from being inflicted someplace else in America -- next week, or a couple of months from now. We don't yet know why this individual did what he did.  And it's fair to say that anybody who does this has a sickness in their minds, regardless of what they think their motivations may be.  But we are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people.  We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months.   Earlier this year, I answered a question in an interview by saying, The United States of America is the one advanced nation on Earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense gun-safety laws -- even in the face of repeated mass killings.3  And later that day, there was a mass shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana.  That day!  Somehow this has become routine.  The reporting is routine.  My response here at this podium ends up being routine.  The conversation in the aftermath of it.  We've become numb to this. We talked about this after Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston.  It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.   And whats become routine, of course, is the response of those who oppose any kind of common-sense gun legislation.  Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out:  We need more guns, theyll argue.  Fewer gun safety laws.   Does anybody really believe that?  There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country -- they know that's not true.  We know because of the polling that says the majority of Americans understand we should be changing these laws -- including the majority of responsible, law-abiding gun owners.   There is a gun for roughly every man, woman, and child in America.  So how can you, with a straight face, make the argument that more guns will make us safer?  We know that states with the most gun laws tend to have the fewest gun deaths.  So the notion that gun laws don't work, or just will make it harder for law-abiding citizens and criminals will still get their guns is not borne out by the evidence. We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings.  Friends of ours, allies of ours -- Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours.  So we know there are ways to prevent it.   And, of course, whats also routine is that somebody, somewhere will comment and say, Obama politicized this issue.  Well, this is something we should politicize.  It is relevant to our common life together, to the body politic.  I would ask news organizations -- because I won't put these facts forward -- have news organizations tally up the number of Americans whove been killed through terrorist attacks over the last decade and the number of Americans whove been killed by gun violence, and post those side-by-side on your news reports.  This won't be information coming from me; it will be coming from you.  We spend over a trillion dollars, and pass countless laws, and devote entire agencies to preventing terrorist attacks on our soil, and rightfully so.  And yet, we have a Congress that explicitly blocks us from even collecting data on how we could potentially reduce gun deaths.

The Islamic Republic of Iran has been advancing its nuclear program for decades.  By the time I took office, Iran was operating thousands of centrifuges, which can produce the materials for a nuclear bomb -- and Iran was concealing a covert nuclear facility.  I made clear that we were prepared to resolve this issue diplomatically, but only if Iran came to the table in a serious way.  When that did not happen, we rallied the world to impose the toughest sanctions in history -- sanctions which had a profound impact on the Iranian economy. Now, sanctions alone could not stop Irans nuclear program. But they did help bring Iran to the negotiating table.  Because of our diplomatic efforts, the world stood with us and we were joined at the negotiating table by the worlds major powers -- the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, and China, as well as the European Union. Over a year ago, we took the first step towards todays framework with a deal to stop the progress of Irans nuclear program and roll it back in key areas.  And recall that at the time, skeptics argued that Iran would cheat, and that we could not verify their compliance and the interim agreement would fail. Instead, it has succeeded exactly as intended.  Iran has met all of its obligations.  It eliminated its stockpile of dangerous nuclear material.  Inspections of Irans program increased.  And we continued negotiations to see if we could achieve a more comprehensive deal. Today, after many months of tough, principled diplomacy, we have achieved the framework for that deal.  And it is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives.  This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon.  Iran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history.  So this deal is not based on trust, its based on unprecedented verification.  Many key details will be finalized over the next three months, and nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed.  But here are the basic outlines of the deal that we are working to finalize. First, Iran will not be able to pursue a bomb using plutonium, because it will not develop weapons-grade plutonium.  The core of its reactor at Arak will be dismantled and replaced. The spent fuel from that facility will be shipped out of Iran for the life of the reactor.  Iran will not build a new heavy-water reactor.  And Iran will not reprocess fuel from its existing reactors -- ever. Second, this deal shuts down Irans path to a bomb using enriched uranium. Iran has agreed that its installed centrifuges will be reduced by two-thirds.  Iran will no longer enrich uranium at its Fordow facility.  Iran will not enrich uranium with its advanced centrifuges for at least the next 10 years.  The vast majority of Irans stockpile of enriched uranium will be neutralized. Today, estimates indicate that Iran is only two or three months away from potentially acquiring the raw materials that could be used for a single nuclear bomb.  Under this deal, Iran has agreed that it will not stockpile the materials needed to build a weapon.  Even if it violated the deal, for the next decade at least, Iran would be a minimum of a year away from acquiring enough material for a bomb.  And the strict limitations on Irans stockpile will last for 15 years. Third, this deal provides the best possible defense against Irans ability to pursue a nuclear weapon covertly -- that is, in secret.  International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities, but to the entire supply chain that supports Irans nuclear program -- from uranium mills that provide the raw materials, to the centrifuge production and storage facilities that support the program.  If Iran cheats, the world will know it.  If we see something suspicious, we will inspect it.  Irans past efforts to weaponize its program will be addressed.  With this deal, Iran will face more inspections than any other country in the world. So this will be a long-term deal that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb.  There will be strict limits on Irans program for a decade.  Additional restrictions on building new facilities or stockpiling materials will last for 15 years.  The unprecedented transparency measures will last for 20 years or more.  Indeed, some will be permanent.  And as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran will never be permitted to develop a nuclear weapon. In return for Irans actions, the international community has agreed to provide Iran with relief from certain sanctions -- our own sanctions, and international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council.  This relief will be phased as Iran takes steps to adhere to the deal.  If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place.  Meanwhile, other American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses, its ballistic missile program, will continue to be fully enforced. Now, let me reemphasize, our work is not yet done.  The deal has not been signed.  Between now and the end of June, the negotiators will continue to work through the details of how this framework will be fully implemented, and those details matter.  If there is backsliding on the part of the Iranians, if the verification and inspection mechanisms dont meet the specifications of our nuclear and security experts, there will be no deal.  But if we can get this done, and Iran follows through on the framework that our negotiators agreed to, we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully. Given the importance of this issue, I have instructed my negotiators to fully brief Congress and the American people on the substance of the deal, and I welcome a robust debate in the weeks and months to come.  I am confident that we can show that this deal is good for the security of the United States, for our allies, and for the world. For the fact is, we only have three options for addressing Irans nuclear program.  First, we can reach a robust and verifiable deal -- like this one -- and peacefully prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The second option is we can bomb Irans nuclear facilities, thereby starting another war in the Middle East, and setting back Irans program by a few years -- in other words, setting it back by a fraction of the time that this deal will set it back.  Meanwhile wed ensure that Iran would race ahead to try and build a bomb. Third, we could pull out of negotiations, try to get other countries to go along and continue sanctions that are currently in place or add additional ones, and hope for the best -- knowing that every time we have done so, Iran has not capitulated but instead has advanced its program, and that in very short order, the breakout timeline would be eliminated and a nuclear arms race in the region could be triggered because of that uncertainty.  In other words, the third option leads us very quickly back to a decision about whether or not to take military action, because wed have no idea what was going on inside of Iran. Iran is not going to simply dismantle its program because we demand it to do so.  Thats not how the world works, and thats not what history shows us.  Iran has shown no willingness to eliminate those aspects of their program that they maintain are for peaceful purposes, even in the face of unprecedented sanctions.  Should negotiations collapse because we, the United States, rejected what the majority of the world considers a fair deal, what our scientists and nuclear experts suggest would give us confidence that they are not developing a nuclear weapon, its doubtful that we can even keep our current international sanctions in place.  So when you hear the inevitable critics of the deal sound off, ask them a simple question:  Do you really think that this verifiable deal, if fully implemented, backed by the worlds major powers, is a worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East?  Is it worse than doing what weve done for almost two decades, with Iran moving forward with its nuclear program and without robust inspections?", "filename": "02April2015StatementonIranNuclearAgreement.txt"}, {"question": "Last year, I welcomed Francis and some of you to the White House to launch our BRAIN Initiative to unlock the mysteries of the mind and to pursue new cures for disease.

But the work you do here is remarkable, and I just got a fascinating tour of your vaccine research center.  I have to say, I was very impressed with how you can clone a virus gene into a vaccine vector, then subject it to gel electrophoresis.  And then pipet the samples into a 96-well microplate.  Run it through the worlds most advanced multiparameter flow cytometer.  I mean, it was impressive.  Ive been tinkering around the White House, setting up a similar system.  We use it for brewing beer.  But it works well for your work also. Now, the last time I was here at NIH, early in my presidency, I came to announce a historic boost in funding for biomedical research.  Because part of American leadership in the world -- one of the things that has always marked us as exceptional -- is our leadership in science and our leadership in research.  And here at NIH, you have always been at the forefront of groundbreaking innovations.  Youve helped pioneer new treatments for everything from cancer to heart disease to HIV/AIDS.  And as a consequence, youve helped not just Americans but people around the world live longer, fuller lives.  Youve saved countless lives in every corner of the globe.  And so to Francis and Tony, and all your directors and staff, and the researchers that you fund across the country and around the globe, you deserve great thanks for your leadership, and your service, and your patriotism, and your lifesaving work. And that brings me back to today.  This past summer, as Ebola spread in West Africa, I told my team that fighting this disease had to be a national security priority, and a priority across agencies and across our government.  I realize that here in the United States, some of the attention has shifted away recently -- thats sort of how our attention spans work sometimes.  Ebola is not leading the news right now.  But I wanted to come here because, every day, were focused on keeping the American people safe.  Every day, the NIH is at the forefront of this mission.  NIH personnel have volunteered and deployed to West Africa.  Some have served in medical labs, testing for Ebola.  Some of your clinicians -- members of the U.S. Public Health Service -- have deployed to care for health care workers who got infected in the line of duty. When Nina Pham, one of the two Dallas nurses who were infected, needed treatment, Tony and his team stepped up and you were ready.  You manned shifts around the clock, day and night.  You remembered your training.  You displayed great skill and professionalism.  You reminded the world that it is possible to treat Ebola patients effectively and safely without endangering yourselves or others. And all that has made an enormous difference.  Like a lot of Americans, I know you fell in love with Nina-- she was so sweet and big smile, her optimism, her sense of service, and reminded us -- she reminded us of the incredible sacrifices that our tireless nurses make every day, and we can never thank them enough.  And I know Tony thanks Nina for teaching him how to FaceTime.  And after she was released, Ebola-free, I was proud to welcome Nina to the Oval Office and give her a big hug, and shes now back home in Texas, recovering, getting stronger.  And we remember what she told the world when she was released:  \"Throughout this ordeal, I have put my trust in God and my medical team.\"  And we thank everyone on her team at the NIH Clinical Center who delivered such remarkable care to Nina. But the point is, is that the work that you have done has continued even if the cameras have gone elsewhere.  And the urgency remains, because if we are going to actually solve this problem for ourselves, we have to solve it in West Africa as well.  And one of the great virtues of what youve done here at NIH is reminded people that science matters and that science works.  Its not always going to be immediate; sometimes its going to be iterative and there are going to be some trials and there are going to be some errors and false starts and blind alleys, but the basic concept of subjecting hypotheses to tests and seeing if they work and being able to document them and replicate them -- the basic concept of science -- and making judgments on the basis of evidence, thats whats most needed during difficult, challenging moments like the ones that we had this summer and that we continue to have in West Africa. Last week, just in time for Thanksgiving, NIH and your partners gave us something new to be thankful for, and that was news of the first successful step - completion of the Phase 1 clinical trials -- of a potential Ebola vaccine.  And on my tour just now, Doctors Nancy Sullivan and Mario Roederer showed me how they and their teams did it.  And I have to say both Nancy and Mario were really good teachers and were very patient with my rudimentary questions, and the lasers were really cool.  No potential Ebola vaccine has ever made it this far.  So this is exciting news.  But its also a reminder of the importance of government-funded research and our need to keep investing in basic research. Because Nancy, as she was talking about the steps that had been taken, showed me -- this is the kind of mementos scientists keep I guess -- is there was some numbers on a little chart -- from back in 1999? -- in which she had first done some experiments and trials on the Ebola virus.  So this is the product not just of last years work; its the product of over a decade of inquiry and work.  And at the time, when -- Nancy was explaining when she first had some breakthroughs in understanding the Ebola virus, nobody really gave a hoot.  Until you do.  And thats part of how science works -- you make investments and you pursue knowledge for knowledges sake, in part because it turns out that knowledge may turn out useful later and you dont always know when. Last weeks news is still just a first step.  There are no guarantees.  But Dr. Cliff Lane, who is here, is working with Liberian officials to begin large-scale tests in that country.  And other potential Ebola vaccines are also in the works.  I know that here at NIH youre also working on potential treatments for Ebola.  As you move ahead on all these fronts, I want you to know you have your Presidents full support, and the administrations full support. You are a vital part of our fight against Ebola, across our government.  Today, we released an update on our efforts, here in the United States and abroad.  And it shows that, because weve stepped up our efforts in recent months, were more prepared when it comes to protecting Americans here at home.  Were screening and monitoring arrivals from the affected countries. Weve equipped more hospitals with new protective gear and protocols.  Weve conducted outreach and training of hundreds of thousands of healthcare workers. A few months ago, only 13 states could test for Ebola; today 36 states can.  Previously, there were only three facilities in the country deemed capable of treating an Ebola patient, including NIH.  Today, were announcing that we now have 35 Treatment Centers designated to care for a patient with Ebola.  So this is important progress.  And were going to just keep on at it.  And throughout, we are going to be guided by the science -- not by speculation, not by fear, not by rumor, not by panic -- by science. Now, part of what the science and epidemiology and experience has taught us -- and Ive said this all along -- is the best way to fight this disease, to protect Americans, is to stop it at its source.  And thats why the United States continues to lead the global response in West Africa.  Some 3,000 of our servicemembers and civilians are now on the ground -- manning that air bridge, moving in supplies, building treatment units.  I called some of our troops in West Africa on Thanksgiving to express gratitude and they were inspiring, the can-do spirit that they displayed. The new Medical Unit we built in Liberia to treat health workers opened last month and has begun discharging patients Ebola-free.  Weve ramped up the capacity to train hundreds of new health workers per week.  Weve helped improve burial practices across Liberia.  And as a consequence, weve seen some encouraging news:  A decline in infection rates in Liberia.  And meanwhile, over the last few months, the United States has helped rally the international community.  Weve mobilized more than $2 billion in commitments to this fight because this has to truly be a global effort.  But that money would not be there had it not been for U.S. leadership. So our strategy is beginning to show results.  Were seeing some progress.  But the fight is not even close to being over.  As long as this disease continues to rage in West Africa, we could continue to see isolated cases here in America.  In West Africa, this remains the worst Ebola epidemic in history by a long shot.  And although weve made some progress in Liberia, weve still got work to do.  We are seeing that we still have a lot of work in Guinea, and its actually been getting worse in Sierra Leone despite some good efforts from our British partners.  And this can still spread to other countries, as weve seen in Mali.  Every hot-spot is an ember that, if not contained, could become a new fire.  So we cannot let down our guard, even for a minute.  And we cant just fight this epidemic; we have to extinguish it. Much of the progress weve made -- and the progress we still need to make -- depends on funding thats running out.  We cant beat Ebola without more funding.  This is an expensive enterprise.  And that money is running out.  We cannot beat Ebola without more funding.  If we want other countries to keep stepping up, we will have to continue to lead the way.  And thats why Im calling on Congress to approve our emergency funding request to fight this disease before they leave for the holidays.  Its a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world. The funding were asking for is needed to keep strengthening our capacity here at home, so we can respond to any future Ebola cases.  The funding allows us to keep making progress in West Africa.  Remember, we have to extinguish this disease -- this is not something that we can just manage with a few cases here and there; weve got to stamp it out.  The funding is needed to speed up testing and approval of any promising Ebola vaccines and treatments, including those here at the NIH.  Its needed to help us partner with other countries to prevent and deal with future outbreaks and threats before they become epidemics. This is something I want to just focus on for a second.  Tony and I were fondly reminiscing about SARS and H1N1.  Thats what these guys do for fun.  And we were lucky with H1N1 -- that it did not prove to be more deadly.  We cant say were lucky with Ebola because obviously its having a devastating effect in West Africa but it is not airborne in its transmission. There may and likely will come a time in which we have both an airborne disease that is deadly.  And in order for us to deal with that effectively, we have to put in place an infrastructure -- not just here at home, but globally -- that allows us to see it quickly, isolate it quickly, respond to it quickly.  And it also requires us to continue the same path of basic research that is being done here at NIH that Nancy is a great example of.  So that if and when a new strain of flu, like the Spanish flu, crops up five years from now or a decade from now, weve made the investment and were further along to be able to catch it.  It is a smart investment for us to make.  Its not just insurance; it is knowing that down the road were going to continue to have problems like this -- particularly in a globalized world where you move from one side of the world to the other in a day. So this is important now, but its also important for our future and our childrens future and our grandchildrens future.  And the last few elections, the American people have sent Washington a pretty clear message:  Find areas where you agree, dont let the areas where you disagree shut things down, work together and get the job done. I cannot think of a better example of an area where we should all agree than passing this emergency funding to fight Ebola and to set up some of the public health infrastructure that we need to deal with potential outbreaks in the future.  How do you argue with that?  That is not a partisan issue.  That is a basic, common-sense issue that all Americans can agree on. Now, I have to say Ive been very encouraged so far by the bipartisan support in our various visits with members of Congress.  For the most part, people have recognized this is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue -- its about the safety and security of the American people.  So lets get it done.  This can get caught up in normal politics -- we need to protect the American people and we need to show the world how American leads. I have to tell you, I traveled to Asia, we had the G20 Summit -- if America had not led, if I had not been able to go to CDC, make a major announcement about the commitments we were going to make, be able to go to the United Nations and basically call on other countries to step up, and know that we were following through with our own commitments, had we not done that, the world would not have responded in the same way.  American leadership matters every time.  We set the tone and we set the agenda. Now, in closing, I want to leave with a story that speaks to what we have to do.  Nancy Writebol, is from Charlotte, North Carolina.  Shes a mom, grandma, wife, also a Christian missionary.  Along with her husband, she went to Liberia.  She was doing Gods work - caring for Ebola patients.  Its hard to imagine a greater expression of the Christian ethic.  And she was then infected herself.  So she was brought back to Emory in Atlanta, she received excellent care.  Nancy was released in August.  She is Ebola-free, she continues to recover.  And she said this about how people treat her, even today:  \"You have some people that just totally wrap their arms around you, and shake your hand.  And then you have other people that stand 10 feet away.\" Some people wrap their arms around you.  Some people stand 10 feet away.  This disease is not just a test of our health systems; it is a test of our character as a nation.  It asks us who we are as Americans.  When we see a problem in the world -- like thousands of people dying from a disease that we know how to fight -- do we stand 10 feet away, or 10,000 miles away, or do we lead and deploy and go to help?", "filename": "02December2014NIHEbolaVaccineResearchAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Take a look at what Arne has accomplished over the last six and a half years.  Hes one of the longest-serving Secretaries of Education in our history -- and one of the more consequential.  In just a few years, Arne and his team have delivered some incredible results at every stage of the educational experience. More than 30 states have upped their investment in early childhood education.  Nearly every state in America has raised standards for teaching and learning, and expectations for what our kids can learn, and our high school graduation rate is at an all-time high.  Weve helped millions more families afford college, and more Americans are graduating from college than ever before.  And thats just scratching the surface. Arne has done more to bring our educational system -- sometimes kicking and screaming -- into the 21st century than anybody else.  America is going to be better off for what he has done.  It's going to be more competitive and more prosperous.  It is going to be more equal and more upwardly mobile.  Its a record that I truly believe no other Education Secretary can match.  Arne bleeds this stuff.  He cares so much about our kids. And he's been so passionate about this work.  And everybody who interacts with him, including people who disagree with him on some issues, never questions the genuineness and heart that he has brought to this job.   So I couldn't be prouder of him.  And, for good measure, Arne also holds the record for most points scored in an NBA All-Star game.  And he is my favorite partner in pickup basketball -- the smartest player I know -- even though hes very slow -- and has no hops.  He knows it's true.  I will say, watching Ryan, by the way, that the son will soon be surpassing the father because this young man has got game. Now, keep in mind, none of this change has been easy, and we still have a long way to go.  One of the things about education is that it doesnt deliver results tomorrow or the next day; this is a decade-long or longer proposition.   We plant seeds now; we make changes now; and we watch each successive class benefit from these reforms.  And it goes in fits and starts, and we have a decentralized system -- that's how our education tradition evolved.  So it's not easy and it's not quick, but we are making progress.  And we're not going to stop in these last 15 months. And that's why it's so important and why I think we're very lucky that, even as Arne steps down, we've got an exceptionally talented educator to step in -- and that is Dr. John King.   John is already on Arnes leadership team.  Hes been an educator all his life -- a teacher, a principal, a leader of schools, the New York States education chief.  Hes the right man to lead the department.  He shares our commitment to preparing every child for success in a more innovative and competitive world.  Hes got a great team already at the Department of Education of which I am very, very proud.  His family is equally cool and good-looking.  (Laughter.)  And he has equally exceptional children.  And I know that, together, we're going to continue to be able to do great things on behalf of all our kids. So, Arne and John, I want to wish both of you a hardy congratulations and good luck. Now I'm going to let them say a few words, and then I'm just going to make a few remarks before I take some questions from the press.  We'll start with Arne. Secretary Duncan:  I've cried more today than I have in a while, so I'll try not to get up here and cry.   Ill start with the President.  And when he asked us to come to D.C. and work with him, that was about a one-minute conversation with my wife.  And it wasnt that we wanted to leave Chicago; it wasnt that I necessarily wanted to be the Education Secretary -- I just wanted to be on his team and believed so much in what he was about and what he stood for.   And I have to say, seven and a half years later, my admiration is only greater.  And its pretty remarkable -- its important for the folks to know, that every hard decision, his only question was, whats the right thing to do for kids, and challenging us and our team to fight for kids every single day.  And often, that was a hard political decision, and that was never a factor.  His passion and his commitment has been absolutely extraordinary.  For me, its not the political leadership; its not the educational leadership; its the moral leadership.   And I just cant tell you, Mr. President, personally, what an unbelievable honor it was just to spend some time.   And for those -- every day you see -- for folks who watched him last night talking about the horrendous massacre, gun massacre in Oregon, and how preventable these things are, we need that moral leadership. And please keep that fight To our team, the team you have at the White House -- Cecilia and Denis and Valerie and others -- its been extraordinary to work with DPC.  I dont say this lightly -- I think our team at the Department of Education is stronger than its ever been.  You never know over seven, eight years, how those teams go, and do you have the B team towards the end -- well, I think we have the A team and a combination of being able to work with the White House -- Shaun and Sylvia and so many folks are here -- Anthony. We have the team in place.  Im just extraordinarily hopeful and confident about what they can do together.   Emma and Ted, and the rest of the crew -- you said a little bit about John -- and folks know, for all of us, this work is very, very personal.  For the President, its very personal.  For me its very personal.  John was one of those kids that probably shouldnt be in a room like this, if you sort of look at the stereotypes.  And not the easiest time growing up -- hell tell you more about it -- he lost both his parents at a pretty early age; went to live with his brother.  That wasnt very easy either.  But he had an amazing teacher who saw something in him, who kept him going.  And today, he gets to stand here with the President.   And so many times, I think we, as a society, write off kids that look like John and come from places like John.  And to see what he can accomplish -- I think thats what drives all of us.  We know there are so many other kids out there we can reach. And while Im deeply, deeply sad to be leaving, Im extraordinarily happy and thankful and proud that John is going to carry on this work with the team.  So I want to thank everybody for their hard work. I quickly want to -- try not to get emotional here -- but thank my parents, as well.  My dad was a lifelong educator at the University of Chicago, taught throughout his life.  My mother started an inner-city tutoring program before we were born, and raised all of us as a part of that program.  And that changed our lives.  And all our life, we saw what kids could do when they were given a chance.  And thats why we do this work today.  And to be able to see what she did at one little corner at 46th and Greenwood, and to now have a chance over the past six and a half years to try and have an impact around the nation, because this man gave us a chance -- for my family, I cant tell you how much it means to us. And then, finally, just to my family.  I love this work.  I love this team.  I love the President.  I love the chance to serve.  The only thing I love more is you guys.  And I cant wait to come home and see a couple more track meets and maybe get to coach Ryan a little bit, and maybe have a few more dinners, and maybe go to a movie someday -- that would be pretty amazing. President Obama:  Wow! All right! Secretary Duncan:  Its been too long.  And so its been an amazing, amazing journey and I feel so proud and so lucky to have been a part of this team.  And, Mr. President, thanks for creating the climate in which all of us here -- all of us here --could have the impact we did.  And we can never repay the debt of gratitude we owe you for your leadership and your courage.  So thank you so much.   And I want to turn it over to John. Secretary King:  Thank you, Arne, for very kind words.  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to serve and for the faith that you've placed in me and the team that we have at the department. Im deeply honored by the chance to serve and also deeply humbled by following in Arnes footsteps.  Arne is an extraordinary leader who I have watched demonstrate tremendous courage in fighting for kids and fighting for whats best for kids; but also hes been willing to listen -- to listen to folks and to make adjustments, and to make sure that everything we do every day is towards the goal of greater equity. Mr. President, you and Arne and our team at the department have laid out an ambitious agenda -- from strengthening early childhood education and expanding access to early childhood, to raising standards for teaching and learning in K through 12, to ensuring that more Americans have access to high-quality higher education, to ensuring that we support our teachers and that we invest in our teachers and provide the best preparation and support and leadership opportunities for them.  Its an incredible agenda, and Im proud to be able to carry it forward with the amazing team that we have at the department.  Earlier this week, Arne gave a speech at the National Press Club, and in that speech, Arne said education can be the difference between life and death.  And I know that's true because it was for me.  I grew up in Brooklyn.  I lost my mom when I was eight; my dad when I was 12.  My dad was very sick before he passed.  I moved around between family members and schools.  But teachers, New York City public school teachers, are the reason that I am alive.  They are the reason that I became a teacher.  They are the reason I am standing here today.  Those teachers created amazing educational experiences, but also gave me hope -- hope about what is possible, what could be possible for me in life. I know schools can't do it alone.  Theres work we have to do on economic development and housing and health care.  But I know that my parents -- who spent their lives as New York City public school educators -- believed that school was at the heart of our promise of equality of opportunity for all Americans.  That's what they believed.  That's what the President believes.  That's what Arne believes.  And that's what I feel very privileged to be able to work on with this amazing team we have at the department.  Every child in the United States, every college student, every disconnected youth, every working parent who just wants a few more credits in order to improve their salary and position at their job -- everyone deserves the kind of opportunity that I had to have a great education.  Every child deserves the kind of opportunity that my beautiful daughters, Amina and Mireya, have to have a great education, the kind of education their grandparents worked to provide. Im so grateful to my very supportive wife, Melissa.  So grateful to the Secretary for the opportunity he gave me to join his team, and incredibly grateful to the President for the opportunity to work with a wonderful group of people at the Education Department to try to expand opportunity.   Thank you. President Obama:  Thank you. Two good men, doing really important work.  So I'm lucky to have them, both as colleagues and as friends, and I'm looking forward to seeing even more work done in the next few months. We've got some other business to attend to.  So all of you who are here to celebrate Arne and John, you're lucky enough now to have to sit through -- a little bit of a press conference with me.  So make yourselves comfortable.  I warned the kids ahead of time.  I said, try not to look completely bored. I'm going to take a couple of questions from the press.  But first, a few additional pieces of business. First of all, we learned today that our businesses created another 118,000 new jobs in September, which means that we now have had 67 straight months of job creation; 13.2 million new jobs in all -- and an unemployment rate that has fallen from a high of 10 percent down to 5.1 percent.  These long-term trends are obviously good news, particularly for every American waking up each morning and heading off to a new job. But we would be doing even better if we didnt have to keep on dealing with unnecessary crises in Congress every few months. And this is especially important right now, because although the American economy has been chugging along at a steady pace, much of the global economy is softening.  Weve seen an impact on our exports, which was a major driver of growth for us particularly at the beginning of the recovery.  And so our own growth could slow if Congress does not do away with some of the counterproductive austerity measures that they have put in place, and if Congress does not avoid the kind of manufactured crises that shatter consumer confidence and could disrupt an already skittish global economy.  On Wednesday, more than half of Republicans voted to shut down the government for the second time in two years.  The good news is that there were enough votes in both parties to pass a last-minute bill to keep the government open and operating for another 10 weeks before we can get a more long-term solution.  But keep in mind that gimmick only sets up another potential manufactured crisis just two weeks before Christmas.  And Ive said this before, I want to repeat it -- this is not the way the United States should be operating. Oftentimes I hear from folks up on Capitol Hill, the need for American leadership, the need for America to be number one.  Well, you know what, around the globe, part of what makes us a leader is when we govern effectively and we keep our own house in order, and we pass budgets, and we can engage in long-term planning, and we can invest in the things that are important for the future.  Thats U.S. leadership.  When we fail to do that, we diminish U.S. leadership.  Its not how we are supposed to operate.  And we cant just keep on kicking down the road without solving any problems or doing any long-term planning for the future.  Thats true for our military; thats true for our domestic programs.  The American people, American families deserve better.  And we can grow faster and the economy can improve if Congress acts with dispatch.  It will get worse if they don't.  Thats why I want to be very clear:  I will not sign another shortsighted spending bill like the one Congress sent me this week.  We purchased ourselves 10 additional weeks; we need to use them effectively. Keep in mind that a few years ago, both parties put in place harmful automatic cuts that make no distinction between spending we dont need and spending we do.  We can revisit the history of how that happened -- I have some rather grim memories of it.  But the notion was that even as we were bringing down the deficit, we would come up with a sustainable, smart, long-term approach to investing in the things that we need.  That didn't happen.  And so now these cuts that have been maintained have been keeping our economy from growing faster.  Its time to undo them.  If we dont, then we will have to fund our economic and national security priorities in 2016 at the same levels that we did in 2006. Now, understand, during that decade, between 2006 and 2016, our economy has grown by 12 percent.  Our population has grown by 8 percent.  New threats have emerged; new opportunities have appeared.  We cant fund our country the way we did 10 years ago because we have greater demands -- with an aging population, with kids who need schools, with roads that need to be fixed, with a military on which we are placing extraordinary demands. And we cant cut our way to prosperity.  Other countries have tried it and it has not worked.  Weve grown faster than they have because we did not pursue these blind, unthinking cuts to necessary investments for our growth.  And by the way, because weve grown faster than them, weve brought our deficits down faster than they have.  I want to repeat this because the public apparently never believes it.  Since I took office, weve cut our deficits by two-thirds.  The deficit has not been going up; it has been coming down -- precipitously.  Weve cut our deficits by two-thirds.  Theyre below the average deficits over the past 40 years. So the bottom line is, Congress has to do its job.  It can't flirt with another shutdown.  It should pass a serious budget.  And if they do, and get rid of some of these mindless cuts, even as we're still prudent about maintaining the spending that we need but not spending we don't need and is not working, their own non-partisan budget office estimates were going to add an extra half-million jobs to our economy next year alone.  We can immediately put half a million more people back to work if we just have a more sensible budget.  And in these negotiations, nobody is going to get everything they want.  We have to work together, though, even if we disagree, in order to do the peoples business.  At some point we have to want to govern, and not just play politics or play to various political bases.  At some point, we need to pass bills so that we can rebuild our roads, and keep our kids learning, and our military strong, and help people prepare for and recover from disasters.  That is Congresss most basic job.  Thats what our government is supposed to do -- serve the American people. So with that, let me take some questions.  And Ill start with Julie Pace of AP.  Hang in there, kids. Question:  It will be over soon.  Thank you, Mr. President.  There have been several developments in Syria that I wanted to ask you about, starting with Russias involvement.  You met with President Putin earlier this week, and I wonder if you think he was honest with you about his intentions in Syria.  If Russia is targeting groups beyond the Islamic State, including U.S.-aligned groups, does the U.S. military have an obligation to protect them?  And on the situation in Syria more broadly, there have obviously been failures in the U.S. train-and-equip program.  Do you believe that that program can be fixed or do you have to look at other options?  Would you, in particular, be willing to reconsider a no-fly zone, which several presidential candidates, including your former Secretary of State, are now calling for? President Obama:  Well, first and foremost, lets understand whats happening in Syria and how we got here.  What started off as peaceful protests against Assad, the president, evolved into a civil war because Assad met those protests with unimaginable brutality.  And so this is not a conflict between the United States and any party in Syria; this is a conflict between the Syrian people and a brutal, ruthless dictator. Point number two is that the reason Assad is still in power is because Russia and Iran have supported him throughout this process.  And in that sense, what Russia is doing now is not particularly different from what they had been doing in the past -- theyre just more overt about it.  Theyve been propping up a regime that is rejected by an overwhelming majority of the Syrian population because theyve seen that he has been willing to drop barrel bombs on children and on villages indiscriminately, and has been more concerned about clinging to power than the state of his country. So in my discussions with President Putin, I was very clear that the only way to solve the problem in Syria is to have a political transition that is inclusive -- that keeps the state intact, that keeps the military intact, that maintains cohesion, but that is inclusive -- and the only way to accomplish that is for Mr. Assad to transition, because you cannot rehabilitate him in the eyes of Syrians.  This is not a judgment Im making; it is a judgment that the overwhelming majority of Syrians make. And I said to Mr. Putin that Id be prepared to work with him if he is willing to broker with his partners, Mr. Assad and Iran, a political transition -- we can bring the rest of the world community to a brokered solution -- but that a military solution alone, an attempt by Russia and Iran to prop up Assad and try to pacify the population is just going to get them stuck in a quagmire.  And it wont work.  And they will be there for a while if they dont take a different course. I also said to him that it is true that the United States and Russia and the entire world have a common interest in destroying ISIL.  But what was very clear -- and regardless of what Mr. Putin said -- was that he doesnt distinguish between ISIL and a moderate Sunni opposition that wants to see Mr. Assad go.  From their perspective, theyre all terrorists.  And thats a recipe for disaster, and its one that I reject. So where we are now is that we are having technical conversations about de-confliction so that were not seeing U.S. and American firefights in the air.  But beyond that, were very clear in sticking to our belief and our policy that the problem here is Assad and the brutality that he has inflicted on the Syrian people, and that it has to stop.  And in order for it to stop, were prepared to work with all the parties concerned.  But we are not going to cooperate with a Russian campaign to simply try to destroy anybody who is disgusted and fed up with Mr. Assads behavior. Keep in mind also, from a practical perspective, the moderate opposition in Syria is one that if were ever going to have to have a political transition, we need.  And the Russian policy is driving those folks underground or creating a situation in which they are de-capacitated, and its only strengthening ISIL.  And thats not good for anybody. In terms of our support of opposition groups inside of Syria, I made very clear early on that the United States couldnt impose a military solution on Syria either, but that it was in our interest to make sure that we were engaged with moderate opposition inside of Syria because eventually Syria will fall, the Assad regime will fall, and we have to have somebody who were working with that we can help pick up the pieces and stitch back together a cohesive, coherent country.  And so we will continue to support them. The training-and-equip program was a specific initiative by the Defense Department to see if we could get some of that moderate opposition to focus attention on ISIL in the eastern portion of the country.  And Im the first one to acknowledge it has not worked the way it was supposed to, Julie.  And I think that the Department of Defense would say the same thing.  And part of the reason, frankly, is because when we tried to get them to just focus on ISIL, the response wed get back is, how can we focus on ISIL when every single day were having barrel bombs and attacks from the regime?  And so its been hard to get them to reprioritize, looking east, when theyve got bombs coming at them from the west. So what were doing with the train-and-equip is looking at where we have had success -- for example, working with some of the Kurdish community in the east that pushed ISIL out -- seeing if we can build on that.  But what we're also going to continue to do is to have contacts with and work with opposition that, rightly, believes that in the absence of some change of government inside of Syria we're going to continue to see civil war, and that is going to turbocharge ISIL recruitment and jihadist recruitment, and we're going to continue to have problems. Now, last point I just want to make about this -- because sometimes the conversation here in the Beltway differs from the conversation internationally.  Mr. Putin had to go into Syria not out of strength but out of weakness, because his client, Mr. Assad, was crumbling.  And it was insufficient for him simply to send them arms and money; now hes got to put in his own planes and his own pilots.  And the notion that he put forward a plan and that somehow the international community sees that as viable because there is a vacuum there -- I didn't see, after he made that speech in the United Nations, suddenly the 60-nation coalition that we have start lining up behind him.  Iran and Assad make up Mr. Putins coalition at the moment. The rest of the world makes up ours.  So I don't think people are fooled by the current strategy.  It does not mean that we could not see Mr. Putin begin to recognize that it is in their interest to broker a political settlement.  And as I said in New York, we're prepared to work with the Russians and the Iranians, as well as our partners who are part of the anti-ISIL coalition to come up with that political transition.  And nobody pretends that its going to be easy, but I think it is still possible.  And so we will maintain lines of communication.  But we are not going to be able to get those negotiations going if there is not a recognition that theres got to be a change in government.  We're not going to go back to the status quo ante.  And the kinds of airstrikes against moderate opposition that Russia is engaging in is going to be counterproductive.  Its going to move us farther away rather than towards the ultimate solution that we're all -- that we all should be looking for. Question:  [Inaudible] President Obama:  Julie, throughout this process, I think people have constantly looked for an easy, low-cost answer -- whether its we should have sent more rifles in early and somehow then everything would have been okay; or if I had taken that shot even after Assad offered to give up his chemical weapons, then immediately things would have folded, or the Assad regime would have folded, and we would have suddenly seen a peaceful Syria.  This is a hugely, difficult, complex problem.  And I would have hoped that we would have learned that from Afghanistan and Iraq, where we have devoted enormous time and effort and resources with the very best people and have given the Afghan people and the Iraqi people an opportunity for democracy.  But its still hard, as we saw this week in Afghanistan.  That's not by virtue of a lack of effort on our part, or a lack of commitment.  Weve still got 10,000 folks in Afghanistan.  We're still spending billions of dollar supporting that government, and its still tough. So when I make a decision about the level of military involvement that we're prepared to engage in, in Syria, I have to make a judgment based on, once we start something weve got to finish it, and weve got to do it well.  And do we, in fact, have the resources and the capacity to make a serious impact -- understanding that weve still got to go after ISIL in Iraq; we still have to support the training of an Iraqi military that is weaker than any of us perceived; that we still have business to do in Afghanistan.  And so I push -- and have consistently over the last four, five years sought out a wide range of opinions about steps that we can take potentially to move Syria in a better direction.  I am under no illusions about what an incredible humanitarian catastrophe this is, and the hardships that we're seeing, and the refugees that are traveling in very dangerous circumstances and now creating real political problems among our allies in Europe, and the heartbreaking images of children drowned trying to escape war, and the potential impact of such a destabilized country on our allies in the region.  But what we have learned over the last 10, 12, 13 years is that unless we can get the parties on the ground to agree to live together in some fashion, then no amount of U.S. military engagement will solve the problem.  And we will find ourselves either doing just a little bit and not making a difference, and losing credibility that way, or finding ourselves drawn in deeper and deeper into a situation that we can't sustain. And when I hear people offering up half-baked ideas as if they are solutions, or trying to downplay the challenges involved in this situation -- what Id like to see people ask is, specifically, precisely, what exactly would you do, and how would you fund it, and how would you sustain it?  And typically, what you get is a bunch of mumbo jumbo.  So these are hard challenges.  They are ones that we are going to continue to pursue.  The topline message that I want everybody to understand is we are going to continue to go after ISIL.  We are going to continue to reach out to a moderate opposition.  We reject Russias theory that everybody opposed to Assad is a terrorist.  We think that is self-defeating.  It will get them into a quagmire.  It will be used as a further recruitment tool for foreign fighters. We will work with the international community and our coalition to relieve the humanitarian pressure.  On refugees, we are working with the Turks and others to see what we can do along the border to make things safer for people.  But ultimately, we're going to have to find a way for a political transition if we're going to solve Syria. Jon Karl. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama:  Yes. Question:  Back in July you said that the gun issue has been the most frustrating of your presidency, and we certainly heard that frustration from you last night. President Obama:  Yes. Question:  So in the last 15 months of your presidency, do you intend to do anything differently to get Congress to act or to do something about this gun violence problem?  And I have to get you to respond to something that Jeb Bush just said, and to be fair to Governor Bush I want to read it directly.  Asked about the drive to take action in light of what happened in Oregon, he said, Look, stuff happens.  Theres always a crisis.  And the impulse is always to do something, and its not always the right thing to do.  How would you react to Governor Bush? President Obama:  I don't even think I have to react to that one.  I think the American people should hear that and make their own judgments, based on the fact that every couple of months, we have a mass shooting, and in terms of -- and they can decide whether they consider that stuff happening.  In terms of what I can do, Ive asked my team -- as I have in the past -- to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have to enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  Are there additional actions that we can take that might prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place?  But as I said last night, this will not change until the politics change and the behavior of elected officials changes. And so the main thing Im going to do is Im going to talk about this on a regular basis, and I will politicize it because our inaction is a political decision that we are making. The reason that Congress does not support even the modest gun safety laws that we proposed after Sandy Hook is not because the majority of the American people dont support it.  I mean, normally, politicians are responsive to the views of the electorate.  Here youve got the majority of the American people think its the right thing to do.  Background checks, other common-sense steps that would maybe save some lives couldnt even get a full vote.  And why is that?  Its because of politics.  Its because interest groups fund campaigns, feed people fear. And in fairness, its not just in the Republican Party -- although the Republican Party is just uniformly opposed to all gun safety laws.  And unless we change that political dynamic, were not going to be able to make a big dent in this problem. For example, youll hear people talk about the problem is not guns, its mental illness.  Well, if you talk to people who study this problem, it is true that the majority of these mass shooters are angry young men, but there are hundreds of millions of angry young men around the world -- tens of millions of angry young men.  Most of them dont shoot.  It doesnt help us just to identify -- and the majority of people who have mental illnesses are not shooters.  So we cant sort through and identify ahead of time who might take actions like this.  The only thing we can do is make sure that they cant have an entire arsenal when something snaps in them. And if were going to do something about that, the politics has to change.  The politics has to change.  And the people who are troubled by this have to be as intense and as organized and as adamant about this issue as folks on the other side who are absolutists and think that any gun safety measures are somehow an assault on freedom, or communistic -- or a plot by me to takeover and stay in power forever or something.  I mean, there are all kinds of crackpot conspiracy theories that float around there -- some of which, by the way, are ratified by elected officials in the other party on occasion. So weve got to change the politics of this.  And that requires people to feel -- not just feel deeply -- because I get a lot of letters after this happens -- do something!  Well, okay, heres what you need to do.  You have to make sure that anybody who you are voting for is on the right side of this issue.  And if theyre not, even if theyre great on other stuff, for a couple of election cycles youve got to vote against them, and let them know precisely why youre voting against them.  And you just have to, for a while, be a single-issue voter because thats what is happening on the other side.  And thats going to take some time.  I mean, the NRA has had a good start.  Theyve been at this a long time, theyve perfected what they do.  Youve got to give them credit -- theyre very effective, because they dont represent the majority of the American people but they know how to stir up fear; they know how to stir up their base; they know how to raise money; they know how to scare politicians; they know how to organize campaigns.  And the American people are going to have to match them in their sense of urgency if were actually going to stop this. Which isnt to say stopping all violence.  Were not going to stop all violence.  Violence exists around the world, sadly.  Part of original sin.  But our homicide rates are just a lot higher than other places -- that, by the way, have the same levels of violence.  Its just you cant kill as many people when you dont have easy access to these kinds of weapons.  And Im deeply saddened about what happened yesterday.  But Arne is going back to Chicago -- lets not forget, this is happening every single day in forgotten neighborhoods around the country.  Every single day.  Kids are just running for their lives, trying to get to school.  Broderick, when we were down in New Orleans, sitting down with a group of young men, when we were talking about Katrina, and Ive got two young men next to me, both of them had been shot multiple times.  They were barely 20.  So we got to make a decision.  If we think thats normal, then we have to own it.  I dont think its normal.  I think its abnormal.  I think we should change it.  But I cant do it by myself.  So the main thing Im going to do, Jon, is talk about it.  And hope that over time Im changing enough minds -- along with other leaders around the country -- that we start finally seeing some action.  I dont think its going to happen overnight. Cheryl Bolen. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  To go back to your opening remarks, you said that you wont sign another short-term CR.  But as you know, yesterday Secretary Lew announced that the governments borrowing authority would run out around November 5th.  Would you recommend negotiating an increase in the debt ceiling as part of these budget negotiations on spending caps?  And also does the Speakers race complicate these negotiations? President Obama:  Im sure the Speakers race complicates these negotiations.  That was a rhetorical question.  It will complicate the negotiations.  But when it comes to the debt ceiling, we're not going back there.  Maybe its been a while, so let me just refresh everybodys memory.  Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more, it simply authorizes us to pay the bills that we have already incurred.  It is the way for the United States to maintain its good credit rating -- the full faith and credit of the United States.  Historically, we do not mess with it.  If it gets messed with, it would have profound implications for the global economy and could put our financial system in the kind of tailspin that we saw back in 2007-2008.  Its just a bad thing to do.  So we're not going to negotiate on that.  It has to get done in the next five weeks.  So even though the continuing resolution to keep the government open lasts for 10 weeks, we have to get the debt ceiling raised in five.  You've got a shorter timetable to get that done. But heres the bottom line:  Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, myself, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid -- weve all spoken and talked about trying to negotiate a budget agreement.  And, yes, Speaker Boehners decision to step down complicates it.  But I do think that there is still a path for us to come up with a reasonable agreement that raises the spending caps above sequester to make sure that we can properly finance both our defense and nondefense needs, that maintains a prudent control of our deficits, and that we can do that in short order.  Its not that complicated.  The math is the math. And what Ive encouraged is that we get started on that work immediately, and we push through over the next several weeks -- and try to leave out extraneous issues that may prevent us from getting a budget agreement.  I know, for example, that there are many Republicans who are exercised about Planned Parenthood.  And I deeply disagree with them on that issue, and I think that its mischaracterized what Planned Parenthood does.  But I understand that they feel strongly about it, and I respect that.  But you can't have an issue like that potentially wreck the entire U.S. economy -- any more than I should hold the entire budget hostage to my desire to do something about gun violence.  I feel just as strongly about that and I think Ive got better evidence for it.  But the notion that I would threaten the Republicans that unless they passed gun safety measures that would stop mass shootings Im going to shut down the government and not sign an increase in the debt ceiling would be irresponsible of me.  And the American people, rightly, would reject that. Well, same is true for them.  There are some fights that we fight individually.  They want to defund Planned Parenthood, theres a way to do it.  Pass a law, override my veto.  That's true across a whole bunch of issues that they disagree with me on, and that's how democracy works.  I got no problem with that. But you have to govern.  And Im hoping that the next Speaker understands that the problem Speaker Boehner had or Mitch McConnell had in not dismantling Obamacare, or not eliminating the Department of Education, or not deporting every immigrant in this country was not because Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell didn't care about conservative principles.  It had to do with the fact that they can't do it in our system of government, which requires compromise.  Just like I can't do everything I want in passing an immigration bill, or passing a gun safety bill.  And that doesn't mean, then, I throw a tantrum and try to wreck the economy, and put hardworking Americans who are just now able to dig themselves out of a massive recession, put them in harms way.  Wrong thing to do. Peter Alexander. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You addressed -- I want to follow up on Jons questions about the issue thats obviously deeply personal and moving to you -- that is the gun issue.  Apart from Congresss inaction, apart from the desire for new laws and, beyond that, apart from the gun lobby, as you noted, the pattern is that these perpetrators are angry, aggrieved, oftentimes mentally ill young men.  Is there something that you can do with the bully pulpit, with your moral authority, with your remaining time in office to help reach these individuals who believe that gun violence is the way out?  President Obama:  No.  I think I can continue to speak to the American people as a whole and hopefully model for them basic social norms about rejecting violence, and cooperation and caring for other people.  But there are a lot of young men out there.  And having been one myself once, I can tell you that us being able to identify or pinpoint who might have problems is extraordinarily difficult.  So I think we, as a culture, should continuously think about how we can nurture our kids, protect our kids, talk to them about conflict resolution, discourage violence.  And I think there are poor communities where, rather than mass shootings, you're seeing just normal interactions that used to be settled by a fistfight settled with guns where maybe intervention programs and mentorship and things like that can work.  That's the kind of thing that we're trying to encourage through My Brothers Keeper. But when it comes to reaching every disaffected young man, 99 percent of -- or 99.9 percent of whom will hopefully grow out of it -- I don't think that theres a silver bullet there.  The way we are going to solve this problem is that when they act out, when they are disturbed, when that particular individual has a problem, that they can't easily access weapons that can perpetrate mass violence on a lot of people.  Because that's what other countries do.  Again, I want to emphasize this.  Theres no showing that somehow we are inherently more violent than any other advanced nation, or that young men are inherently more violent in our nation than they are in other nations.  I will say young men inherently are more violent than the rest of the population, but theres no sense that somehow this is -- its something in the American character that is creating this.  Levels of violence are on par between the United States and other advanced countries.  What is different is homicide rates and gun violence rates and mass shooting rates.  So its not that the behavior or the impulses are necessarily different as much as it is that they have access to more powerful weapons. Julia Edwards. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You just said that you reject President Putins approach to Syria and his attacks on moderate opposition forces.  You said it was a recipe for disaster.  But what are you willing to do to stop President Putin and protect moderate opposition fighters?  Would you consider imposing sanctions against Russia?  Would you go so far as to equip moderate rebels with anti-aircraft weapons to protect them from Russian air attacks?  And how do you respond to critics who say Putin is outsmarting you, that he took a measure of you in Ukraine and he felt he could get away with it? President Obama:  Yes, Ive heard it all before.  Ive got to say Im always struck by the degree to which not just critics but I think people buy this narrative.  Lets think about this.  So when I came into office seven and a half years ago, America had precipitated the worst financial crisis in history, dragged the entire world into a massive recession.  We were involved in two wars with almost no coalition support.  U.S. -- world opinion about the United States was at a nadir -- we were just barely above Russia at that time, and I think potentially slightly below Chinas.  And we were shedding 800,000 jobs a month, and so on and so forth.  And today, we're the strongest large advanced economy in the world -- probably one of the few bright spots in the world economy.  Our approval ratings have gone up.  We are more active on more international issues and forge international responses to everything from Ebola to countering ISIL.  Meanwhile, Mr. Putin comes into office at a time when the economy had been growing and they were trying to pivot to a more diversified economy, and as a consequence of these brilliant moves, their economy is contracting 4 percent this year.  They are isolated in the world community, subject to sanctions that are not just applied by us but by what used to be some of their closest trading partners.  Their main allies in the Middle East were Libya and Syria -- Mr. Gaddafi and Mr. Assad -- and those countries are falling apart.  And hes now just had to send in troops and aircraft in order to prop up this regime, at the risk of alienating the entire Sunni world.  So what was the question again? No, but I think its really interesting to understand.  Russia is not stronger as a consequence of what theyve been doing.  They get attention.  The sanctions against Ukraine are still in place.  And what Ive consistently offered -- from a position of strength, because the United States is not subject to sanctions and were not contracting 4 percent a year -- what Ive offered is a pathway whereby they can get back onto a path of growth and do right by their people.  So Mr. Putins actions have been successful only insofar as its boosted his poll ratings inside of Russia -- which may be why the beltway is so impressed, because that tends to be the measure of success.  Of course, its easier to do when youve got a state-controlled media.  But this is not a smart, strategic move on Russias part.  And what Russia has now done is not only committed its own troops into a situation in which the overwhelming majority of the Syrian population sees it now as an enemy, but the Sunni population throughout the Middle East is going to see it as a supporter, an endorser, of those barrel bombs landing on kids -- at a time when Russia has a significant Muslim population inside of its own borders that it needs to worry about. So I want Russia to be successful.  This is not a contest between the United States and Russia.  It is in our interest for Russia to be a responsible, effective actor on the international stage that can share burdens with us, along with China, along with Europe, along with Japan, along with other countries -- because the problems we have are big.  So Im hopeful that Mr. Putin, having made this doubling-down of the support he has provided to Mr. Assad, recognizes that this is not going to be a good long-term strategy and that he works instead to bring about a political settlement.  Just as I hope that they can resolve the issues with Ukraine in a way that recognizes Russian equities but upholds the basic principle of sovereignty and independence that the Ukrainian people should enjoy like everybody else.  But until that time, were going to continue to have tensions and were going to continue to have differences.  But were not going to make Syria into a proxy war between the United States and Russia.  That would be bad strategy on our part.  This is a battle between Russia, Iran, and Assad against the overwhelming majority of the Syrian people.  Our battle is with ISIL, and our battle is with the entire international community to resolve the conflict in a way that can end the bloodshed and end the refugee crisis, and allow people to be at home, work, grow food, shelter their children, send those kids to school.  Thats the side were on.  This is not some superpower chessboard contest.  And anybody who frames it in that way isnt paying very close attention to whats been happening on the chessboard. All right, last question.  Major Garrett. Question:  Mr. President, good to see you. President Obama:  Good to see you. Question:  And for the children there, I promise I wont take too long.  So youve been very patient. President Obama:  Ive been boring them to death, I guarantee it.  But there have been times where Ive snagged rebounds for Ryan when he is shooting three-pointers so he has got to put up with this. Question:  Understood.  Mr. President, I wonder if you could tell the country to what degree you were changed or moved by what you discussed in private with Pope Francis?  What do you think his visit might have meant for the country long term?  And for Democrats who might already be wondering, is it too late for Joe Biden to decide whether or not to run for President?  And lastly, just to clarify, to what degree did Hillary Clintons endorsement just yesterday of a no-fly zone put her in a category of embracing a half-baked answer on Syria that borders on mumbo jumbo? President Obama:  On the latter issue, on the last question that you asked, Hillary Clinton is not half-baked in terms of her approach to these problems.  She was obviously my Secretary of State.  But I also think that theres a difference between running for President and being President, and the decisions that are being made and the discussions that Im having with the Joint Chiefs become much more specific and require, I think, a different kind of judgment.  And thats what Ill continue to apply as long as Im here.  And if and when shes President, then shell make those judgments.  And shes been there enough that she knows that these are tough calls but that -- Question:  -- that she should know better?", "filename": "02October2015PresseronEducationSecretaryChangeEconomySyria.txt"}, {"question": "What does this mean?

There will be gaffes and minor controversies, be hot mics and Etch-a-Sketch moments.  You will cover every word that we say, and we will complain vociferously about the unflattering words that you write -- unless, of course, you're writing about the other guy -- in which case, good job. But there are also big, fundamental issues at stake right now -- issues that deserve serious debate among every candidate, and serious coverage among every reporter.  Whoever he may be, the next President will inherit an economy that is recovering, but not yet recovered, from the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression.  Too many Americans will still be looking for a job that pays enough to cover their bills or their mortgage.  Too many citizens will still lack the sort of financial security that started slipping away years before this recession hit.  A debt that has grown over the last decade, primarily as a result of two wars, two massive tax cuts, and an unprecedented financial crisis, will have to be paid down.  In the face of all these challenges, we're going to have to answer a central question as a nation:  What, if anything, can we do to restore a sense of security for people who are willing to work hard and act responsibly in this country?  Can we succeed as a country where a shrinking number of people do exceedingly well, while a growing number struggle to get by?  Or are we better off when everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules?", "filename": "03April2012SpeechatanAssociatedPressLuncheon.txt"}, {"question": "In this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few.  It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class.  Thats how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known.  Thats why a CEO like Henry Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so they could buy the cars that they made.  Thats why research has shown that countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run. And yet, for much of the last century, we have been having the same argument with folks who keep peddling some version of trickle-down economics.  They keep telling us that if wed convert more of our investments in education and research and health care into tax cuts -- especially for the wealthy -- our economy will grow stronger.  They keep telling us that if wed just strip away more regulations, and let businesses pollute more and treat workers and consumers with impunity, that somehow wed all be better off.  Were told that when the wealthy become even wealthier, and corporations are allowed to maximize their profits by whatever means necessary, its good for America, and that their success will automatically translate into more jobs and prosperity for everybody else.  Thats the theory. Now, the problem for advocates of this theory is that weve tried their approach -- on a massive scale.  The results of their experiment are there for all to see.  At the beginning of the last decade, the wealthiest Americans received a huge tax cut in 2001 and another huge tax cut in 2003.  We were promised that these tax cuts would lead to faster job growth.  They did not.  The wealthy got wealthier -- we would expect that.  The income of the top 1 percent has grown by more than 275 percent over the last few decades, to an average of $1.3 million a year.  But prosperity sure didn't trickle down. Instead, during the last decade, we had the slowest job growth in half a century.  And the typical American family actually saw their incomes fall by about 6 percent, even as the economy was growing. It was a period when insurance companies and mortgage lenders and financial institutions didnt have to abide by strong enough regulations, or they found their ways around them.  And what was the result?", "filename": "03April2012SpeechatanAssociatedPressLuncheon.txt"}, {"question": "So heres what this \"marvelous\" budget does.  Back in the summer, I came to an agreement with Republicans in Congress to cut roughly $1 trillion in annual spending.  Some of these cuts were about getting rid of waste; others were about programs that we support but just cant afford given our deficits and our debt.  And part of the agreement was a guarantee of another trillion in savings, for a total of about $2 trillion in deficit reduction. This new House Republican budget, however, breaks our bipartisan agreement and proposes massive new cuts in annual domestic spending -- exactly the area where weve already cut the most.  And I want to actually go through what it would mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly.  So bear with me.  I want to go through this -- because I dont think people fully appreciate the nature of this budget.   The year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each.  There would be 1,600 fewer medical grants, research grants for things like Alzheimers and cancer and AIDS.  There would be 4,000 fewer scientific research grants, eliminating support for 48,000 researchers, students, and teachers.  Investments in clean energy technologies that are helping us reduce our dependence on foreign oil would be cut by nearly a fifth. If this budget becomes law and the cuts were applied evenly, starting in 2014, over 200,000 children would lose their chance to get an early education in the Head Start Program.  Two million mothers and young children would be cut from a program that gives them access to healthy food.  There would be 4,500 fewer federal grants at the Department of Justice and the FBI to combat violent crime, financial crime, and help secure our borders.  Hundreds of national parks would be forced to close for part or all of the year.  We wouldnt have the capacity to enforce the laws that protect the air we breathe, the water we drink, or the food that we eat. Cuts to the FAA would likely result in more flight cancellations, delays, and the complete elimination of air traffic control services in parts of the country.  Over time, our weather forecasts would become less accurate because we wouldnt be able to afford to launch new satellites.  And that means governors and mayors would have to wait longer to order evacuations in the event of a hurricane. Thats just a partial sampling of the consequences of this budget.  Now, you can anticipate Republicans may say, well, well avoid some of these cuts -- since they dont specify exactly the cuts that they would make.  But they can only avoid some of these cuts if they cut even deeper in other areas.  This is math.  If they want to make smaller cuts to medical research that means theyve got to cut even deeper in funding for things like teaching and law enforcement.  The converse is true as well.  If they want to protect early childhood education, it will mean further reducing things like financial aid for young people trying to afford college. Perhaps they will never tell us where the knife will fall -- but you can be sure that with cuts this deep, there is no secret plan or formula that will be able to protect the investments we need to help our economy grow. This is not conjecture.  I am not exaggerating.  These are facts.  And these are just the cuts that would happen the year after next. If this budget became law, by the middle of the century, funding for the kinds of things I just mentioned would have to be cut by about 95 percent.  Let me repeat that.  Those categories I just mentioned we would have to cut by 95 percent.  As a practical matter, the federal budget would basically amount to whatever is left in entitlements, defense spending, and interest on the national debt -- period.  Money for these investments that have traditionally been supported on a bipartisan basis would be practically eliminated. And the same is true for other priorities like transportation, and homeland security, and veterans programs for the men and women who have risked their lives for this country.  This is not an exaggeration.  Check it out yourself. And this is to say nothing about what the budget does to health care.  Were told that Medicaid would simply be handed over to the states -- that's the pitch:  Let's get it out of the central bureaucracy.  The states can experiment.  They'll be able to run the programs a lot better.  But here's the deal the states would be getting.  They would have to be running these programs in the face of the largest cut to Medicaid that has ever been proposed -- a cut that, according to one nonpartisan group, would take away health care for about 19 million Americans -- 19 million. Who are these Americans?  Many are someones grandparents who, without Medicaid, won't be able to afford nursing home care without Medicaid.  Many are poor children.  Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or Downs Syndrome.  Some are kids with disabilities so severe that they require 24-hour care.  These are the people who count on Medicaid. Then theres Medicare.  Because health care costs keep rising and the Baby Boom generation is retiring, Medicare, we all know, is one of the biggest drivers of our long-term deficit.  Thats a challenge we have to meet by bringing down the cost of health care overall so that seniors and taxpayers can share in the savings. But heres the solution proposed by the Republicans in Washington, and embraced by most of their candidates for president:  Instead of being enrolled in Medicare when they turn 65, seniors who retire a decade from now would get a voucher that equals the cost of the second cheapest health care plan in their area.  If Medicare is more expensive than that private plan, theyll have to pay more if they want to enroll in traditional Medicare.  If health care costs rise faster than the amount of the voucher -- as, by the way, theyve been doing for decades -- thats too bad.  Seniors bear the risk.  If the voucher isnt enough to buy a private plan with the specific doctors and care that you need, that's too bad. So most experts will tell you the way this voucher plan encourages savings is not through better care at cheaper cost.  The way these private insurance companies save money is by designing and marketing plans to attract the youngest and healthiest seniors -- cherry-picking -- leaving the older and sicker seniors in traditional Medicare, where they have access to a wide range of doctors and guaranteed care.  But that, of course, makes the traditional Medicare program even more expensive, and raise premiums even further. The net result is that our country will end up spending more on health care, and the only reason the government will save any money -- it wont be on our books -- is because weve shifted it to seniors.  Theyll bear more of the costs themselves.  Its a bad idea, and it will ultimately end Medicare as we know it. Now, the proponents of this budget will tell us we have to make all these draconian cuts because our deficit is so large; this is an existential crisis, we have to think about future generations, so on and so on.  And that argument might have a shred of credibility were it not for their proposal to also spend $4.6 trillion over the next decade on lower tax rates. Were told that these tax cuts will supposedly be paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating wasteful deductions.  But the Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close.  Not one.  And by the way, there is no way to get even close to $4.6 trillion in savings without dramatically reducing all kinds of tax breaks that go to middle-class families -- tax breaks for health care, tax breaks for retirement, tax breaks for homeownership. Meanwhile, these proposed tax breaks would come on top of more than a trillion dollars in tax giveaways for people making more than $250,000 a year.  Thats an average of at least $150,000 for every millionaire in this country -- $150,000. Lets just step back for a second and look at what $150,000 pays for:  A years worth of prescription drug coverage for a senior citizen.  Plus a new school computer lab.  Plus a year of medical care for a returning veteran.  Plus a medical research grant for a chronic disease.  Plus a years salary for a firefighter or police officer.  Plus a tax credit to make a year of college more affordable.  Plus a years worth of financial aid.  One hundred fifty thousand dollars could pay for all of these things combined -- investments in education and research that are essential to economic growth that benefits all of us.  For $150,000, that would be going to each millionaire and billionaire in this country.  This budget says wed be better off as a country if thats how we spend it. This is supposed to be about paying down our deficit?  Its laughable. The bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission that I created -- which the Republicans originally were for until I was for it -- that was about paying down the deficit.  And I didnt agree with all the details.  I proposed about $600 billion more in revenue and $600 billion -- I'm sorry -- it proposed about $600 billion more in revenue and about $600 billion more in defense cuts than I proposed in my own budget.  But Bowles-Simpson was a serious, honest, balanced effort between Democrats and Republicans to bring down the deficit.  Thats why, although it differs in some ways, my budget takes a similarly balanced approach:  Cuts in discretionary spending, cuts in mandatory spending, increased revenue. This congressional Republican budget is something different altogether.  It is a Trojan Horse.  Disguised as deficit reduction plans, it is really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country.  It is thinly veiled social Darwinism.  It is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everybody whos willing to work for it; a place where prosperity doesnt trickle down from the top, but grows outward from the heart of the middle class.  And by gutting the very things we need to grow an economy thats built to last -- education and training, research and development, our infrastructure -- it is a prescription for decline. And everybody here should understand that because there's very few people here who haven't benefitted at some point from those investments that were made in the '50s and the '60s and the '70s and the '80s.  Thats part of how we got ahead.  And now, we're going to be pulling up those ladders up for the next generation? So in the months ahead, I will be fighting as hard as I know how for this truer vision of what the United States of America is all about.  Absolutely, we have to get serious about the deficit. And that will require tough choices and sacrifice.  And Ive already shown myself willing to make these tough choices when I signed into law the biggest spending cut of any President in recent memory.  In fact, if you adjust for the economy, the Congressional Budget Office says the overall spending next year will be lower than any year under Ronald Reagan. And Im willing to make more of those difficult spending decisions in the months ahead.  But Ive said it before and Ill say it again -- there has to be some balance.  All of us have to do our fair share. Ive also put forward a detailed plan that would reform and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid.  By the beginning of the next decade, it achieves the same amount of annual health savings as the plan proposed by Simpson-Bowles -- the Simpson-Bowles commission, and it does so by making changes that people in my party havent always been comfortable with.  But instead of saving money by shifting costs to seniors, like the congressional Republican plan proposes, our approach would lower the cost of health care throughout the entire system.  It goes after excessive subsidies to prescription drug companies.  It gets more efficiency out of Medicaid without gutting the program.  It asks the very wealthiest seniors to pay a little bit more.  It changes the way we pay for health care -- not by procedure or the number of days spent in a hospital, but with new incentives for doctors and hospitals to improve their results. And it slows the growth of Medicare costs by strengthening an independent commission -- a commission not made up of bureaucrats from government or insurance companies, but doctors and nurses and medical experts and consumers, who will look at all the evidence and recommend the best way to reduce unnecessary health care spending while protecting access to the care that the seniors need. We also have a much different approach when it comes to taxes -- an approach that says if were serious about paying down our debt, we cant afford to spend trillions more on tax cuts for folks like me, for wealthy Americans who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and that the country cannot afford. At a time when the share of national income flowing to the top 1 percent of people in this country has climbed to levels last seen in the 1920s, those same folks are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years.  As both I and Warren Buffett have pointed out many times now, hes paying a lower tax rate than his secretary.  That is not fair.  It is not right. And the choice is really very simple.  If you want to keep these tax rates and deductions in place -- or give even more tax breaks to the wealthy, as the Republicans in Congress propose -- then one of two things happen:  Either it means higher deficits, or it means more sacrifice from the middle class.  Seniors will have to pay more for Medicare.  College students will lose some of their financial aid.  Working families who are scraping by will have to do more because the richest Americans are doing less.  I repeat what Ive said before:  That is not class warfare, that is not class envy, that is math. If thats the choice that members of Congress want to make, then were going to make sure every American knows about it.  In a few weeks, there will be a vote on what weve called the Buffett Rule.  Simple concept:  If you make more than a million dollars a year -- not that you have a million dollars -- if you make more than a million dollars annually, then you should pay at least the same percentage of your income in taxes as middle-class families do.  On the other hand, if you make under $250,000 a year -- like 98 percent of American families do -- then your taxes shouldnt go up.  Thats the proposal. Now, youll hear some people point out that the Buffett Rule alone wont raise enough revenue to solve our deficit problems.  Maybe not, but its definitely a step in the right direction.  And I intend to keep fighting for this kind of balance and fairness until the other side starts listening, because I believe this is what the American people want.  I believe this is the best way to pay for the investments we need to grow our economy and strengthen the middle class.  And by the way, I believe its the right thing to do. This larger debate that we will be having and that you will be covering in the coming year about the size and role of government, this debate has been with us since our founding days. And during moments of great challenge and change, like the ones that were living through now, the debate gets sharper; it gets more vigorous.  Thats a good thing.  As a country that prizes both our individual freedom and our obligations to one another, this is one of the most important debates that we can have. But no matter what we argue or where we stand, we have always held certain beliefs as Americans.  We believe that in order to preserve our own freedoms and pursue our own happiness, we cant just think about ourselves.  We have to think about the country that made those liberties possible.  We have to think about our fellow citizens with whom we share a community.  We have to think about whats required to preserve the American Dream for future generations. And this sense of responsibility -- to each other and our country -- this isnt a partisan feeling.  This isnt a Democratic or Republican idea.  Its patriotism.  And if we keep that in mind, and uphold our obligations to one another and to this larger enterprise that is America, then I have no doubt that we will continue our long and prosperous journey as the greatest nation on Earth. Thank you.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America. Thank you. MR. [WILLIAM DEAN] SINGLETON:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We appreciate so much you being with us today.  I have some questions from the audience, which I will ask -- and I'll be more careful than I was last time I did this. Republicans have been sharply critical of your budget ideas as well.  What can you say to the Americans who just want both sides to stop fighting and get some work done on their behalf? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I completely understand the American peoples frustrations, because the truth is that these are eminently solvable problems.  I know that Christine Lagarde is here from the IMF, and shes looking at the books of a lot of other countries around the world.  The kinds of challenges they face fiscally are so much more severe than anything that we confront -- if we make some sensible decisions. So the American peoples impulses are absolutely right.  These are solvable problems if people of good faith came together and were willing to compromise.  The challenge we have right now is that we have on one side, a party that will brook no compromise.  And this is not just my assertion.  We had presidential candidates who stood on a stage and were asked, \"Would you accept a budget package, a deficit reduction plan, that involved $10 of cuts for every dollar in revenue increases?\" Ten-to-one ratio of spending cuts to revenue.  Not one of them raised their hand. Think about that.  Ronald Reagan, who, as I recall, is not accused of being a tax-and-spend socialist, understood repeatedly that when the deficit started to get out of control, that for him to make a deal he would have to propose both spending cuts and tax increases.  Did it multiple times.  He could not get through a Republican primary today. So let's look at Bowles-Simpson.  Essentially, my differences with Bowles-Simpson were I actually proposed less revenue and slightly lower defense spending cuts.  The Republicans want to increase defense spending and take in no revenue, which makes it impossible to balance the deficit under the terms that Bowles-Simpson laid out -- unless you essentially eliminate discretionary spending.  You don't just cut discretionary spending.  Everything we think of as being pretty important -- from education to basic science and research to transportation spending to national parks to environmental protection -- we'd essentially have to eliminate. I guess another way of thinking about this is -- and this bears on your reporting.  I think that there is oftentimes the impulse to suggest that if the two parties are disagreeing, then they're equally at fault and the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and an equivalence is presented -- which reinforces I think people's cynicism about Washington generally.  This is not one of those situations where there's an equivalence.  I've got some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress who were prepared to make significant changes to entitlements that go against their political interests, and who said they were willing to do it.  And we couldn't get a Republican to stand up and say, we'll raise some revenue, or even to suggest that we won't give more tax cuts to people who don't need them. And so I think it's important to put the current debate in some historical context.  It's not just true, by the way, of the budget.  It's true of a lot of the debates that we're having out here. Cap and trade was originally proposed by conservatives and Republicans as a market-based solution to solving environmental problems.  The first President to talk about cap and trade was George H.W. Bush.  Now you've got the other party essentially saying we shouldnt even be thinking about environmental protection; let's gut the EPA. Health care, which is in the news right now -- there's a reason why there's a little bit of confusion in the Republican primary about health care and the individual mandate since it originated as a conservative idea to preserve the private marketplace in health care while still assuring that everybody got covered, in contrast to a single-payer plan.  Now, suddenly, this is some socialist overreach. So as all of you are doing your reporting, I think it's important to remember that the positions I'm taking now on the budget and a host of other issues, if we had been having this discussion 20 years ago, or even 15 years ago, would have been considered squarely centrist positions.  What's changed is the center of the Republican Party.  And thats certainly true with the budget. MR. SINGLETON:  Mr. President, the managing director of the [inaudible] for continuation of United States leadership [inaudible] economic issues, and underscored the need for a lower deficit and lower debt.  How can you respond to that claim? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, look, she's absolutely right.  It's interesting, when I travel around the world at these international fora -- and I've said this before -- the degree to which America is still the one indispensable nation, the degree to which, even as other countries are rising and their economies are expanding, we are still looked to for leadership, for agenda setting -- not just because of our size, not just because of our military power, but because there is a sense that unlike most superpowers in the past, we try to set out a set of universal rules, a set of principles by which everybody can benefit. And thats true on the economic front as well.  We continue to be the worlds largest market, an important engine for economic growth.  We cant return to a time when by simply borrowing and consuming, we end up driving global economic growth. I said this a few months after I was elected at the first G20 summit.  I said the days when Americans using their credit cards and home equity loans finance the rest of the worlds growth by taking in imports from every place else -- those days are over.  On the other hand, we continue to be a extraordinarily important market and foundation for global economic growth. We do have to take care of our deficits.  I think Christine has spoken before, and I think most economists would argue as well, that the challenge when it comes to our deficits is not short-term discretionary spending, which is manageable.  As I said before and I want to repeat, as a percentage of our GDP, our discretionary spending -- all the things that the Republicans are proposing cutting -- is actually lower than it's been since Dwight Eisenhower.  There has not been some massive expansion of social programs, programs that help the poor, environmental programs, education programs.  Thats not our problem. Our problem is that our revenue has dropped down to between 15 and 16 percent -- far lower than it has been historically, certainly far lower than it was under Ronald Reagan -- at the same time as our health care costs have surged, and our demographics mean that there is more and more pressure being placed on financing our Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security programs. So at a time when the recovery is still gaining steam, and unemployment is still very high, the solution should be pretty apparent.  And that is even as we continue to make investments in growth today -- for example, putting some of our construction workers back to work rebuilding schools and roads and bridges, or helping states to rehire teachers at a time when schools are having a huge difficulty retaining quality teachers in the classroom -- all of which would benefit our economy, we focus on a long-term plan to stabilize our revenues at a responsible level and to deal with our health care programs in a responsible way.  And that's exactly what I'm proposing. And what we've proposed is let's go back, for folks who are making more than $250,000 a year, to levels that were in place during the Clinton era, when wealthy people were doing just fine, and the economy was growing a lot stronger than it did after they were cut.  And let's take on Medicare and Medicaid in a serious way -- which is not just a matter of taking those costs off the books, off the federal books, and pushing them onto individual seniors, but let's actually reduce health care costs.  Because we spend more on health care with not as good outcomes as any other advanced, developed nation on Earth. And that would seem to be a sensible proposal.  The problem right now is not the technical means to solve it.  The problem is our politics.  And that's part of what this election and what this debate will need to be about, is, are we, as a country, willing to get back to common-sense, balanced, fair solutions that encourage our long-term economic growth and stabilize our budget.  And it can be done. One last point I want to make, Dean, that I think is important, because it goes to the growth issue.  If state and local government hiring were basically on par to what our current recovery -- on par to past recoveries, the unemployment rate would probably be about a point lower than it is right now.  If the construction industry were going through what we normally go through, that would be another point lower.  The challenge we have right now -- part of the challenge we have in terms of growth has to do with the very specific issues of huge cuts in state and local government, and the housing market still recovering from this massive bubble.  And that -- those two things are huge headwinds in terms of growth. I say this because if we, for example, put some of those construction workers back to work, or we put some of those teachers back in the classroom, that could actually help create the kind of virtuous cycle that would bring in more revenues just because of economic growth, would benefit the private sector in significant ways.  And that could help contribute to deficit reduction in the short term, even as we still have to do these important changes to our health care programs over the long term. MR. SINGLETON:  Mr. President, you said yesterday that it would be unprecedented for a Supreme Court to overturn laws passed by an elected Congress.  But that is exactly what the Court has done during its entire existence.  If the Court were to overturn individual mandate, what would you do, or propose to do, for the 30 million people who wouldnt have health care after that ruling? THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let me be very specific. We have not seen a Court overturn a law that was passed by Congress on a economic issue, like health care, that I think most people would clearly consider commerce -- a law like that has not been overturned at least since Lochner.  Right?", "filename": "03April2012SpeechatanAssociatedPressLuncheon.txt"}, {"question": "I want to say thank you to the Denver Police for having me here, and more importantly, for the outstanding work that all of you do each and every day to serve your communities and protect your citizens. Before I came out here, I had a chance to sit down with some local law enforcement, Attorney General Holder, and some of the leaders I just mentioned, the wonderful mayor of Aurora whos here, sportsmen, parents, loved ones of the victims of the shootings in Columbine and Aurora.  And we talked about what we can do to protect more of our citizens from gun violence. And from the beginning of this effort, weve wanted law enforcement front and center in shaping this discussion and the reforms that emerge from it -- because law enforcement lives this every day.  Law enforcement are the first to see the terrible consequences of any kind of violence, certainly gun violence -- lives lost, families broken, communities that are changed forever.  Theyre very often in the line of fire.  The law enforcement knows what works and what doesnt, and so we wanted that experience and that advice. And it was also important for us to hear from mayors like Steve Hogan, because hes been on the front lines having to deal with these issues under incredibly sad circumstances.  And Ive come to Denver today in particular because Colorado is proving a model of whats possible. Its now been just over 100 days since the murder of 20 innocent children and six brave educators in Newtown, Connecticut -- an event that shocked this country and I think galvanized parents all across the country to say, weve got to do something more to protect our kids.  But consider this:  Over those 100 days or so, more than 100 times as many Americans have fallen victim to gun violence.  More than 2,000 of our fellow citizens, struck down, often because they were just going about their daily round.  They werent doing anything special.  Just doing what folks do every day -- shopping, going to school.  Every day that we wait to do something about it, even more of our fellow citizens are stolen from our lives by a bullet from a gun. Now, the good news is Colorado has already chosen to do something about it.  Look, this is a state that has suffered the tragedy of two of the worst mass shootings in our history -- 14 years ago this month in Columbine, and just last year in Aurora.  But this is also a state that treasures its Second Amendment rights -- the state of proud hunters and sportsmen.  And, by the way, the Governor wanted me to remind everybody that there is outstanding elk hunting here in Colorado.  Theres a strong tradition of gun ownership thats handed down from generation to generation, and its part of the fabric of peoples lives.  And they treat gun ownership with reverence and respect. And so Im here because I believe there doesn't have to be a conflict in reconciling these realities.  There doesnt have to be a conflict between protecting our citizens and protecting our Second Amendment rights.  Ive got stacks of letters in my office from proud gun owners, whether theyre for sport, or protection, or collection, who tell me how deeply they cherish their rights, dont want them infringed upon, but they still want us to do something to stop the epidemic of gun violence.  And I appreciate every one of those letters.  And Ive learned from them. And I think that Colorado has shown that practical progress is possible thanks to the leadership of Governor Hickenlooper and some of the state legislators who are here today.  When I was talking to Steve, he mentioned that Aurora is very much a purple city.  Its got a majority Republican city council; a majority of the state legislators are Democrat.  But they came together understanding that out of this tragedy there had to be something that made sense.  And so weve seen enacted tougher background checks that wont infringe on the rights of responsible gun owners, but will help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. Now, in January, just a few weeks after Newtown, I put forward a series of common-sense proposals along the same lines as whats passed here in Colorado, to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe.  In my State of the Union address, I urged Congress to give these proposals a vote.  And, by the way, before we even asked for a vote, I had already signed numerous executive orders doing what we could administratively to make sure that guns don't fall into the hands of the wrong people. But what I said then is still true:  If we're really going to tackle this problem seriously, then we've got to get Congress to take the next step.  And as soon as next week, they will be voting.  As soon as next week, every senator will get to vote on whether or not we should require background checks for anyone who wants to purchase a gun. Now, some say, well, we already have background checks.  And they're right.  Over the past 20 years, those background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from buying a gun.  But the loopholes that currently exist in the law have allowed way too many criminals and folks who shouldnt be getting guns -- it has allowed them to avoid background checks entirely.  That makes it harder for law enforcement to do its job.  It's not safe.  It's not smart.  And, by the way, it's not fair to responsible gun owners who are playing by the rules. Now, understand, nobody is talking about creating an entirely new system.  We are simply talking about plugging holes, sealing a porous system that isn't working as well as it should.  If you want to buy a gun, whether it's from a licensed dealer or a private seller, you should at least have to pass a background check to show you're not a criminal or someone legally prohibited from buying on.  And thats just common sense. During our roundtable discussion with Governor Hickenlooper, who I know was in the midst of this passionate debate about the legislation here in Colorado, and some people said, well, background checks aren't going to stop everybody.  And the Governor was the first one to acknowledge, yes, they won't stop everybody, but as he pointed out, statistically, there are a whole bunch of folks who have been stopped. As a consequence of background checks, law enforcement has been able to stop people who have been convicted of murder from getting a gun, people who are under restraining orders for having committed violent domestic abuse from getting a gun.  In a couple of cases the governor mentioned to me, law enforcement has actually been able to arrest people who came to pick up their gun -- because they were criminals, wanted. So this does work.  And, by the way, if youre selling a gun, wouldnt you want to know who youre selling it to?  Wouldnt you want to know?  Wouldnt you want in your conscience to know that the person youre selling to isnt going to commit a crime? So these enhanced background checks wont stop all gun crimes, but they will certainly help prevent some.  This is common sense.  And, by the way, most gun owners -- more than 80 percent -- agree this makes sense.  More than 70 percent of NRA members agree.  Ninety percent of the American people agree.  So theres no reason we cant do this unless politics is getting in the way.  Theres no reason we cant do this. As soon as next week, every senator will get a chance to vote on a proposal to help strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment that they need. As soon as next week, every senator will get to vote on whether or not we should crack down on folks who buy guns as part of a scheme to arm criminals.  That would keep more guns off the streets and out of the hands of people who are intent on doing harm.  And it would make life a whole lot easier and safer for the people behind me -- police officers. Every senator will get a say on whether or not we should keep weapons of war and high-capacity ammunition magazines that facilitate mass killings off our streets.  The type of assault rifle used in Aurora, for example, when paired with a high-capacity magazine, has one purpose:  to pump out as many bullets as possible, as fast as possible.  Its what allowed that gunman to shoot 70 people and kill 12 in a matter of a few minutes.  I dont believe that weapons designed for theaters of war have a place in movie theaters.  Most Americans agree with that. Most of these ideas are not controversial.  Right now, 90 percent of Americans -- 90 percent -- support background checks that will keep criminals and people who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others from buying a gun.  More than 80 percent of Republicans agree.  Most gun owners agree.  Think about it:  How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything? And yet, there are already some senators back in Washington floating the idea that they might use obscure procedural stunts to prevent or delay any of these votes on reform.  Think about that.  Theyre not just saying theyll vote no on the proposal that most Americans support.  Theyre saying theyll do everything they can to avoid even allowing a vote on a proposal that the overwhelming majority of the American people support.  Theyre saying your opinion doesnt matter. We knew from the beginning that change wouldnt be easy.  And we knew that there would be powerful voices that would do everything they could to run out the clock, change the subject, ignore the majority of the American people.  We knew theyd try to make any progress collapse under the weight of fear and frustration, or maybe people would just stop paying attention. The only way this time will be different is if the American people demand that this time it must be different -- that this time, we must do something to protect our communities and our kids.  We need parents, we need teachers, we need police officers, we need pastors, we need hunters and sportsmen, Americans of every background to say, weve suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue.  Were not going to just wait for the next Newtown or the next Aurora before we act.  And I genuinely believe thats what the overwhelming majority of Americans -- I dont care what party they belong to -- thats what they want.  They just want to see some progress. It was interesting, during the conversation, a number of people talked about the trust issue.  Part of the reason it's so hard to get this done is because both sides of the debate sometimes don't listen to each other.  The people who take absolute positions on these issues, on both sides, sometimes aren't willing to concede even an inch of ground. And so one of the questions we talked about was, how do you build trust?  How do you rebuild some trust?  And I told the story about two conversations I had.  The first conversation was when Michelle came back from doing some campaigning out in rural Iowa.  And we were sitting at dinner, and she had been to like a big county, a lot of driving out there, a lot of farmland.  And she said, if I was living out in a farm in Iowa, I'd probably want a gun, too.  If somebody just drives up into your driveway and you're not home -- you don't know who these people are and you don't know how long it's going to take for the sheriffs to respond.  I can see why you'd want some guns for protection.  That's one conversation. I had another conversation just a couple of months ago with a mom from Chicago -- actually, Evanston, Illinois -- whose son had been killed in a random shooting.  And she said, you know, I hate it when people tell me that my son was shot because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He was in the right place.  He was on his way to school.  He wasn't in the wrong place.  He was exactly where he was supposed to be. Now, both those things are true.  And sometimes we're so divided between rural and urban, and folks whose hunting is part of their lives and folks whose only experience with guns is street crime.  And the two sides just talk past one another.  And more than anything, what I want to just emphasize is there are good people on both sides of this thing, but we have to be able to put ourselves in the other person's shoes.  If you're a hunter, if you're a sportsman -- if you have a gun in your house for protection -- you've got to understand what it feels like for that mom whose son was randomly shot. And if you live in an urban area and you're worried about street crime, you've got to understand what it might be like if you grew out on a ranch and your dad had been taking you hunting all your life.  And we had a couple of sportsmen in our conversation today, and I thought one of them said something very important.  He said, all my experiences with guns have been positive, but I realize that for others, all their experiences about guns have been negative.  Well, that's a start, right?  If we start listening to each other, then we should be able to get something done that's constructive.  We should be able to get that done. One last thing Im going to mention is that during this conversation -- I hope you don't mind me quoting you, Joe.  Joe Garcia, I thought, also made an important point, and that is that the opponents of some of these common-sense laws have ginned up fears among responsible gun owners that have nothing to do with whats being proposed and nothing to do with the facts, but feeds into this suspicion about government. You hear some of these quotes:  I need a gun to protect myself from the government.  We can't do background checks because the government is going to come take my guns away. Well, the government is us.  These officials are elected by you.  They are elected by you.  I am elected by you.  I am constrained, as they are constrained, by a system that our Founders put in place.  Its a government of and by and for the people. And so, surely, we can have a debate that's not based on the notion somehow that your elected representatives are trying to do something to you other than potentially prevent another group of families from grieving the way the families of Aurora or Newtown or Columbine have grieved.  Weve got to get past some of the rhetoric that gets perpetuated that breaks down trust and is so over the top that it just shuts down all discussion.  And its important for all of us when we hear that kind of talk to say, hold on a second.  If there are any folks who are out there right now who are gun owners, and youve been hearing that somehow somebody is taking away your guns, get the facts.  Were not proposing a gun registration system, were proposing background checks for criminals. Don't just listen to what some advocates or folks who have an interest in this thing are saying.  Look at the actual legislation.  That's what happened here in Colorado.  And hopefully, if we know the facts and were listening to each other, then we can actually move forward. And thats what members of Congress need to hear from you.  Right now, members of Congress are at home in their districts.  Many of them are holding events where they can hear from their constituents.  So I'm asking anyone out there who is listening today, find out where your member of Congress stands on these issues.  If they're not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks, then ask them why not.  Why wouldnt you want to make it more difficult for a dangerous criminal to get his or her hands on a gun?  Why wouldnt you want to close the loophole that allows too many criminals to buy a gun without even the simplest of background checks?  Why on Earth wouldnt you want to make it easier rather than harder for law enforcement to do their job? I know that some of the officers here today know what it's like to look into the eyes of a parent or a grandparent, a brother or a sister, or a spouse who has just lost a loved one to an act of violence.  Some of those families, by the way, are here today.  And as police officers, you know as well as anybody, there is no magic solution to prevent every bad thing from happening in the world.  You still suit up, you put on your badge, put yourself at risk every single day.  Every single day, you go to work and you try to do the best you can to protect the people you're sworn to protect and serve.  Well, how can the rest of us as citizens do anything less? If there is just one step we can take to prevent more Americans from knowing the pain that some of the families who are here have known, dont we have an obligation to try?  Dont we have an obligation to try?  If these reforms keep one person from murdering dozens of innocent children or worshippers or moviegoers in a span of minutes, isn't it worth fighting for?", "filename": "03April2013GunViolenceReductionSpeechinColorado.txt"}, {"question": "Last week, Vice President-Elect Biden and I began the process of announcing our economic team. Today, we are pleased to name another key member of this team: our nominee for Secretary of Commerce, my great friend, Governor Bill Richardson. With each passing day, the work our team has begun, developing plans to revive our economy, becomes more urgent. Earlier this week, we learned that the U.S. economy has been in recession since December of 2007 and that our manufacturing output is at a 26 year low -- two stark reminders of the magnitude of the challenges we face. But while I know rebuilding our economy wont be easy -- and it wont be -- happen overnight -- I also know this: that right now, somewhere in America, a small business is at work with the next big idea; a scientist is on the cusp of the next big breakthrough discovery; an entrepreneur is sketching plans for the startup that will revolutionize an industry. Right now, across America, the finest products in the world are rolling off our assembly lines. And the proudest, most determined, most productive workers in the world are on the job -- some, already on their second shift of the day; many, putting in longer hours than ever before. After nearly two years of traveling across this country, meeting with workers, visiting businesses large and small, I am more confident than ever that we have everything we need to renew our economy. We've got the ingenuity, the technology, the skill, and commitment; we just need to put it to work. Its time to not just address the immediate economic threats, but to start laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity to help American businesses grow and thrive at home, and expand our efforts to promote American enterprise around the world. This work is the core mission of the Secretary of Commerce. And with his breadth and depth of experience in public life, Governor Richardson is uniquely suited for this role as a leading economic diplomat for America. During his time in state government and Congress, and in tour -- two tours of duty in the cabinet, Bill has seen from just about every angle what makes our economy work and what keeps it from working better. As Governor of New Mexico, Bill showed how government can act as a partner to support our businesses, helping to create 80,000 new jobs. And under his leadership, New Mexico saw the lowest unemployment rate in decades. As a former Secretary of Energy, Bill understands the steps we must take to build a new, clean-energy industry and create the green jobs of the twenty-first century --  jobs that pay well and wont be outsourced; jobs that will help us end our dependence on foreign oil. And as a former Ambassador to the United Nations, Bill brings both international stature and a deep understanding of todays global economy. He understands that the success of todays business in Detroit or Columbus often depends on whether it can sell products in places like Santiago or Shanghai. And he knows that Americas reputation in the world is critical not just to our security, but to our prosperity -- (excuse me) -- that when the citizens of the world respect Americas leadership, they are more likely to buy Americas products. To this crucial work of restoring Americas international standing, Bill will bring a leadership style all his own. Bill has never been content to just learn from briefing books, never satisfied with only the official version of the story. During his time in Congress, he held more than two -- 2,500 town-hall meetings, so he could hear directly from constituents. He was a regular in the U.N. cafeteria, mixing it up with U.N. employees over lunch. And during his 2002 campaign for record -- for Governor, he actually broke a world record by shaking nearly 14,000 hands in just eight hours. (I've got to check that statistic.) All of this reflects a determination to reach out and understand where people are coming from, what they hope for, and what he can do to help. This approach, I believe, has been the key to Bills success as a negotiator and will be key to his work on the critical functions of the Commerce Department -- from administering our census and monitoring our climate to protecting our intellectual property and restoring our economic diplomacy. In the end, Bill Richardson is a leader who shares my values, and he must -- and he will be measured his progress the same way I do. Are we creating good jobs instead of losing them? Are incomes growing instead of shrinking? I know Bill will be an unyielding advocate for American business and American jobs at home and around the world. And I look forward to working with him in the years ahead. In the end, Bill Richardson is a leader who shares my values, and he must -- and he will be measured his progress the same way I do.

I want to thank Muslim Americans leaders from across this city and this state, and some who traveled even from out of state to be here.  I want to recognize Congressman John Sarbanes, who is here.  As well as two other great leaders in Congress -- and proud Muslim Americans -- Congressman Keith Ellison from the great state of Minnesota -- and Congressman Andre Carson from the great state of Indiana. This mosque, like so many in our country, is an all-American story.  Youve been part of this city for nearly half a century. You serve thousands of families -- some whove lived here for decades as well as immigrants from many countries whove worked to become proud American citizens. Now, a lot of Americans have never visited a mosque.  To the folks watching this today who havent -- think of your own church, or synagogue, or temple, and a mosque like this will be very familiar.  This is where families come to worship and express their love for God and each other.  Theres a school where teachers open young minds.  Kids play baseball and football and basketball -- boys and girls -- I hear theyre pretty good.  Cub Scouts, Girl Scouts meet, recite the Pledge of Allegiance here. With interfaith dialogue, you build bridges of understanding with other faith communities -- Christians and Jews.  Theres a health clinic that serves the needy, regardless of their faith.  And members of this community are out in the broader community, working for social justice and urban development.  As voters, you come here to meet candidates.  As one of your members said, just look at the way we live...we are true Americans.\" So the first thing I want to say is two words that Muslim Americans dont hear often enough -- and that is, thank you.  Thank you for serving your community.  Thank you for lifting up the lives of your neighbors, and for helping keep us strong and united as one American family.  We are grateful for that. Now, this brings me to the other reason I wanted to come here today.  I know that in Muslim communities across our country, this is a time of concern and, frankly, a time of some fear.  Like all Americans, youre worried about the threat of terrorism.  But on top of that, as Muslim Americans, you also have another concern -- and that is your entire community so often is targeted or blamed for the violent acts of the very few. The Muslim American community remains relatively small --several million people in this country.  And as a result, most Americans dont necessarily know -- or at least don't know that they know -- a Muslim personally.  And as a result, many only hear about Muslims and Islam from the news after an act of terrorism, or in distorted media portrayals in TV or film, all of which gives this hugely distorted impression. And since 9/11, but more recently, since the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, youve seen too often people conflating the horrific acts of terrorism with the beliefs of an entire faith.  And of course, recently, weve heard inexcusable political rhetoric against Muslim Americans that has no place in our country. No surprise, then, that threats and harassment of Muslim Americans have surged.  Here at this mosque, twice last year, threats were made against your children.  Around the country, women wearing the hijab -- just like Sabah -- have been targeted. Weve seen children bullied.  Weve seen mosques vandalized.  Sikh Americans and others who are perceived to be Muslims have been targeted, as well. I just had a chance to meet with some extraordinary Muslim Americans from across the country who are doing all sorts of work.  Some of them are doctors; some of them are community leaders; religious leaders.  All of them were doing extraordinary work not just in the Muslim community but in the American community.  And theyre proud of their work in business and education, and on behalf of social justice and the environment and education.  I should point out they were all much younger than me -- which is happening more frequently these days.  And you couldnt help but be inspired, hearing about the extraordinary work that theyre doing.  But you also could not help but be heartbroken to hear their worries and their anxieties. Some of them are parents, and they talked about how their children were asking, are we going to be forced out of the country, or, are we going to be rounded up?  Why do people treat us like that?  Conversations that you shouldnt have to have with children -- not in this country.  Not at this moment. And thats an anxiety echoed in letters I get from Muslim Americans around the country.  Ive had people write to me and say, I feel like Im a second-class citizen.  Ive had mothers write and say, my heart cries every night,\" thinking about how her daughter might be treated at school.  A girl from Ohio, 13 years old, told me, Im scared.\"  A girl from Texas signed her letter a confused 14-year-old trying to find her place in the world.\" These are children just like mine.  And the notion that they would be filled with doubt and questioning their places in this great country of ours at a time when theyve got enough to worry about -- its hard being a teenager already -- thats not who we are. Were one American family.  And when any part of our family starts to feel separate or second-class or targeted, it tears at the very fabric of our nation. Its a challenge to our values -- and that means we have much work to do.  Weve got to tackle this head on.  We have to be honest and clear about it.   And we have to speak out.  This is a moment when, as Americans, we have to truly listen to each other and learn from each other.  And I believe it has to begin with a common understanding of some basic facts.  And I express these facts, although theyd be obvious to many of the people in this place, because, unfortunately, its not facts that are communicated on a regular basis through our media. So lets start with this fact:  For more than a thousand years, people have been drawn to Islams message of peace.  And the very word itself, Islam, comes from salam -- peace.  The standard greeting is as-salamu alaykum -- peace be upon you.  And like so many faiths, Islam is rooted in a commitment to compassion and mercy and justice and charity.  Whoever wants to enter paradise, the Prophet Muhammad taught, let him treat people the way he would love to be treated.\"  For Christians like myself, Im assuming that sounds familiar. The worlds 1.6 billion Muslims are as diverse as humanity itself.  They are Arabs and Africans.  They're from Latin America to Southeast Asia; Brazilians, Nigerians, Bangladeshis, Indonesians.  They are white and brown and black.  Theres a large African American Muslim community.  That diversity is represented here today.  A 14-year-old boy in Texas whos Muslim spoke for many when he wrote to me and said, We just want to live in peace.\" Heres another fact:  Islam has always been part of America. Starting in colonial times, many of the slaves brought here from Africa were Muslim.  And even in their bondage, some kept their faith alive.  A few even won their freedom and became known to many Americans.  And when enshrining the freedom of religion in our Constitution and our Bill of Rights, our Founders meant what they said when they said it applied to all religions. Back then, Muslims were often called Mahometans.  And Thomas Jefferson explained that the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom he wrote was designed to protect all faiths -- and Im quoting Thomas Jefferson now -- the Jew and the Gentile, the Christian and the Mahometan.\" Jefferson and John Adams had their own copies of the Quran. Benjamin Franklin wrote that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.\"   So this is not a new thing. Generations of Muslim Americans helped to build our nation. They were part of the flow of immigrants who became farmers and merchants.  They built Americas first mosque, surprisingly enough, in North Dakota.    Americas oldest surviving mosque is in Iowa.  The first Islamic center in New York City was built in the 1890s.  Muslim Americans worked on Henry Fords assembly line, cranking out cars.  A Muslim American designed the skyscrapers of Chicago. In 1957, when dedicating the Islamic center in Washington, D.C., President Eisenhower said, I should like to assure you, my Islamic friends, that under the American Constitution...and in American hearts...this place of worship, is just as welcome...as any other religion.\" And perhaps the most pertinent fact, Muslim Americans enrich our lives today in every way.  Theyre our neighbors, the teachers who inspire our children, the doctors who trust us with our health -- future doctors like Sabah.  Theyre scientists who win Nobel Prizes, young entrepreneurs who are creating new technologies that we use all the time.  Theyre the sports heroes we cheer for - like Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Hakeem Olajuwon.  And by the way, when Team USA marches into the next Olympics, one of the Americans waving the red, white and blue -- will a fencing champion, wearing her hijab, Ibtihaj Muhammad, who is here today.  Stand up.  I told her to bring home the gold.  Not to put any pressure on you. Muslim Americans keep us safe.  Theyre our police and our firefighters.  They're in homeland security, in our intelligence community.  They serve honorably in our armed forces -- meaning they fight and bleed and die for our freedom.  Some rest in Arlington National Cemetery. So Muslim Americans are some of the most resilient and patriotic Americans youll ever meet.  Were honored to have some of our proud Muslim American servicemembers here today.  Please stand if you're here, so we can thank you for your service. So part of the reason I want to lay out these facts is because, in the discussions that I was having with these incredibly accomplished young people, they were pointing that so often they felt invisible.  And part of what we have to do is to lift up the contributions of the Muslim American community not when theres a problem, but all the time. Our television shows should have some Muslim characters that are unrelated to national security -- because -- its not that hard to do.  There was a time when there were no black people on television.  And you can tell good stories while still representing the reality of our communities. Now, we do have another fact that we have to acknowledge.  Even as the overwhelming majority -- and I repeat, the overwhelming majority -- of the worlds Muslims embrace Islam as a source of peace, it is undeniable that a small fraction of Muslims propagate a perverted interpretation of Islam.  This is the truth. Groups like al Qaeda and ISIL, theyre not the first extremists in history to misuse Gods name.  Weve seen it before, across faiths.  But right now, there is a organized extremist element that draws selectively from Islamic texts, twists them in an attempt to justify their killing and their terror.  They combine it with false claims that America and the West are at war with Islam.  And this warped thinking that has found adherents around the world -- including, as we saw, tragically, in Boston and Chattanooga and San Bernardino -- is real.  Its there.  And it creates tensions and pressure that disproportionately burden the overwhelming majority of law-abiding Muslim citizens. And the question then is, how do we move forward together?  How do we keep our country strong and united?  How do we defend ourselves against organizations that are bent on killing innocents?  And it cant be the work of any one faith alone.  It cant be just a burden on the Muslim community -- although the Muslim community has to play a role.  We all have responsibilities.  So with the time I have left, I just want to suggest a few principles that I believe can guide us. First, at a time when others are trying to divide us along lines of religion or sect, we have to reaffirm that most fundamental of truths:  We are all Gods children.  Were all born equal, with inherent dignity. And so often, we focus on our outward differences and we forget how much we share.  Christians, Jews, Muslims -- were all, under our faiths, descendants of Abraham.  So mere tolerance of different religions is not enough.  Our faiths summon us to embrace our common humanity.  O mankind,\" the Quran teaches, we have made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.\"  So all of us have the task of expressing our religious faith in a way that seeks to build bridges rather than to divide. Second, as Americans, we have to stay true to our core values, and that includes freedom of religion for all faiths.  I already mentioned our Founders, like Jefferson, knew that religious liberty is essential not only to protect religion but because religion helps strengthen our nation -- if it is free, if it is not an extension of the state.  Part of whats happened in the Middle East and North Africa and other places where we see sectarian violence is religion being a tool for another agenda -- for power, for control.  Freedom of religion helps prevent that, both ways -- protects religious faiths, protects the state from  -- or those who want to take over the state from using religious animosity as a tool for their own ends. That doesnt mean that those of us with religious faith should not be involved.  We have to be active citizenry.  But we have to respect the fact that we have freedom of religion. Remember, many preachers and pastors fought to abolish the evil of slavery.  People of faith advocated to improve conditions for workers and ban child labor.  Dr. King was joined by people of many faiths, challenging us to live up to our ideals.  And that civil activism, that civic participation thats the essence of our democracy, it is enhanced by freedom of religion. Now, we have to acknowledge that there have been times where we have fallen short of our ideals.  By the way, Thomas Jeffersons opponents tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim -- so I was not the first --  No, its true, its true.  Look it up.    Im in good company. But it hasnt just been attacks of that sort that have been used.  Mormon communities have been attacked throughout our history.  Catholics, including, most prominently, JFK -- John F. Kennedy -- when he ran for President, was accused of being disloyal.  There was a suggestion that he would be taking orders from the Pope as opposed to upholding his constitutional duties. Anti-Semitism in this country has a sad and long history, and Jews were exclude routinely from colleges and professions and from public office. And so if were serious about freedom of religion -- and Im speaking now to my fellow Christians who remain the majority in this country -- we have to understand an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths.   And when any religious group is targeted, we all have a responsibility to speak up.  And we have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias, and targets people because of religion. Weve got to make sure that hate crimes are punished, and that the civil rights of all Americans are upheld.   And just as faith leaders, including Muslims, must speak out when Christians are persecuted around the world -- or when anti-Semitism is on the rise -- because the fact is, is that there are Christians who are targeted now in the Middle East, despite having been there for centuries, and there are Jews whove lived in places like France for centuries who now feel obliged to leave because they feel themselves under assault --sometimes by Muslims.  We have to be consistent in condemning hateful rhetoric and violence against everyone.   And that includes against Muslims here in the United States of America. So none of us can be silent.  We cant be bystanders to bigotry.  And together, weve got to show that America truly protects all faiths. Which brings me to my next point:  As we protect our country from terrorism, we should not reinforce the ideas and the rhetoric of the terrorists themselves.  I often hear it said that we need moral clarity in this fight.  And the suggestion is somehow that if I would simply say, these are all Islamic terrorists, then we would actually have solved the problem by now, apparently.    Well, I agree, we actually do need moral clarity.  Lets have some moral clarity. Groups like ISIL are desperate for legitimacy.  They try to portray themselves as religious leaders and holy warriors who speak for Islam.  I refuse to give them legitimacy.  We must never give them that legitimacy.  Theyre not defending Islam.  Theyre not defending Muslims.  The vast majority of the people they kill are innocent Muslim men, women and children. And, by the way, the notion that America is at war with Islam ignores the fact that the worlds religions are a part of who we are.  We cant be at war with any other religion because the worlds religions are a part of the very fabric of the United States, our national character. So the best way for us to fight terrorism is to deny these organizations legitimacy and to show that here in the United States of America, we do not suppress Islam; we celebrate and lift up the success of Muslim Americans.  Thats how we show the lie that theyre trying to propagate.   We shouldnt play into terrorist propaganda.  And we cant suggest that Islam itself is at the root of the problem.  That betrays our values.  It alienates Muslim Americans.  Its hurtful to those kids who are trying to go to school and are members of the Boy Scouts, and are thinking about joining our military. That kind of mindset helps our enemies.  It helps our enemies recruit.  It makes us all less safe.  So lets be clear about that. Now, finally, just as all Americans have a responsibility to reject discrimination -- Ive said this before -- Muslims around the world have a responsibility to reject extremist ideologies that are trying to penetrate within Muslim communities. Here at this mosque, and across our country and around the world, Muslim leaders are roundly and repeatedly and consistently condemning terrorism.  And around the globe, Muslims whove dared to speak out have often been targeted and even killed.  So those voices are there; we just have to amplify them more. And it was interesting, in the discussion I had before I came out, some people said, why is there always a burden on us?", "filename": "03February2016IslamicSocietyofBaltimoreSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. Please have a seat, have a seat.  Before I get started, can we get the new presidential setup out here?  It's worked before. That's more like it. It is great to be back.  What a year, huh?  I usually start these dinners with a few self-deprecating jokes.  After my stellar 2013, what could I possibly talk about? I admit it -- last year was rough.  Sheesh.  At one point things got so bad, the 47 percent called Mitt Romney to apologize. Of course, we rolled out healthcare.gov.  That could have gone better.  In 2008 my slogan was, \"Yes We Can.\"  In 2013 my slogan was, \"Control-Alt-Delete.\"  On the plus side, they did turn the launch of healthcare.gov into one of the year's biggest movies. But rather than dwell on the past, I would like to pivot to this dinner.  Let's welcome our headliner this evening, Joel McHale. On \"Community,\" Joel plays a preening, self-obsessed narcissist.  So this dinner must be a real change of pace for you. I want to thank the White House Correspondents Association for hosting us here tonight.  I am happy to be here, even though I am a little jet-lagged from my trip to Malaysia.  The lengths we have to go to get CNN coverage these days. I think they're still searching for their table. MSNBC is here.  They're a little overwhelmed.  They've never seen an audience this big before. But, look, everybody is trying to keep up with this incredibly fast-changing media landscape.  For example, I got a lot of grief on cable news for promoting Obamacare to young people on Between Two Ferns.  But that's what young people like to watch.  And to be fair, I am not the first person on television between two potted plants. Sometimes I do feel disrespected by you reporters.  But that's okay.  Seattle Seahawk cornerback Richard Sherman is here tonight.  And he gave me some great tips on how to handle it.  Jake Tapper, don't you ever talk about me like that!1 I'm the best President in the game! What do you think, Richard?  Was that good?  A little more feeling next time? While we're talking sports, just last month, a wonderful story -- an American won the Boston Marathon for first time in 30 years.  Which was inspiring and only fair, since a Kenyan has been president for the last six. Had to even things out. We have some other athletes here tonight, including Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Jamie Anderson is here.  We're proud of her.  Incredibly talented young lady.  Michelle and I watched the Olympics -- we cannot believe what these folks do -- death-defying feats -- haven't seen somebody pull a \"180\" that fast since Rand Paul disinvited that Nevada rancher from this dinner.  As a general rule, things don't like end well if the sentence starts, Let me tell you something \"I know about the negro.\"2  You don't really need to hear the rest of it.  Just a tip for you -- don't start your sentence that way. Speaking of Rand Paul -- Colorado legalized marijuana this year, an interesting social experiment.  I do hope it doesn't lead to a whole lot of paranoid people who think that the federal government is out to get them and listening to their phone calls.  That would be a problem. And speaking of conservative heroes, the Koch brothers bought a table here tonight.  But as usual, they used a shadowy right-wing organization as a front.  Hello, Fox News. I'm just kidding.  Let's face it, Fox, you'll miss me when I'm gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya. A lot of us really are concerned about the way big money is influencing our politics.  I remember when a Super PAC was just me buying Marlboro 100s instead of regulars. Of course, now that it's 2014, Washington is obsessed on the midterms.  Folks are saying that with my sagging poll numbers, my fellow Democrats don't really want me campaigning with them.  And I don't think that's true -- although I did notice the other day that Sasha needed a speaker at career day, and she invited Bill Clinton. I was a little hurt by that. Both sides are doing whatever it takes to win the ruthless game.  Republicans -- this is a true story -- Republicans actually brought in a group of consultants to teach their candidates how to speak to women.  This is true.  And I don't know if it will work with women, but I understand that America's teenage boys are signing up to run for the Senate in droves. Anyway, while you guys focus on the horserace, I'm going to do what I do -- I'm going to be focused on everyday Americans.  Just yesterday, I read a heartbreaking letter -- you know I get letters from folks from around the country; every day I get 10 that I read -- this one got to me.  A Virginia man who's been stuck in the same part-time job for years; no respect from his boss; no chance to get ahead.  I really wish Eric Cantor would stop writing me. You can just pick up the phone, Eric. And I'm feeling sorry -- believe it or not -- for the Speaker of the House, as well.  These days, the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give me, which means orange really is the new black. But I have not given up the idea of working with Congress. In fact, two weeks ago, Senator Ted Cruz and I, we got a bill done together.  And I have to say, the signing ceremony was something special.  We've got a picture of it I think. Look, I know, Washington seems more dysfunctional than ever.  Gridlock has gotten so bad in this town you have to wonder:  What did we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad? One issue, for example, we haven't been able to agree on is unemployment insurance.  Republicans continue to refuse to extend it.  And you know what, I am beginning to think they've got a point.  If you want to get paid while not working, you should have to run for Congress just like everybody else. Of course, there is one thing that keeps Republicans busy.  They have tried more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare.  Despite that, 8 million people signed up for health care in the first open enrollment. Which does lead one to ask, How well does Obamacare have to work before you don't want to repeal it?  What if everybody's cholesterol drops to 120?  What if your yearly checkup came with tickets to a Clippers game?  Not the old, Donald Sterling Clippers -- the new Oprah Clippers.  Would that be good enough? What if they gave Mitch McConnell a pulse?  What is it going to take? Anyway, this year, I've promised to use more executive actions to get things done without Congress.  My critics call this the \"imperial presidency.\"  The truth is, I just show up every day in my office and do my job.  I've got a picture of this, I think.  You would think they'd appreciate a more assertive approach, considering that the new conservative darling is none other than Vladimir Putin.  Last year, Pat Buchanan said Putin is \"headed straight for the Nobel Peace Prize.\"3  He said this.  Now I know it sounds crazy but to be fair, they give those to just about anybody these days.  So it could happen. But it's not just Pat -- Rudy Giuliani said Putin is \"what you call a leader.\"  Mike Huckabee and Sean Hannity keep talking about his bare chest, which is kind of weird.  Look it up -- they talk about it a lot. It is strange to think that I have just two and a half years left in this office.  Everywhere I look, there are reminders that I only hold this job temporarily. But it's a long time between now and 2016, and anything can happen.  You may have heard the other day, Hillary had to dodge a flying shoe at a press conference.  I love that picture. Regardless of what happens, I've run my last campaign and I'm beginning to think about my legacy.  Some of you know -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently announced he is naming a high school in Chicago after me, which is extremely humbling.  I was even more flattered to hear Rick Perry, who is here tonight, is doing the same thing in Texas.  Take a look. Thank you, Rick.  It means a lot to me. And I intend to enjoy all the free time that I will have.  George W. Bush took up painting after he left office, which inspired me to take up my own artistic side.  I'm sure we've got a shot of this. Maybe not.  The joke doesn't work without the slide.  Oh well.  Assume that it was funny. Does this happen to you, Joel?  It does?  Okay. On a more serious note, tonight reminds us that we really are lucky to live in a country where reporters get to give a head of state a hard time on a daily basis -- and then, once a year, give him or her the chance, at least, to try to return the favor. But we also know that not every journalist, or photographer, or crewmember is so fortunate, because even as we celebrate the free press tonight, our thoughts are with those in places around the globe like Ukraine, and Afghanistan, and Syria, and Egypt, who risk everything -- in some cases, even give their lives -- to report the news.  And what tonight also reminds us is that the fight for full and fair access goes beyond the chance to ask a question.  As Steve mentioned, decades ago, an African American who wanted to cover his or her President might be barred from journalism school, burdened by Jim Crow, and, once in Washington, banned from press conferences.  But after years of effort, black editors and publishers began meeting with FDR's press secretary, Steve Early.  And then they met with the President himself, who declared that a black reporter would get a credential.  And even when Harry McAlpin made history as the first African American to attend a presidential news conference, he wasn't always welcomed by the other reporters.  But he was welcomed by the President, who told him, I'm glad to see you, McAlpin, and I'm very happy to have you here. Now, that sentiment might have worn off once Harry asked him a question or two -- and Harry's battles continued.  But he made history.  And we're s proud of Sherman and his family for being here tonight, and the White House Correspondents Association for creating a scholarship in Harry's name. For over 100 years, even as the White House Correspondents Association has told the story of America's progress, you've lived it, too -- gradually allowing equal access to women, and minorities, and gays, and Americans with disabilities.  And, yes, radio, and television, and Internet reporters, as well.  And through it all, you've helped make sure that even as societies change, our fundamental commitment to the interaction between those who govern and those who ask questions doesn't change.  And as Jay will attest, it's a legacy you carry on enthusiastically  every single day. And because this is the 100th anniversary of the Correspondents' Association, I actually recorded an additional brief video thanking all of you for your hard work.  Can we run the video? And because this is the 100th anniversary of the Correspondents' Association, I actually recorded an additional brief video thanking all of you for your hard work.  Can we run the video? President Obama:  What's going on?  I was told this would work.  Does anybody know how to fix this? President Obama:  What's going on?  I was told this would work.  Does anybody know how to fix this? President Obama:  Oh, thank you.  You got it?", "filename": "03May2014WhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinnerSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "I'm Jim Lehrer of the \"PBS NewsHour,\" and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 Presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee. This debate and the next three -- two Presidential, one vice Presidential -- are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight's 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment. Thousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates. The segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent -- no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney. Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Let's start the economy, segment one, and let's begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs? You have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first. President Obama: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality. There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me. And so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people. You know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression: millions of jobs were lost; the auto industry was on the brink of collapse; the financial system had frozen up. And because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we've begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise. But we all know that we've still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we've been, but where we're going. Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we'll be better off. I've got a different view. I think we've got to invest in education and training. I think it's important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we're helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we're saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments. Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters -- to you -- which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I'm looking forward to having that debate. LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes. Governor Romney: Thank you, Jim. It's an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the President. I'm pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates. And congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I'm sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here -- here with me. So I...Congratulations. This is obviously a very tender topic. I've had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \"I've been out of work since May. Can you help me?\" Ann yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \"Ann, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He's lost his most recent job and we've now just lost our home. Can you help us?\" And the answer is, yes, we can help, but it's going to take a different path. Not the one we've been on, not the one the President describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That's not what I'm going to do. My plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat. Number three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We're far away from that now. Number four, get to us a balanced budget. Number five, champion small business. It's small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low. Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're on has just been unsuccessful. The President has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more -- if you will, trickle-down government -- would work. That's not the right answer for America. I'll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down -- his trick-down approach, as he said yours is. President Obama: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we've got to improve our education system and we've made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We've got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers. So now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people. When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States. On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we've got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they've been in years. But I also believe that we've got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments. So all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments? And this is where there's a difference, because Governor Romney's central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut -- on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts -- that's another trillion dollars -- and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn't asked for. That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we're going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can. But, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you'd like to ask the President directly about something he just said? Governor Romney: Well, sure. I'd like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece. First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don't have a tax cut of a scale that you're talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I'm not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They'll do fine whether you're President or I am. The people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the President's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They're just being crushed. Middle-income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a -- this is a tax in and of itself. I'll call it the economy tax. It's been crushing. At the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the President. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed. And so the question is how to get them going again. And I've described it. It's energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the -- the cornerstones of my plan. But the President mentioned a couple of other ideas I'll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we've got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We've got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them. The second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth. The third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the President pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies. Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I'm President, I'll double them, and also get the -- the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring that pipeline in from Canada. And, by the way, I like coal. I'm going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it's getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs. And finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the -- the revenues going to the government. My -- my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I -- and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any -- any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President? President Obama: Well, I think -- let's talk about taxes, because I think it's instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that's exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600. And the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who's going off to college, which means they're spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers. Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them. But I'm going to make an important point here, Jim. LEHRER: All right. President Obama: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can -- are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don't come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending. And that's why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the deficit or -- or -- or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more. Now, that's not my analysis. That's the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And -- and that kind of top -- top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that's not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth. LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let's just stay on taxes. Just -- let's just stay on taxes for [inaudible]. What is the difference... Governor Romney: Well, but -- but virtually -- virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate. So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan. Number two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it's a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it's just not the case. Look, I've got five boys. I'm used to people saying something that's not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I'll believe it. But that -- that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans. And number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you're going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families. There are all these studies out there. But let's get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you'd think, well, then why lower the rates? And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people. LEHRER: That's where we started. Yeah. Do you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan? President Obama: Well, for 18 months he's been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he's saying that his big, bold idea is, \"Never mind.\" And the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It's -- it's math. It's arithmetic. Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates -- the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families. But I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was President, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot. And the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we're also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy. And we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under -- under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they're the job creators, they'd be burdened. But under Governor Romney's definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn't like to think of himself as small anything, but -- but that's how you define small businesses if you're getting business income. And that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake. LEHRER: All right. Governor Romney: Jim, let me just come back on that -- on that point, which is these... LEHRER: Just for the -- just for record... Governor Romney: ... the small businesses we're talking about... LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we're way over our first 15 minutes. Governor Romney: It's fun, isn't it? LEHRER: It's OK, it's great. No problem. Well, you all don't have -- you don't have a problem, I don't have a problem, because we're still on the economy. We're going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too. OK, but go ahead, sir. Governor Romney: You bet. Well, President, you're -- Mr. President, you're absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not -- not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they're taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half -- half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent. Now, and -- and I've talked to a guy who has a very small business. He's in the electronics business in -- in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there's nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That's by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced. President Obama: Jim, I -- you may want to move onto another topic, but I -- I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion -- just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that's more than our entire defense budget -- and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's plan may work for you. But I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that's not a recipe for job growth. Look, we've tried this. We've tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney's talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we've got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they've got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit. ROMNEY: Jim, the President began this segment, so I think I get the last word. LEHRER: Well, you're going to get the first word in the next segment. ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word [inaudible]. I hope. Let me just make this comment. I think first of all, let me -- let me repeat -- let me repeat what I said. I'm not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That's point one. So you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's not my plan. Number two, let's look at history. My plan is not like anything that's been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working. My priority is putting people back to work in America. They're suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It's absolutely extraordinary. We've got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It's just -- it's -- we've got -- when the President took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before. Going forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today. LEHRER: All right. Let's talk -- we're still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt. And the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you -- you go first because the President went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country? Governor Romney: Good. I'm glad you raised that, and it's a -- it's a critical issue. I think it's not just an economic issue, I think it's a moral issue. I think it's, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they're going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives. And the amount of debt we're adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral. So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they're paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way. The President would -- President would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time. What things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don't pass it: Is the program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I'll get rid of it. Obamacare's on my list. I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way. President Obama: I like it. Governor Romney: Good. OK, good. So I'll get rid of that. I'm sorry, Jim, I'm going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That's number one. Number two, I'll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state. Number three, I'll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way. This is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget. The President said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The President's put it in place as much public debt -- almost as much debt held by the public as al prior Presidents combined. LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes. President Obama: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis. And despite that, what we've said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression, but what we've also said is, let's make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow. So 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren't working very well, 18 government -- 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren't helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system. And I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That's the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower. Now, we all know that we've got to do more. And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It's on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how the commission -- bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have. Let -- let me just finish their point, because you're looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no. Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney...talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities. LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry. President Obama: And -- and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward. LEHRER: Way over the two minutes. President Obama: Sorry. LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles? Governor Romney: Simpson-Bowles, the President should have grabbed that. LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles? Governor Romney: I have my own plan. It's not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the President should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it. President Obama: That's what we've done, made some adjustments to it, and we're putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan... Governor Romney: But you've been -- but you've been President four years...You've been President four years. You said you'd cut the deficit in half. It's now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you're re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar debt. I mean, you have said before you'd cut the deficit in half. And this -- I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn't get the job done. Let me come back and say, why is it that I don't want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \"Look, I'm going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we're in recession, you shouldn't raise taxes on anyone.\" Well, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don't want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it's not just wealthy people -- you mentioned Donald Trump. It's not just Donald Trump you're taxing. It's all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill jobs. That's why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs in this environment. I'll make one more point. LEHRER: [inaudible] answer the taxes thing for a moment. Governor Romney: OK. LEHRER: Mr. President? President Obama: Well, we've had this discussion before. LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts. President Obama: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He's ruled out revenue. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: Absolutely. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you'll never get there. You'll never balance the budget by raising taxes. Spain -- Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We're now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don't want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they're working. LEHRER: But -- but Mr. President, you're saying in order to -- to get the job done, it's got to be balanced. You've got to have... [Crosstalk] President Obama: If -- if we're serious, we've got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let's talk about corporate taxes. Now, I've identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy. The oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn't we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it. When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions -- he hasn't identified which ones they are -- but that thereby bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want to do the same thing, but I've actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas. Right now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn't make sense. And all that raises revenue. And so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college. It means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me -- she's got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she's got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They're using text books that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe for growth. That's not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately, we're going to have to make some decisions. And if we're asking for no revenue, then that means that we've got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff. And the magnitude of the tax cuts that you're talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow. As I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking about potentially a 30 -- a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we're talking about a family who's got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. And governors are creative. There's no doubt about it. But they're not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help. Governor Romney: Jim, let's -- we've gone on a lot of topics there, and so it's going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools... LEHRER: Come back to... [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: ... to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let's go through them one by one. First of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that's been in place for a hundred years. Now... President Obama: It's time to end it. Governor Romney: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth. But, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it's on the table. That's probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent. But don't forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years' worth of breaks, into -- into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this -- this is not -- this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure. The second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I've been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you're talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant. LEHRER: Let's... Governor Romney: But -- but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: What we do have right now is a setting where I'd like to bring money from overseas back to this country. And, finally, Medicaid to states? I'm not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you're going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you're going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best. And I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors -- Republican and Democrats -- said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor. So -- so let's state -- one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don't have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this. And, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them. LEHRER: Let's go. Governor Romney: But -- but the right -- the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government. LEHRER: [inaudible] and we're going on -- still on the economy, on another -- but another part of it... President Obama: OK. LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First -- first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security? President Obama: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It's going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker -- Democratic Speaker Tip O'Neill. But it is -- the basic structure is sound. But -- but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that's the big driver of our deficits right now. You know, my grandmother -- some of you know -- helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected President. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice President of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice. And the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go. And that's the perspective I bring when I think about what's called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this. So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we're going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let's look where some of the money's going. $716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren't overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a -- make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the -- throughout the system. So the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don't need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future. LEHRER: We'll follow up on this. First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements. Governor Romney: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something's going to happen that's going to change their life for the worse. And the answer is neither the President nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60 or older, you don't need to listen any further. But for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the President isn't proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he's not. But on Medicare, for current retirees, he's cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \"We're going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody's going to get a lower rate.\" That's not just going after places where there's abuse. That's saying we're cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won't take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario. We also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won't take more Medicare patients. This -- we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare. Now, you point out, well, we're putting some back. We're going to give a better prescription program. That's $1 -- that's $1 for every $15 you've cut. They're smart enough to know that's not a good trade. I want to take that $716 billion you've cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to young people coming along, I've got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question. LEHRER: Mr. President? President Obama: First of all, I think it's important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future. And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program. His running mate... LEHRER: And you don't support that? President Obama: I don't. And let me explain why. Governor Romney: Again, that's for future... President Obama: I understand. Governor Romney: ... people, right, not for current retirees. President Obama: For -- so if you're -- if you're 54 or 55, you might want to listen 'cause this -- this will affect you. The idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance. The problem is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year. Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there's still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what'll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse. And then what you've got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care. So, I don't think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own -- only my opinion. AARP thinks that the -- the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \"Obamacare,\" if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They're now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier. And the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren't making seniors any healthier. And I don't think that's the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term. LEHRER: We'll talk about -- specifically about health care in a moment. But what -- do you support the voucher system, Governor? Governor Romney: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the President supports taking $716 billion out of that program. LEHRER: And what about the vouchers? [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: So that's -- that's number one. Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice. They get to choose -- and they'll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don't have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That's not going to happen. They'll have at least two plans. And by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they'll be able to get a private plan. I know my own view is I'd rather have a private plan. I'd just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I'd rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don't like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice. The other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we're going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That's the plan that I've put forward. And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or -- or Senator Wyden, who's the co-author of the bill with -- with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill -- Bill Clinton's chief of staff. This is an idea that's been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we can't get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition. President Obama: Jim, if I -- if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it. And private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That's what they do. And so you've got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere. And when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they're stuck. And this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that's why they were supportive of the approach that we took. One last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid... LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute. President Obama: ... but -- but -- but overall. LEHRER: OK. President Obama: And so... Governor Romney: That's -- that's a big topic. Can we -- can we stay on Medicare? President Obama: Is that a -- is that a separate topic? [Crosstalk] LEHRER: Yeah, we're going to -- yeah, I want to get to it. President Obama: I'm sorry. LEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly... Governor Romney: Let's get back to Medicare. LEHRER: ... before we leave the economy... Governor Romney: Let's get back to Medicare. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: The President said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit. LEHRER: All right. Governor Romney: If that's the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor. Governor Romney: But my experience -- my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost. LEHRER: All right. Can we -- can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice -- a clear choice between the two... Governor Romney: Absolutely. LEHRER: ... of you on Medicare? Governor Romney: Absolutely. President Obama: Absolutely. LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there -- should there be more? Beginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we'll go for a few minutes, and then we're going to go to health care, OK? Governor Romney: Regulation is essential. You can't have a free market work if you don't have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have -- I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn't have people opening up banks in their -- in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think? Governor Romney: In some places, yes. Other places, no. LEHRER: Like where? [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: No, it can become out of date. And what's happened with some of the legislation that's been passed during the President's term, you've seen regulation become excessive, and it's hurt -- it's hurt the economy. Let me give you an example. Dodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that's been given to -- to New York banks I've ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There've been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank. So there's one example. Here's another. In Dodd-Frank... LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank? Governor Romney: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We're not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for... LEHRER: Well, here's a specific... [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: But let's -- let's mention -- let me mention the other one. Let's talk... [Crosstalk] LEHRER: No, let's not. Let's let him respond -- let's let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said. President Obama: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board. Now, it wasn't just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were -- that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn't have been given, because the folks didn't qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn't afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren't. But you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn't even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable. So what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you've got -- banks, you've got to raise your capital requirements. You can't engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We've going to make sure that you've got to have a living will so -- so we can know how you're going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts. In the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest. Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank. And, you know, I appreciate and it appears we've got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back. And so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that's not what I believe. Governor Romney: Sorry, but that's just not -- that's just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That's why I'd have regulation. But I wouldn't designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That's one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn't thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it's killing regional and small banks. They're getting hurt. Let me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren't qualified. That's exactly right. It's one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn't ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was. It's been two years. We don't know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It's hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn't anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It's not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear regulation. I will make sure we don't hurt the functioning of our -- of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs. LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let's move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it's a two-minute new -- new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney. You want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why? Governor Romney: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can't afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we're thinking of dropping our insurance, we can't afford it. And the number of small businesses I've gone to that are saying they're dropping insurance because they can't afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And -- and we've got to deal with cost. And, unfortunately, when -- when -- when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it's adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the President ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it's gone up by that amount. So it's expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that's one reason I don't want it. Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors. Number three, it puts in place an unelected board that's going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don't like that idea. Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what's been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don't know how the President could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the -- at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs. And the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let's focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal? President Obama: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn't get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn't just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country. If they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they're paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don't have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they've hit the limit. So we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country. And let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you've got health insurance, it doesn't mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can't jerk you around. They can't impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance -- your insurance plan until you're 26 years old. And it also says that you're going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care. Number two, if you don't have health insurance, we're essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you're out there trying to get insurance on the individual market. Now, the last point I'd make before... LEHRER: Two minutes -- two minutes is up, sir. President Obama: No, I think -- I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was -- the irony is that we've seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasn't destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold. LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago. All right, Governor. Governor, tell -- tell the President directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare? Governor Romney: Well, I did with my first statement. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary -- elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway. So entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through. What we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn't raise taxes. You've raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716 billion. We didn't put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive. We didn't also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put -- put people in a position where they're going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted. Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage. So for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don't want Medicare -- don't want Obamacare. It's why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had -- had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a President who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties. President Obama: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation. And I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it's the same plan. It -- when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we've created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall? Because there -- there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that's been the trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it. So at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They -- they say, if a patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let's make sure that we're providing preventive care so we're catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let's -- let's pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they've -- they've engaged in. Now, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let's use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do. And the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we're going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up -- it's true -- but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we're already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you're already getting a rebate. Let me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I'm just going to repeal it, but -- but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states. But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance... LEHRER: Let's... President Obama: ... at a time when it's vitally important. LEHRER: Let's let the governor explain what you would do... Governor Romney: Well... LEHRER: ... if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it? [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: Well, actually it's -- it's -- it's a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That's already offered in the private marketplace. You don't have to have the government mandate that for that to occur. But let's come back to something the President and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it's more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have. [Crosstalk] Governor Romney: In my opinion, the government is not effective in -- in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be. Your example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe. This is the private market. These are small -- these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses -- excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people. In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that's happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have. That's the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best. President Obama: Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given. That's explicitly prohibited in the law. But let's go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions. Well, actually Governor, that isn't what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if you've -- if it's been under 90 days. But that's already the law and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There's a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \"insurers, you've got to take everybody.\" Now, that also means that you've got more customers. But when -- when Governor Romney says that he'll replace it with something, but can't detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn't a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem. It just reminds me of, you know, he says that he's going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That's how it's going to be paid for, but we don't know the details. He says that he's going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don't know exactly which ones. He won't tell us. He now says he's going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don't have to worry. And at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good? Is it -- is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them? No. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we've got to make choices. And the choices we've made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country. LEHRER: We're going to move to... Governor Romney: No. I -- I have to respond to that. LEHRER: No, but... Governor Romney: Which is -- which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and -- and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \"It's my way or the highway,\" I don't get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You've said the same thing, you're going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base. Those are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I'm going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what -- what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That's one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on -- on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time. The federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And -- and let's see. Role of government. And it is -- you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you -- but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President -- do you believe there's a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government? President Obama: Well, I definitely think there are differences. LEHRER: And do you -- yeah. President Obama: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That's its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I've worked on and thought about every single day that I've been in the Oval Office. But I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed. Look, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions. But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let's start the National Academy of Sciences, let's start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we're all going to be better off. That doesn't restrict people's freedom. That enhances it. And so what I've tried to do as President is to apply those same principles. And when it comes to education what I've said is we've got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn't a top-down approach, Governor. What we've said is to states, we'll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference. But what I've also said is let's hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can't all do that. In fact we've seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn't think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help. It can't do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we'll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we've got a skilled workforce. LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view? Governor Romney: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers. So I reject the idea that I don't believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own. The role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents. First, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America's military. Second, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can't care for themselves are cared by -- by one another. We're a nation that believes that we're all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we -- we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens. But we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we're seeing right now is, in my view, a -- a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it's not working. And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work. LEHRER: All right. Governor Romney: We know that the path we're taking is not working. It's time for a new path. LEHRER: All right. Let's go through some specifics in terms of what -- how each of you views the role of government. How do -- education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America? Governor Romney: Well, the primary responsibility for education is -- is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I -- and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he's -- some ideas he's put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and -- and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and -- and state schools to do a better job. My own view, by the way, is I've added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I -- these are disabled kids or -- or -- or poor kids or -- or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice. So all federal funds, instead of going to the -- to the state or to the school district, I'd have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their -- their -- their student. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government's responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country? President Obama: Well, as I've indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we've worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they're having an impact right now. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and -- and those of Governor Romney on -- about education and the federal government? President Obama: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we're having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference. You know, his -- his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney's talked about. And it wasn't very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But -- but what it did do is to -- if you extrapolated how much money we're talking about, you'd look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent. When it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they're setting up their training programs... LEHRER: Do you -- do you agree, Governor? President Obama: Let me just finish the point. [Crosstalk] President Obama: The -- where they're partnering so that they're designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there's a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support. Let me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it's two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as President was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system. And we said, \"Why not cut out the middleman?\" And as a consequence, what we've been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference. Governor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \"you should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\" you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don't have that option. And for us to be able to make sure that they've got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It's how we're going to grow this economy over the long term. LEHRER: We're running out of time, gentlemen. [Crosstalk] LEHRER: Governor? Governor Romney: Mr. President, Mr. President, you're entitled as the President to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I'm not going to cut education funding. I don't have any plan to cut education funding and -- and grants that go to people going to college. I'm planning on [inaudible] to grow. So I'm not planning on making changes there. But you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into -- into green jobs. And I -- look, I'm all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have -- that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion. And these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns. Look, the right course for America's government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world. The right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let's grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a -- to a school that he's being more successful. I don't want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I've had that experience. I don't just talk about it. I've been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn't have commitment to education. It's because I care about education for all of our kids. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen... [Crosstalk] LEHRER: Excuse me [inaudible]. Excuse me, sir. We've got -- we've got -- barely have three minutes left. I'm not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I've done a poor job. President Obama: You've done a great job. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government -- the role of government and governing, we've lost a pod in other words. So we only have three -- three minutes left in the -- in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we've got three minutes total time here -- and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that? Governor? Governor Romney: Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times. LEHRER: But what would you do as President? Governor Romney: We -- as President, I will sit on day one -- actually, the day after I get elected -- I'll sit down with leaders -- the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue -- as we did in my state -- we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the -- in the -- in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we're going to compromise our principle, but because there's common ground. And the challenges America faces right now -- look, the reason I'm in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face -- this deficit could crush the future generations. What's happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern. LEHRER: All right. Governor Romney: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership -- leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if -- if it's a Republican or a Democrat. I've done it before. I'll do it again. LEHRER: Mr. President? President Obama: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney's going to have a busy first day, because he's also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you're sitting down with them. But, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they're advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That's how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That's how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That's how we repealed \"don't ask/don't tell.\" That's how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that's how we're going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden. So we've -- we've seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \"I'll sit down,\" but you have to have a plan. Number two, what's important is occasionally you've got to say no, to -- to -- to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when -- when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street?", "filename": "03October2012FirstPresidentialCandidateDebatewithMittRomney.txt"}, {"question": "And Oskar is sitting next to his father, and his father and I agree that were getting gray, so we have to make sure that somebody is coming up behind us.  Please give Oskar a big round of applause for the great job that he did. To President Ilves and distinguished guests, to the people of Estonia -- it is a great pleasure to be with you in this historic city, in this beautiful land.  I thank you for the incredible hospitality that youve shown me today.  I understand the weather is always like this.  My only regret is that I missed this summers Laulupidu.  And Ill try to come back next time and catch it.  I bring with me the friendship of the American people, and I am honored to be the first President of the United States to deliver an address like this to the people of Estonia. I just had the opportunity to meet once again with the presidents of all the Baltic states, and I thank the presidents of Latvia and Lithuania for being here.  Were joined by friends from throughout the region.  And I want to say a special welcome to everyone watching this out in Freedom Square.  And Im especially pleased to see so many young people here today.  Because, like Oskar, you are fulfilling the dream that your parents and grandparents struggled for but could only imagine -- and that is living your lives in free and independent and democratic Baltic nations. That dream of freedom endured through centuries of occupation and oppression.  It blossomed into independence, only to have it stolen by foreign pacts and secret protocols.  It survived the mass deportations that ripped parents from their children.  It was defended by Forest Brothers in their resistance and sustained by poets and authors who kept alive your languages and cultures.  And here in Estonia, it was a dream that found its most eloquent expression in your voices -- on a grassy field not far from here, when Estonians found the courage to stand up against an empire and sing land of my fathers, land that I love. And Heinz Valk, who is here today, spoke for the entire Singing Revolution when he said, One day, no matter what, we will win! And then, exactly 25 years ago, people across the Baltics came together in one of the greatest displays of freedom and non-violent resistance that the world has ever seen.  On that August evening, perhaps two million people stepped out of their homes and joined hands -- a human chain of freedom, the Baltic Way.  And they stretched down highways and across farmlands, from Tallinn to Riga to Vilnius.  They lit candles and they sang anthems.  Old men and women brought out their flags of independence.  And young parents brought their children to teach them that when ordinary people stand together, great change is possible.  Here in Estonia, when people joined the line, the password was freedom.  As one man said that day, The Berlin Wall is made of brick and concrete.  Our wall is stronger.  And it was. Within months, that wall in Berlin was pushed open.  The next year, the Baltic peoples finally voted in elections.  And when the forces of the past made their last grab for power, you stood up.  Lithuanians faced down tanks.  Latvians manned barricades.  Here in Tallinn, citizens rushed to the TV tower to defend the airwaves of democracy.  You won.  You reclaimed your countries.  And in your new constitution you declared, The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable. But the people of the Baltic nations also knew that freedom needs a foundation of security.  So you reached out to join the NATO Alliance.  And we were proud to welcome you as new allies, so that those words of your constitution -- your timeless independence -- will always be guaranteed by the strongest military alliance the world has ever known. Today, people working to build their own democracies -- from Kyiv to Tunis -- look to you for inspiration.  Your experience cautions that progress is neither easy nor quick.  Here in the Baltics, after decades of authoritarian rule, the habits of democracy had to be learned.  The institutions of good governance had to be built.  Economies had to be reformed.  Foreign forces had to be removed from your territory. And transitions of this magnitude are daunting for any nation.  But the Baltics show the world whats possible when free peoples come together for the change that they seek.  And in that great contest of ideas -- between freedom and authoritarianism, between liberty and oppression -- your success proves, like that human chain 25 years ago, that our way will always be stronger. Were stronger because were democracies.  Were not afraid of free and fair elections, because true legitimacy can only come from one source -- and that is the people.  Were not afraid of an independent judiciary, because no one is above the law.  Were not afraid of a free press or vibrant debate or a strong civil society, because leaders must be held accountable.  Were not afraid to let our young people go online to learn and discover and organize, because we know that countries are more successful when citizens are free to think for themselves. Were stronger because we embrace open economies.  Look at the evidence.  Here in Estonia, we see the success of free markets, integration with Europe, taking on tough reforms.  Youve become one of the most wired countries on Earth -- a global leader in e-government and high-tech start-ups.  The entrepreneurial spirit of the Estonian people has been unleashed, and your innovations, like Skype, are transforming the world. And were stronger because we stand together.  This year we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Baltics in NATO.  A decade ago, skeptics wondered whether your countries were up to the task.  And today, they need only look at our training exercises, where our troops grow even stronger together, shoulder to shoulder.  They can look at Afghanistan, where our forces have sacrificed together to keep us safe -- and where, in just three months, the largest operation in NATO history will come to an end, as planned.  Theres no doubt the Baltics have made our alliance stronger. And your progress reflects a larger truth:  Because of the work of generations, because weve stood together in a great alliance, because people across this continent have forged a European Union dedicated to cooperation and peace, we have made historic progress toward the vision we share -- a Europe that is whole and free and at peace. And yet, as we gather here today, we know that this vision is threatened by Russias aggression against Ukraine.  It is a brazen assault on the territorial integrity of Ukraine -- a sovereign and independent European nation.  It challenges that most basic of principles of our international system -- that borders cannot be redrawn at the barrel of a gun; that nations have the right to determine their own future.  It undermines an international order where the rights of peoples and nations are upheld and cant simply be taken away by brute force.  This is whats at stake in Ukraine.  This is why we stand with the people of Ukraine today. Now, lets put to rest, once and for all, the distortions or outdated thinking that has caused this crisis.  Our NATO Alliance is not aimed against any other nation; were an alliance of democracies dedicated to our own collective defense.  Countries like Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania are not post-Soviet territory.  You are sovereign and independent nations with the right to make your own decisions.  No other nation gets to veto your security decisions. The protests in Ukraine, on the Maidan, were not led by neo-Nazis or fascists.  They were led by ordinary Ukrainians -- men and women, young and old -- who were fed up with a corrupt regime and who wanted to share in the progress and prosperity that they see in the rest of Europe.  And they did not engage in an armed seizure of power.  After an agreement was brokered for constitutional reform, the former president then abandoned his office, and parliament endorsed new elections so that today Ukrainians have a new democratically elected president.  And I look forward to welcoming President Poroshenko to the Oval Office this month.  He was chosen by the people of Ukraine. It was not the government in Kyiv that destabilized eastern Ukraine; its been the pro-Russian separatists who are encouraged by Russia, financed by Russia, trained by Russia, supplied by Russia and armed by Russia.  And the Russian forces that have now moved into Ukraine are not on a humanitarian or peacekeeping mission.  They are Russian combat forces with Russian weapons in Russian tanks.  Now, these are the facts.  They are provable.  Theyre not subject to dispute. As a result of state-run propaganda, many Russians have become convinced that the actions taken by their government is strengthening Russia.  But reaching back to the days of the tsars -- trying to reclaim lands lost in the 19th century -- is surely not the way to secure Russias greatness in the 21st century.   It only shows that unrestrained nationalism is the last refuge of those who cannot or will not deliver real progress and opportunity for their own people at home. Lets also be clear where we stand.  Just as we refused to accept smaller European nations being dominated by bigger neighbors in the last century, we reject any talk of spheres of influence today.   And just as we never accepted the occupation and illegal annexation of the Baltic nations, we will not accept Russias occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea or any part of Ukraine. As free peoples, as an Alliance, we will stand firm and united to meet the test of this moment, and heres how. First, we will defend our NATO Allies, and that means every Ally.  In this Alliance, there are no old members or new members, no junior partners or senior partners -- there are just Allies, pure and simple.  And we will defend the territorial integrity of every single Ally.  Today, more NATO aircraft patrol the skies of the Baltics.  More American forces are on the ground training and rotating through each of the Baltic states.  More NATO ships patrol the Black Sea.  Tonight, I depart for the NATO Summit in Wales, and I believe our Alliance should extend these defensive measures for as long as necessary.  Because the defense of Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defense of Berlin and Paris and London.

The hardship of a family trying to make ends meet.  Refugees fleeing from a war-torn home.  Those things are real.  Terrorism, eroding shorelines -- those things are real.  Even the very progress that humanity has made, the affluence, the stability that so many of us enjoy, far greater prosperity than any previous generation of humanity has experienced, shines a brighter light on those who still struggle, reveal the gap in prospects that exist for the children of the world. And that gap between want and plenty, it gives us vertigo.  It can make us afraid, not only of the possibility that progress will stall, but that maybe we have more to lose.  And fear does funny things.  Fear can lead us to lash out against those who are different, or lead us to try to get some sinister other under control.  Alternatively, fear can lead us to succumb to despair, or paralysis, or cynicism.  Fear can feed our most selfish impulses, and erode the bonds of community. It is a primal emotion -- fear -- one that we all experience.  And it can be contagious, spreading through societies, and through nations.  And if we let it consume us, the consequences of that fear can be worse than any outward threat. For me, and I know for so many of you, faith is the great cure for fear.  Jesus is a good cure for fear.  God gives believers the power, the love, the sound mind required to conquer any fear.  And what more important moment for that faith than right now?  What better time than these changing, tumultuous times to have Jesus standing beside us, steadying our minds, cleansing our hearts, pointing us towards what matters. His love gives us the power to resist fears temptations.  He gives us the courage to reach out to others across that divide, rather than push people away.  He gives us the courage to go against the conventional wisdom and stand up for whats right, even when its not popular.  To stand up not just to our enemies but, sometimes, to stand up to our friends.  He gives us the fortitude to sacrifice ourselves for a larger cause.  Or to make tough decisions knowing that we can only do our best.  Less of me, more of God.  And then, to have the courage to admit our failings and our sins while pledging to learn from our mistakes and to try to do better. Certainly, during the course of this enormous privilege to have served as the President of the United States, thats what faith has done for me.  It helps me deal with the common, everyday fears that we all share.  The main one Im feeling right now is that our children grow up too fast.  Theyre leaving.  Thats a tough deal.  And so, as a parent, youre worrying about will some harm befall them, how are they going to manage without you, did you miss some central moment in their lives.  Will they call?  Or text?  Each day, were fearful that Gods purpose becomes elusive, cloudy.  We try to figure out how we fit into his broader plan.  Theyre universal fears that we have, and my faith helps me to manage those. And then my faiths helps me to deal with some of the unique elements of my job.  As one of the great departed heroes of our age, Nelson Mandela, once said, I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. And certainly, there are times where Ive had to repeat that to myself while holding this office.  When you hear from a parade of experts, just days after youre elected, that another Great Depression is a very real possibility -- that will get your attention.  When you tell a room full of young cadets that youve made a decision to send them into harms way, knowing that some of them might not return safely -- thats sobering.  When you hold in your arms the mothers and fathers of innocent children gunned down in their classroom -- that reminds you theres evil in the world.  And so you come to understand what President Lincoln meant when he said that hed been driven to his knees by the overwhelming conviction that he had no place else to go. And so like every President, like every leader, like every person, Ive known fear.  But my faith tells me that I need not fear death; that the acceptance of Christ promises everlasting life and the washing away of sins.  If Scripture instructs me to put on the full armor of God so that when trouble comes, Im able to stand, then surely I can face down these temporal setbacks, surely I can battle back doubts, surely I can rouse myself to action. And should that faith waver, should I lose my way, I have drawn strength not only from a remarkable wife, not only from incredible colleagues and friends, but I have drawn strength from witnessing all across this country and all around this world, good people, of all faiths, who do the Lords work each and every day, Who wield that power and love, and sound mind to feed the hungry and heal the sick, to teach our children and welcome the stranger. Think about the extraordinary work of the congregations and faith communities represented here today.  Whether fighting global poverty or working to end the scourge of human trafficking, you are the leaders of what Pope Francis calls this march of living hope. When the Earth cleaves in Haiti, Christians, Sikhs, and other faith groups sent volunteers to distribute aid, tend to the wounded, rebuild homes for the homeless. When Ebola ravaged West Africa, Jewish, Christian, Muslim groups responded to the outbreak to save lives. And as the news fanned the flames of fear, churches and mosques responded with a powerful rebuke, welcoming survivors into their pews. When nine worshippers were murdered in a Charleston church basement, it was people of all faiths who came together to wrap a shattered community in love and understanding. When Syrian refugees seek the sanctuary of our shores, its the faithful from synagogues, mosques, temples, and churches who welcome them, the first to offer blankets and food and open their homes.  Even now, people of different faiths and beliefs are coming together to help people suffering in Flint. And then theres the most -- less spectacular, more quiet efforts of congregations all across this country just helping people.  Seeing God in others.  And were driven to do this because were driven by the value that so many of our faiths teach us - I am my brothers keeper, I am my sisters keeper.  As Christians, we do this compelled by the Gospel of Jesus -- the command to love God, and love one another. And so, yes, like every person, there are times where Im fearful.  But my faith and, more importantly, the faith that Ive seen in so many of you, the God I see in you, that makes me inevitably hopeful about our future.  I have seen so many who know that God has not given us a spirit of fear.  He has given us power, and love, and a sound mind. We see that spirit in people like Pastor Saeed Abedini, imprisoned for no crime other than holding God in his heart.  And last year, we prayed that he might be freed.  And this year, we give thanks that he is home safe. We pray for Gods protection for all around the world who are not free to practice their faith, including Christians who are persecuted, or who have been driven from their ancient homelands by unspeakable violence.     And just as we call on other countries to respect the rights of religious minorities, we, too, respect the right of every single American to practice their faith freely.  For this is what each of us is called on to do:  To seek our common humanity in each other.  To make sure our politics and our public discourse reflect that same spirit of love and sound mind.  To assume the best in each other and not just the worst -- and not just at the National Prayer Breakfast. To begin each of our works from the shared belief that all of us want whats good and right for our country and our future. We can draw such strength from the quiet moments of heroism around us every single day.  And so let me close with two such stories that Ive come to know just over the past week. A week ago, I spoke at a ceremony held at the Israeli Embassy for the first time, honoring the courage of people who saved Jews during the Holocaust.  And one of the recipients was the grandson -- or the son of an American soldier who had been captured by the Nazis.  So a group of American soldiers are captured, and their captors ordered Jewish POWs to identify themselves.  And one sergeant, a Christian named Roddie Edmonds, from Tennessee, ordered all American troops to report alongside them.  They lined up in formation, approximately 200 of them, and the Nazi colonel said, I asked only for the Jewish POWs, and said, These cant all be Jewish.  And Master Sergeant Edmonds stood there and said, We are all Jews.  And the colonel took out his pistol and held it to the Master Sergeants head and said, Tell me who the Jews are.  And he repeated, We are all Jews.  And faced with the choice of shooting all those soldiers, the Nazis relented.  And so, through his moral clarity, through an act of faith, Sergeant Edmonds saved the lives of his Jewish brothers-in-arms. A second story.  Just yesterday, some of you may be aware I visited a mosque in Baltimore to let our Muslim-American brothers and sisters know that they, too, are Americans and welcome here.  And there I met a Muslim-American named Rami Nashashibi, who runs a nonprofit working for social change in Chicago.  And he forms coalitions with churches and Latino groups and African Americans in this poor neighborhood in Chicago.  And he told me how the day after the tragedy in San Bernardino happened, he took his three young children to a playground in the Marquette Park neighborhood, and while they were out, the time came for one of the five daily prayers that are essential to the Muslim tradition.  And on any other day, he told me, he would have immediately put his rug out on the grass right there and prayed. But that day, he paused.  He feared any unwelcome attention he might attract to himself and his children.  And his seven year-old daughter asked him, What are you doing, Dad?  Isn't it time to pray?", "filename": "04February2016Speechatthe64thNationalPrayerBreakfast.txt"}, {"question": "President; Mr. Prime Minister; Madam Mayor; heads of state and government, past and present -- including the man who jumped that shipyard wall to lead a strike that became a movement, the prisoner turned President who transformed this nation -- thank you, Lech Walesa, for your outstanding leadership. Distinguished guests, people of Poland, thank you for your extraordinary welcome and for the privilege of joining you here today.  I bring with me the greetings and friendship of the American people -- and of my hometown of Chicago, home to so many proud Polish Americans.  In Chicago, we think of ourselves as a little piece of Poland.  In some neighborhoods, you only hear Polish.  The faithful come together at churches like Saint Stanislaus Kostka.  We have a parade for Polish Constitution Day.  And every summer, we celebrate the Taste of Polonia, with our kielbasa and pierogies, and were all a little bit Polish for that day. So being here with you, it feels like home. Twenty-five years ago today, we witnessed a scene that had once seemed impossible -- an election where, for the first time, the people of this nation had a choice.  The Communist regime thought an election would validate their rule or weaken the opposition.  Instead, Poles turned out in the millions.  And when the votes were counted, it was a landslide victory for freedom.  One woman who voted that day said, There is a sense that something is beginning to happen in Poland.  We feel the taste of Poland again.  She was right.  It was the beginning of the end of Communism -- not just in this country, but across Europe. The images of that year are seared in our memory.  Citizens filling the streets of Budapest and Bucharest.  Hungarians and Austrians cutting the barbed wire border.  Protestors joining hands across the Baltics.  Czechs and Slovaks in their Velvet Revolution.  East Berliners climbing atop that wall.  And we have seen the extraordinary progress since that time.  A united Germany.  Nations in Central and Eastern Europe standing tall as proud democracies.  A Europe that is more integrated, more prosperous and more secure.  We must never forget that the spark for so much of this revolutionary change, this blossoming of hope, was lit by you, the people of Poland. History was made here.  The victory of 1989 was not inevitable.  It was the culmination of centuries of Polish struggle, at times in this very square.  The generations of Poles who rose up and finally won independence.  The soldiers who resisted invasion, from the east and the west.  The Righteous Among the Nations -- among them Jan Karski -- who risked all to save the innocent from the Holocaust.  The heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto who refused to go without a fight.  The Free Poles at Normandy and the Poles of the Home Army who -- even as this city was reduced to rubble -- waged a heroic uprising.  We remember how, when an Iron Curtain descended, you never accepted your fate.  When a son of Poland ascended to the Chair of Saint Peter, he returned home, and here, in Warsaw, he inspired a nation with his words -- there can be no just Europe without the independence of Poland.  And today we give thanks for the courage of the Catholic Church and the fearless spirit of Saint John Paul II. We also recall how you prevailed 25 years ago.  In the face of beatings and bullets, you never wavered from the moral force of nonviolence.  Through the darkness of martial law, Poles lit candles in their windows.  When the regime finally agreed to talk, you embraced dialogue.  When they held those elections -- even though not fully free -- you participated.  As one Solidarity leader said at the time, We decided to accept what was possible.  Poland reminds us that sometimes the smallest steps, however imperfect, can ultimately tear down walls, can ultimately transform the world. But of course, your victory that June day was only the beginning.  For democracy is more than just elections.  True democracy, real prosperity, lasting security -- these are neither simply given, nor imposed from the outside.  They must be earned and built from within.  And in that age-old contest of ideas -- between freedom and authoritarianism, between liberty and oppression, between solidarity and intolerance -- Polands progress shows the enduring strength of the ideals that we cherish as a free people. Here we see the strength of democracy:  Citizens raising their voices, free from fear.  Here we see political parties competing in open and honest elections.  Here we see an independent judiciary working to uphold the rule of law.  Here in Poland we see a vibrant press and a growing civil society that holds leaders accountable -- because governments exist to lift up their people, not to hold them down. Here we see the strength of free markets and the results of hard reforms -- gleaming skyscrapers soaring above the city, and superhighways across this country, high-tech hubs and living standards that previous generations of Poles could only imagine. This is the new Poland you have built -- an economic Miracle on the Vistula -- Cud nad Wis. Here we see the strength of free nations that stand united. Across those centuries of struggle, Polands fate too often was dictated by others.  This land was invaded and conquered, carved up and occupied.  But those days are over.  Poland understands as few other nations do that every nation must be free to chart its own course, to forge its own partnerships, to choose its own allies. This year marks the 15th anniversary of Polands membership in NATO.  We honor Polish service in the Balkans, in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And as Americans, we are proud to call Poland one of our strongest and closest allies. This is the Poland we celebrate today.  The free and democratic Poland that your forebears and some who are here today dreamed of and fought for and, in some cases, died for.  The growing and secure Poland that you -- particularly the young people who are here today -- have enjoyed for your entire lives. Its a wonderful story, but the story of this nation reminds us that freedom is not guaranteed.  And history cautions us to never take progress for granted.  On the same day 25 years ago that Poles were voting here, tanks were crushing peaceful democracy protests in Tiananmen Square on the other side of the world.  The blessings of liberty must be earned and renewed by every generation -- including our own.  This is the work to which we rededicate ourselves today.  Our democracies must be defined not by what or who were against, but by a politics of inclusion and tolerance that welcomes all our citizens.  Our economies must deliver a broader prosperity that creates more opportunity -- across Europe and across the world -- especially for young people.  Leaders must uphold the public trust and stand against corruption, not steal from the pockets of their own people.  Our societies must embrace a greater justice that recognizes the inherent dignity of every human being.  And as weve been reminded by Russias aggression in Ukraine, our free nations cannot be complacent in pursuit of the vision we share -- a Europe that is whole and free and at peace.  We have to work for that.  We have to stand with those who seek freedom. I know that throughout history, the Polish people were abandoned by friends when you needed them most.  So Ive come to Warsaw today -- on behalf of the United States, on behalf of the NATO Alliance -- to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Polands security.  Article 5 is clear -- an attack on one is an attack on all.  And as allies, we have a solemn duty -- a binding treaty obligation -- to defend your territorial integrity.  And we will.  We stand together -- now and forever -- for your freedom is ours.  Poland will never stand alone.  But not just Poland -- Estonia will never stand alone.  Latvia will never stand alone.  Lithuania will never stand alone.  Romania will never stand alone. These are not just words.  Theyre unbreakable commitments backed by the strongest alliance in the world and the armed forces of the United States of America -- the most powerful military in history.  You see our commitment today. In NATO aircraft in the skies of the Baltics.  In allied ships patrolling the Black Sea.  In the stepped-up exercises where our forces train together.  And in our increased and enduring American presence here on Polish soil.  We do these things not to threaten any nation, but to defend the security and territory of ourselves and our friends.  Yesterday, I announced a new initiative to bolster the security of our NATO allies and increase Americas military presence in Europe.  With the support of Congress, this will mean more pre-positioned equipment to respond quickly in a crisis, and exercises and training to keep our forces ready; additional U.S. forces -- in the air, and sea, and on land, including here in Poland.  And it will mean increased support to help friends like Ukraine, and Moldova and Georgia provide for their own defense. Just as the United States is increasing our commitment, so must others.  Every NATO member is protected by our alliance, and every NATO member must carry its share in our alliance.  This is the responsibility we have to each other. Finally, as free peoples, we join together, not simply to safeguard our own security but to advance the freedom of others. Today we affirm the principles for which we stand.  We stand together because we believe that people and nations have the right to determine their own destiny.  And that includes the people of Ukraine.  Robbed by a corrupt regime, Ukrainians demanded a government that served them.  Beaten and bloodied, they refused to yield.  Threatened and harassed, they lined up to vote; they elected a new President in a free election -- because a leaders legitimacy can only come from the consent of the people. Ukrainians have now embarked on the hard road of reform.  I met with President-elect Poroshenko this morning, and I told him that, just as free nations offered support and assistance to Poland in your transition to democracy, we stand with Ukrainians now.  Ukraine must be free to choose its own future for itself and by itself.  We reject the zero-sum thinking of the past -- a free and independent Ukraine needs strong ties and growing trade with Europe and Russia and the United States and the rest of the world.  Because the people of Ukraine are reaching out for the same freedom and opportunities and progress that we celebrate here today -- and they deserve them, too. We stand together because we believe that upholding peace and security is the responsibility of every nation.  The days of empire and spheres of influence are over.  Bigger nations must not be allowed to bully the small, or impose their will at the barrel of a gun or with masked men taking over buildings.  And the stroke of a pen can never legitimize the theft of a neighbors land.  So we will not accept Russias occupation of Crimea or its violation of Ukraines sovereignty.  Our free nations will stand united so that further Russian provocations will only mean more isolation and costs for Russia.  Because after investing so much blood and treasure to bring Europe together, how can we allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define this new century?", "filename": "04June2014PolishFreedomDayAnniversaryAddress.txt"}, {"question": "It worried folks in the White House who said, \"You know, we're battling Communism. How are we going to win hearts and minds all across the world?", "filename": "04March2007BrownChapelSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "There are still battles that need to be fought; some rivers that need to be crossed. Like Moses, the task was passed on to those who might not have been as deserving, might not have been as courageous, find themselves in front of the risks that their parents and grandparents and great grandparents had taken. That doesn't mean that they don't still have a burden to shoulder, that they don't have some responsibilities. The previous generation, the Moses generation, pointed the way. They took us 90% of the way there. We still got that 10% in order to cross over to the other side. So the question, I guess, that I have today is what's called of us in this Joshua generation? What do we do in order to fulfill that legacy; to fulfill the obligations and the debt that we owe to those who allowed us to be here today?", "filename": "04March2007BrownChapelSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "We have less-qualified teachers in those schools.

You've got Katrina still undone. I went down to New Orleans three weeks ago. It still looks bombed out. Still not rebuilt. When 9/11 happened, the federal government had a special program of grants to help rebuild. They waived any requirement that Manhattan would have to pay 10% of the cost of rebuilding. When Hurricane Andrew happened in Florida, 10% requirement, they waived it because they understood that some disasters are so devastating that we can't expect a community to rebuild. New Orleans -- the largest national catastrophe in our history, the federal government says where's your 10%?", "filename": "04March2007BrownChapelSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "There is a gap in terms of sympathizing for the folks in New Orleans. It's not a gap that the American people felt because we saw how they responded. But somehow our government didn't respond with that same sense of compassion, with that same sense of kindness.

A hope gap. A hope gap that still pervades too many communities all across the country and right here in Alabama.

Members of Congress are here, including your outstanding senator, Debbie Stabenow.  Flint's own Dan Kildee is here.  Debbie Dingell is here.    Brenda Lawrence is here.  John Conyers is here.  And Sandy Levin.  An outstanding Michigan delegation.  We've got Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who is the head of Health and Human Services, works for me. And Administrator Gina McCarthy is here, as well.  I want to thank Superintendent Bilal Tawwab -- and Principal Tim Green for their hospitality.  And I want to thank all of you for being here. Now, not too long ago, I received a letter from a young lady, an eight-year-old girl named Mari Copeny.  You may know her as \"Little Miss Flint.\" Those of you who have seats, please feel free to sit down so folks can see behind you.  If you don't have a seat, don't sit down. And like a lot of you, Mari has been worried about what happened here in Flint.  She's worried about what it means for children like her.  She's worried about the future of this city and this community. So in the middle of a tragedy that should have never happened here in the United States of America -- the denial of something as basic as clean, safe drinking water -- this eight-year-old girl spoke out and marched and, like many of you, protested.  As Mari was getting ready to hop on a bus to Washington, she wrote to ask if she could meet with me while she was in town.  There she is. Now, I would have been happy to see Mari in Washington.  But when something like this happens, a young girl shouldn't have to go to Washington to be heard.  I thought her President should come to Flint to meet with her.    And that's why I'm here -- to tell you directly that I see you and I hear you, and I want to hear directly from you about how this public health crisis has disrupted your lives, how it's made you angry, how it's made you worried. And I just had a chance to meet with a few of your neighbors in a roundtable discussion, and I heard from them what I know a lot of you are feeling:  That a lot of you are scared.  That all of you feel let down. And I told them that I understood why you'd be afraid -- not just for yourselves, but for your kids. I also wanted to come here, though, to tell you that I've got your back -- that we're paying attention.  So I met and heard directly from those who are leading the federal response and who are working hard to make sure that Flint is whole again, to make sure that this proud city bounces back not just to where it was, but stronger than ever.  And I want all of you to know I am confident that Flint will come back.    I will not rest, and I'm going to make sure that the leaders, at every level of government, don't rest until every drop of water that flows to your homes is safe to drink and safe to cook with, and safe to bathe in -- because that's part of the basic responsibilities of a government in the United States of America. So as President, I've sent Flint the best resources our federal government has to support our state and local partners.  The agencies that serve you -- the agencies that specialize in health and housing, and those that support small businesses and our kids' education; those that are responsible for the food that our children eat and, of course, the water we drink. Everybody is on duty.  The National Guard is on duty.  This is a hands-on-deck situation -- all hands on deck.  Because if there's a child who feels neglected on the north side of Flint, or a family on the east side of this city who wonders whether they should give up on their hometown and move away, or an immigrant who wonders whether America means what we say about being a place where we take care of our own.  That matters to all of us -- not just in Flint, not just in Michigan, but all across America.  Flint's recovery is everybody's responsibility.    And I'm going to make sure that responsibility is met. So I just talked with some of the team of responders that are on the ground to make sure that they're coordinating.  And they're doing some incredible things.  They've distributed enough water to fill more than three Olympic-sized swimming pools.  They've distributed thousands of filters.  They're helping students afford nutritious food that work against the contaminants in bad water.  They're making sure new moms have access to instant infant formula that doesn't require water.  They've expanded health services for children and pregnant women, and education programs for Flint's youngest children.  They're out there testing homes for lead and testing children for exposure to lead. But like all our best responses in tough times, this is not a government effort alone.  We need our businesses and nonprofits and philanthropies to step up.  And what's incredible about Flint is how many volunteers have already been leading the way.    You've got members of one union, UA Local 370, that have donated tens of thousands of dollars and 10,000 hours of their time.  They've installed thousands of filters, hundreds of faucets by going door to door, night and day.  They're not asking for anything in return, they're just doing the right thing. So many Americans, here in Flint and around the country, have proven that you don't have be a plumber or a pipefitter to pitch in -- although it's very helpful if you're a plumber or pipefitter.  So, in March, dozens of accountants teamed up with the American Red Cross to help residents recycle all the plastic water bottles that have been piling up.  Religious and community groups are organizing supply drives, supporting families, offering free medical services. The director of a local dance studio, I understand, found a creative way to help; she's letting people use her studio as a space to support one another by sharing their stories and realizing they're not alone.  Even inmates at an Indiana prison came together to donate more than $2,500 to the people of Flint.   And a second-grader from Virginia, a young man named Isiah Britt, set up a website to see if he could raise $500 for hand sanitizers to send to the kids at Eisenhower Elementary here in Flint.   So Isiah, it's fair to say, surpassed his goal, because he raised $15,000.    And he explained that the experience taught him just because you're small \"doesn't mean you can't do big things.\" So when you think of all those stories, it should be clear that the American people care about Flint.  The American people are paying attention and they care about you.  And as is true when disasters strike in other ways, people pitch in, they come together.  Because they imagine, \"All right, that could have been me.\"  That's the good news. The bad news is that this should not have happened in the first place.   And even though the scope of the response looks sort of like the efforts we're used to seeing after a natural disaster, that's not what this was. This was a manmade disaster.  This was avoidable.  This was preventable. Now, I'm not here to go through the full history of what happened.  Like a lot of manufacturing towns, Flint's economy has been taking hits for decades now -- plants closing, jobs moving away.  Manufacturing has shrunk.  And that's made it harder for the city to maintain city services.  And let's face it, government officials at every level weren't attentive to potential problems the way they should have been.  So they start getting short-staffed, they start getting a shrinking tax base, more demand for services.  Things start getting strained, and there's not enough help from the outside.  And then when Flint's finances collapsed, an emergency manager was put in place whose mandate was primarily to cut at all costs.  And then some very poor decisions were made.  All these things contributed to this crisis.  Many of you know the story. Now, I do not believe that anybody consciously wanted to hurt the people in Flint.  And this is not the place to sort out every screw-up that resulted in contaminated water.  But I do think there is a larger issue that we have to acknowledge, because I do think that part of what contributed to this crisis was a broader mindset, a bigger attitude, a corrosive attitude that exists in our politics and exists in too many levels of our government. And it's a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good no matter what.  It's a mindset that says environmental rules designed to keep your water clean or your air clean are optional, or not that important, or unnecessarily burden businesses or taxpayers.  It's an ideology that undervalues the common good, says we're all on our own and what's in it for me, and how do I do well, but I'm not going to invest in what we need as a community.  And, as a consequence, you end up seeing an underinvestment in the things that we all share that make us safe, that make us whole, that give us the ability to pursue our own individual dreams.  So we underinvest in pipes underground.  We underinvest in bridges that we drive on, and the roads that connect us, and the schools that move us forward. And this is part of the attitude, this is part of the mindset:  We especially underinvest when the communities that are put at risk are poor, or don't have a lot of political clout -- and so are not as often heard in the corridors of power. And this kind of thinking -- this myth that government is always the enemy; that forgets that our government is us -- it's us; that it's an extension of us, ourselves -- that attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stuff that resulted in lead in your water.  Because what happens is it leads to systematic neglect.  It leads to carelessness and callousness.    It leads to a lot of hidden disasters that you don't always read about and aren't as flashy, but that over time diminish the life of a community and make it harder for our young people to succeed. In one of the roundtables, I was listening to somebody -- I think it was a pastor who told me, you know, it made us feel like we didn't count.  And you can't have a democracy where people feel like they don't count, where people feel like they're not heard. And that attitude ignores how this country was built, our entire history -- which is based on the idea that we're all connected and that what happens in a community like Flint matters everybody, and that there are things that we can only do together, as a nation, as a people, as a state, as a city that no man is an island. We've been debating this since the Republic began:  What are our individual responsibilities and what are our collective responsibilities.  And that's a good debate.  But I've always believed what the first Republican President, a guy named Abraham Lincoln, said.  He said we should do individually those things that we do best by ourselves.  But through our government, we should do together what we can't do as well for ourselves. So it doesn't matter how hard you work, how responsible you are, or how well you raise your kids -- you can't set up a whole water system for a city.  That's not something you do by yourself.  You do it with other people.  You can't hire your own fire department, or your own police force, or your own army.  There are things we have to do together -- basic things that we all benefit from. And that's how we invested in a rail system and a highway system. That's how we invested in public schools.  That's how we invested in science and research.  These how we invested in community colleges and land grant colleges like Michigan State. Can I get some water?    Come on up here.  Give me some water.  I want a glass of water.  I want a glass of water.  Sit down.  I'm all right.  I'm going to get a glass of water right here.  Let's make sure we find one.  It will be filtered.  Hold on, I'm going to talk about that in a second.  Settle down, everybody. Where was I?  We invested in our communities and our cities.  And by making those investments in the common good, we invested in ourselves. That's the platform we create that allows each of us independently to succeed.  That's what made America great. So the people in Flint, and across Michigan, and around the country -- individuals and church groups and non-for-profits and community organizations -- you've proven that the American people will step up when required.  And our volunteers, our non-for-profits, they're the lifeblood of our communities.  We so appreciate what you do. But volunteers don't build county water systems and keep lead from leaching into our drinking glasses.  We can't rely on faith groups to reinforce bridges and repave runways at the airport.  We can't ask second-graders, even ones as patriotic as Isiah Britt who raised all that money, to raise enough money to keep our kids healthy. You hear a lot about government overreach, how Obama -- he's for big government.  Listen, it's not government overreach to say that our government is responsible for making sure you can wash your hands in your own sink, or shower in your own home, or cook for your family.   These are the most basic services.  There is no more basic element sustaining human life than water.  It's not too much to expect for all Americans that their water is going to be safe. Now, where do we go from here? Well, I'm still waiting for my water.  Somebody obviously didn't hear me. Usually I get my water pretty quick.  Hold on a second. Now, the reason I know I'm okay is because I already had some Flint water.  There we go.  I really did need a glass of water.  This is not a stunt. Now, I'm going to talk about this.  Everybody settle down.  This is a feisty crowd.  Hold on a second.  All right, everybody settle down.  I got some serious points to make here. So where do we go from here?  Now, Mayor Weaver has a plan to fix the pipes in Flint.  And unfortunately, because the state initially cut so many corners, it's going to end up being more expensive -- much more expensive now than it would have been to avert the disaster in the first place.  But the good news is that Michigan does have funds it can use from the federal government to help Flint.  The Governor indicated that in his budget he has put forward additional funds to replace the pipes.  In order for it to happen -- and I said this to the Mayor and the Governor; I had them both in my car, the Beast -- I told them I wasn't going to let either of them out until we figured this out.    I had Secret Service surrounding everybody. But what I said was, is that the city and the state and the federal government, everybody is going to have to work together to get this done.  So it's not going to happen overnight.  But we have to get started.  We have to get the money flowing.  We've got to work with our plumbers and pipefitters, but also train local residents and start getting apprenticeship programs going -- so that even as we're trying to deal with this disaster, we're also hopefully lifting people up and giving them an opportunity for employment.    Congress, led by your congressional delegation, needs to act in a bipartisan fashion, do their job, make sure Flint has the necessary resources. And so it's long past time that Flint has a well-managed, monitored, modern water system that protects not just against lead, but other contaminants.  All right?  So that's our goal.  That's one goal. But we've got to do more than just ensure the integrity and safety of your water for the long term.  What we also have to do is work as one team -- federal, state, and local leaders, Democrats and Republicans -- to address some of the broader issues that have been raised by this crisis.  The federal officials I met with today are committed to staying on the job until we get it done.    But that requires the state of Michigan to step up and be fully invested in this process, as well.    Today's vote in Lansing to increase funding for health care was a good start. But part of keeping the faith with the people of Flint means making sure that you're first in line for the jobs this effort will create.    It means that since the state voted this afternoon to expand Medicaid, every child who lived in Flint while the water was bad needs to be able to get seen by a doctor, diagnosed, make sure that there's follow-up.  We can't just promise it, we've got to deliver it.  And that means everybody has got to cooperate.  Everybody has got to cooperate. And keeping the faith with you also means the state has to step up and deliver the resources that will help not only fix the water, but transform Flint so that it is once again a functioning city with the capacity and the democratic structures to work.  The city government has to be on a firm foundation.  The mayor can't do it by herself.  She's got to have a team and a staff, and there's got to be a budget that works, that's sustainable, and a plan for long-term economic development, and a plan to make sure that health care is available to all of our kids, and a plan to make sure that education is top-notch in this city, and that more jobs are being created.    And that will require many more of the good work that we've seen from citizens and community groups who care about your families. But it's not enough just to fix the water.  We've got to fix the culture of neglect, the mindset I was talking about -- that has degraded too many schools and too many roads and hurt too many futures.  We've got to fix the mindset that only leaves people cynical about our government.  Our government is us -- of us, by us, for us -- the people. So we've got a lot of work to do.  But I'm here to tell you I'm prepared to work with you on this.  I'm paying attention. Now, a couple of specific things I want to address.  These aren't in my prepared remarks, but this is what I gathered from the conversations that I had. I'm in Flint right now, not Detroit.  But I do love Detroit.  And their school needs support, and there is -- some of that same mindset has hurt the schools there. But listen up, because this is drawn from the conversations I had with many of your neighbors and friends, as well as the federal response teams that I sent out here a while back.  We're going to do everything we can to accelerate getting new pipes here in Flint.    But even with all the money, even with an efficient, speeded-up process, it's going to take a while for all the pipes to be replaced.  It's not going to happen next month.  It's not going to happen six months from now, where all the pipes in Flint are going to be replaced.  We've got to get started, and you need to see that it's getting started and that progress is being made.  But it's not going to happen overnight.  Even if we get all the plumbers and pipefitters, and we get some more apprentices trained -- even if we do all that, it's going to take some time. And so one of the things I heard talking to a lot of your neighbors is, boy, right now it's rough just trying to figure out how to get bottled water on the way home from work, and you're trying to just shower real quick, and people are still concerned about what's safe and what information is correct and what is not.  So I do want to just tell you what I know, based on not just what I've been reading in the papers, but what our top scientists have told me. The first is that while you are waiting to get your pipes replaced, you need to have a filter installed, and use that filter.  And if you do use that filter, then the water is safe to consume for children over the age of six and who are not pregnant. Now, hold on a second.  Don't just start shouting, okay?  Because this is the problem -- we're going to have to solve this problem.  And if people don't listen to each other, then it's not going to get fixed. So I'm telling you -- and I promise you, I'm really good at stirring folks up.  So if I want to just come here and stir folks up, I know how to do that.  But that's not actually going to solve the problem, all right?", "filename": "04May2016FlintMichiganCommunitySpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Sasha and Malia, I love you both more than you can imagine, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House. And while she's no longer with us, I know my grandmother's watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight, and I know that my debt to them is beyond measure. To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters -- thank you so much for the support that you've given me. I am grateful to them. And to my campaign manager, David Plouffe -- the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best -- the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America. To my chief strategist David Axelrod -- who's been a partner with me every step of the way. To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics -- you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done. But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give 5 dollars and 10 dollars and 20 dollars to the cause. It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep. It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth. This is your victory. And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century. Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us. There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage or pay their doctors' bills or save enough for their child's college education. There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair. The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you, we as a people will get there. There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as President. And we know the government can't solve every problem. But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years -- block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand. What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other. Let us remember that, if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers. In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long. Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a Party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress. As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours: \"We are not enemies but friends....\" \"Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.\" And to those Americans who -- whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your President, too. And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand. To those -- To those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we've proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity, and unyielding hope. That's the true genius of America: that America can change. Our union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow. This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight's about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old. She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can. At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot: Yes we can. When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose: Yes we can. When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved: Yes we can. She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that \"we shall overcome\": Yes we can. A man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination. And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change: Yes we can. America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves -- if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?", "filename": "04November2008President-ElectVictorySpeech.txt"}, {"question": "It is a great honor to be back at American University, which has prepared generations of young people for service in public life.  I want to thank President Kerwin and the American University family for hosting us here today.    Fifty-two years ago, President Kennedy, at the height of the Cold War, addressed this same university on the subject of peace.  The Berlin Wall had just been built.  The Soviet Union had tested the most powerful weapons ever developed.  China was on the verge of acquiring a nuclear bomb.  Less than 20 years after the end of World War II, the prospect of nuclear war was all too real.  With all of the threats that we face today, its hard to appreciate how much more dangerous the world was at that time.    In light of these mounting threats, a number of strategists here in the United States argued that we had to take military action against the Soviets, to hasten what they saw as inevitable confrontation.  But the young President offered a different vision.  Strength, in his view, included powerful armed forces and a willingness to stand up for our values around the world.  But he rejected the prevailing attitude among some foreign policy circles that equated security with a perpetual war footing.  Instead, he promised strong, principled American leadership on behalf of what he called a practical and attainable peace -- a peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions -- on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements.  Such wisdom would help guide our ship of state through some of the most perilous moments in human history.  With Kennedy at the helm, the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved peacefully.  Under Democratic and Republican Presidents, new agreements were forged -- a Non-Proliferation Treaty that prohibited nations from acquiring nuclear weapons, while allowing them to access peaceful nuclear energy; the SALT and START Treaties which bound the United States and Soviet Union to cooperation on arms control.  Not every conflict was averted, but the world avoided nuclear catastrophe, and we created the time and the space to win the Cold War without firing a shot at the Soviets.  The agreement now reached between the international community and the Islamic Republic of Iran builds on this tradition of strong, principled diplomacy.  After two years of negotiations, we have achieved a detailed arrangement that permanently prohibits Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  It cuts off all of Irans pathways to a bomb.  It contains the most comprehensive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.  As was true in previous treaties, it does not resolve all problems; it certainly doesnt resolve all our problems with Iran.  It does not ensure a warming between our two countries.  But it achieves one of our most critical security objectives.  As such, it is a very good deal.  Today, I want to speak to you about this deal, and the most consequential foreign policy debate that our country has had since the invasion of Iraq, as Congress decides whether to support this historic diplomatic breakthrough, or instead blocks it over the objection of the vast majority of the world.  Between now and the congressional vote in September, youre going to hear a lot of arguments against this deal, backed by tens of millions of dollars in advertising.  And if the rhetoric in these ads, and the accompanying commentary, sounds familiar, it should -- for many of the same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran nuclear deal.  Now, when I ran for President eight years ago as a candidate who had opposed the decision to go to war in Iraq, I said that America didnt just have to end that war -- we had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place.  It was a mindset characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy; a mindset that put a premium on unilateral U.S. action over the painstaking work of building international consensus; a mindset that exaggerated threats beyond what the intelligence supported.  Leaders did not level with the American people about the costs of war, insisting that we could easily impose our will on a part of the world with a profoundly different culture and history.  And, of course, those calling for war labeled themselves strong and decisive, while dismissing those who disagreed as weak -- even appeasers of a malevolent adversary.  More than a decade later, we still live with the consequences of the decision to invade Iraq.  Our troops achieved every mission they were given.  But thousands of lives were lost, tens of thousands wounded. That doesnt count the lives lost among Iraqis.  Nearly a trillion dollars was spent. Today, Iraq remains gripped by sectarian conflict, and the emergence of al Qaeda in Iraq has now evolved into ISIL.  And ironically, the single greatest beneficiary in the region of that war was the Islamic Republic of Iran, which saw its strategic position strengthened by the removal of its long-standing enemy, Saddam Hussein.  I raise this recent history because now more than ever we need clear thinking in our foreign policy.  And I raise this history because it bears directly on how we respond to the Iranian nuclear program.   That program has been around for decades, dating back to the Shahs efforts -- with U.S. support -- in the 1960s and 70s to develop nuclear power.  The theocracy that overthrew the Shah accelerated the program after the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, a war in which Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to brutal effect, and Irans nuclear program advanced steadily through the 1990s, despite unilateral U.S. sanctions. When the Bush Administration took office, Iran had no centrifuges -- the machines necessary to produce material for a bomb -- that were spinning to enrich uranium.  But despite repeated warnings from the United States government, by the time I took office, Iran had installed several thousand centrifuges, and showed no inclination to slow -- much less halt -- its program.   Among U.S. policymakers, theres never been disagreement on the danger posed by an Iranian nuclear bomb.  Democrats and Republicans alike have recognized that it would spark an arms race in the worlds most unstable region, and turn every crisis into a potential nuclear showdown.  It would embolden terrorist groups, like Hezbollah, and pose an unacceptable risk to Israel, which Iranian leaders have repeatedly threatened to destroy. More broadly, it could unravel the global commitment to non-proliferation that the world has done so much to defend.  The question, then, is not whether to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but how.  Even before taking office, I made clear that Iran would not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon on my watch, and its been my policy throughout my presidency to keep all options -- including possible military options -- on the table to achieve that objective.  But I have also made clear my preference for a peaceful, diplomatic resolution of the issue -- not just because of the costs of war, but also because a negotiated agreement offered a more effective, verifiable and durable resolution.   And so, in 2009, we let the Iranians know that a diplomatic path was available.  Iran failed to take that path, and our intelligence community exposed the existence of a covert nuclear facility at Fordow.  Now, some have argued that Irans intransigence showed the futility of negotiations.  In fact, it was our very willingness to negotiate that helped America rally the world to our cause, and secured international participation in an unprecedented framework of commercial and financial sanctions.  Keep in mind unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran had been in place for decades, but had failed to pressure Iran to the negotiating table.  What made our new approach more effective was our ability to draw upon new U.N. Security Council resolutions, combining strong enforcement with voluntary agreements from nations like China and India, Japan and South Korea to reduce their purchases of Iranian oil, as well as the imposition by our European allies of a total oil embargo.  Winning this global buy-in was not easy -- I know.  I was there.  In some cases, our partners lost billions of dollars in trade because of their decision to cooperate.  But we were able to convince them that absent a diplomatic resolution, the result could be war, with major disruptions to the global economy, and even greater instability in the Middle East.  In other words, it was diplomacy -- hard, painstaking diplomacy -- not saber-rattling, not tough talk that ratcheted up the pressure on Iran.   With the world now unified beside us, Irans economy contracted severely, and remains about 20 percent smaller today than it would have otherwise been.  No doubt this hardship played a role in Irans 2013 elections, when the Iranian people elected a new government that promised to improve the economy through engagement with the world.  A window had cracked open.  Iran came back to the nuclear talks.  And after a series of negotiations, Iran agreed with the international community to an interim deal -- a deal that rolled back Irans stockpile of near 20 percent enriched uranium, and froze the progress of its program so that the P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the European Union -- could negotiate a comprehensive deal without the fear that Iran might be stalling for time.  Now, let me pause here just to remind everybody that when the interim deal was announced, critics -- the same critics were hearing from now -- called it a historic mistake.  They insisted Iran would ignore its obligations.  They warned that sanctions would unravel.  They warned that Iran would receive a windfall to support terrorism.  The critics were wrong.  The progress of Irans nuclear program was halted for the first time in a decade.  Its stockpile of dangerous materials was reduced.  The deployment of its advanced centrifuges was stopped.  Inspections did increase. There was no flood of money into Iran, and the architecture of the international sanctions remained in place.  In fact, the interim deal worked so well that the same people who criticized it so fiercely now cite it as an excuse not to support the broader accord.  Think about that.  What was once proclaimed as a historic mistake is now held up as a success and a reason to not sign the comprehensive deal.  So keep that in mind when you assess the credibility of the arguments being made against diplomacy today.  Despite the criticism, we moved ahead to negotiate a more lasting, comprehensive deal.  Our diplomats, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, kept our coalition united.  Our nuclear experts -- including one of the best in the world, Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz -- worked tirelessly on the technical details.  In July, we reached a comprehensive plan of action that meets our objectives.  Under its terms, Iran is never allowed to build a nuclear weapon.  And while Iran, like any party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is allowed to access peaceful nuclear energy, the agreement strictly defines the manner in which its nuclear program can proceed, ensuring that all pathways to a bomb are cut off.   Heres how:  Under this deal, Iran cannot acquire the plutonium needed for a bomb.  The core of its heavy-water reactor at Arak will be pulled out, filled with concrete, and replaced with one that will not produce plutonium for a weapon.  The spent fuel from that reactor will be shipped out of the country, and Iran will not build any new heavy-water reactors for at least 15 years.  Iran will also not be able to acquire the enriched uranium that could be used for a bomb.  As soon as this deal is implemented, Iran will remove two-thirds of its centrifuges.  For the next decade, Iran will not enrich uranium with its more advanced centrifuges.  Iran will not enrich uranium at the previously undisclosed Fordow facility, which is buried deep underground, for at least 15 years.  Iran will get rid of 98 percent of its stockpile of enriched uranium, which is currently enough for up to 10 nuclear bombs, for the next 15 years.  Even after those 15 years have passed, Iran will never have the right to use a peaceful program as cover to pursue a weapon.  And, in fact, this deal shuts off the type of covert path Iran pursued in the past.  There will be 24/7 monitoring of Irans key nuclear facilities.  For decades, inspectors will have access to Irans entire nuclear supply chain -- from the uranium mines and mills where they get raw materials, to the centrifuge production facilities where they make machines to enrich it.  And understand why this is so important:  For Iran to cheat, it has to build a lot more than just one building or a covert facility like Fordow.  It would need a secret source for every single aspect of its program.  No nation in history has been able to pull off such subterfuge when subjected to such rigorous inspections.  And under the terms of the deal, inspectors will have the permanent ability to inspect any suspicious sites in Iran.   And finally, Iran has powerful incentives to keep its commitments.  Before getting sanctions relief, Iran has to take significant, concrete steps like removing centrifuges and getting rid of its stockpile.  If Iran violates the agreement over the next decade, all of the sanctions can snap back into place.  We wont need the support of other members of the U.N. Security Council; America can trigger snapback on our own.  On the other hand, if Iran abides by the deal and its economy begins to reintegrate with the world, the incentive to avoid snapback will only grow.  So this deal is not just the best choice among alternatives - this is the strongest non-proliferation agreement ever negotiated.  And because this is such a strong deal, every nation in the world that has commented publicly, with the exception of the Israeli government1, has expressed support.  The United Nations Security Council has unanimously supported it.  The majority of arms control and non-proliferation experts support it.  Over 100 former ambassadors -- who served under Republican and Democratic Presidents -- support it.  Ive had to make a lot of tough calls as President, but whether or not this deal is good for American security is not one of those calls.  Its not even close.   Unfortunately, were living through a time in American politics where every foreign policy decision is viewed through a partisan prism, evaluated by headline-grabbing sound bites. And so before the ink was even dry on this deal -- before Congress even read it -- a majority of Republicans declared their virulent opposition.  Lobbyists and pundits were suddenly transformed into arm-chair nuclear scientists, disputing the assessments of experts like Secretary Moniz, challenging his findings, offering multiple -- and sometimes contradictory -- arguments about why Congress should reject this deal.  But if you repeat these arguments long enough, they can get some traction.  So let me address just a few of the arguments that have been made so far in opposition to this deal.  First, there are those who say the inspections are not strong enough because inspectors cant go anywhere in Iran at any time with no notice.  Well, heres the truth:  Inspectors will be allowed daily access to Irans key nuclear sites.  If there is a reason for inspecting a suspicious, undeclared site anywhere in Iran, inspectors will get that access, even if Iran objects.  This access can be with as little as 24 hours notice.  And while the process for resolving a dispute about access can take up to 24 days, once weve identified a site that raises suspicion, we will be watching it continuously until inspectors get in.  And by the way, nuclear material isnt something you hide in the closet.  It can leave a trace for years.  The bottom line is, if Iran cheats, we can catch them -- and we will.   Second, there are those who argue that the deal isnt strong enough because some of the limitations on Irans civilian nuclear program expire in 15 years.  Let me repeat:  The prohibition on Iran having a nuclear weapon is permanent.  The ban on weapons-related research is permanent.  Inspections are permanent.  It is true that some of the limitations regarding Irans peaceful program last only 15 years.  But thats how arms control agreements work.  The first SALT Treaty with the Soviet Union lasted five years.  The first START Treaty lasted 15 years.  And in our current situation, if 15 or 20 years from now, Iran tries to build a bomb, this deal ensures that the United States will have better tools to detect it, a stronger basis under international law to respond, and the same options available to stop a weapons program as we have today, including -- if necessary -- military options. On the other hand, without this deal, the scenarios that critics warn about happening in 15 years could happen six months from now.  By killing this deal, Congress would not merely pave Irans pathway to a bomb, it would accelerate it.   Third, a number of critics say the deal isnt worth it because Iran will get billions of dollars in sanctions relief.  Now, lets be clear:  The international sanctions were put in place precisely to get Iran to agree to constraints on its program.  That's the point of sanctions.  Any negotiated agreement with Iran would involve sanctions relief.  So an argument against sanctions relief is effectively an argument against any diplomatic resolution of this issue. It is true that if Iran lives up to its commitments, it will gain access to roughly 56 billion dollars of its own money -- revenue frozen overseas by other countries.  But the notion that this will be a game-changer, with all this money funneled into Irans pernicious activities, misses the reality of Irans current situation.  Partly because of our sanctions, the Iranian government has over half a trillion dollars in urgent requirements -- from funding pensions and salaries, to paying for crumbling infrastructure.  Irans leaders have raised the expectations of their people that sanctions relief will improve their lives.  Even a repressive regime like Irans cannot completely ignore those expectations.  And thats why our best analysts expect the bulk of this revenue to go into spending that improves the economy and benefits the lives of the Iranian people.  Now, this is not to say that sanctions relief will provide no benefit to Irans military.  Lets stipulate that some of that money will flow to activities that we object to.  We have no illusions about the Iranian government, or the significance of the Revolutionary Guard and the Quds Force.  Iran supports terrorist organizations like Hezbollah.  It supports proxy groups that threaten our interests and the interests of our allies -- including proxy groups who killed our troops in Iraq.  They try to destabilize our Gulf partners.  But Iran has been engaged in these activities for decades.  They engaged in them before sanctions and while sanctions were in place.  In fact, Iran even engaged in these activities in the middle of the Iran-Iraq War -- a war that cost them nearly a million lives and hundreds of billions of dollars.   The truth is that Iran has always found a way to fund these efforts, and whatever benefit Iran may claim from sanctions relief pales in comparison to the danger it could pose with a nuclear weapon.  Moreover, theres no scenario where sanctions relief turns Iran into the regions dominant power.  Irans defense budget is eight times smaller than the combined budget of our Gulf allies. Their conventional capabilities will never compare with Israels, and our commitment to Israels qualitative military edge helps guarantee that.  Over the last several years, Iran has had to spend billions of dollars to support its only ally in the Arab World -- Bashar al-Assad -- even as hes lost control of huge chunks of his country.  And Hezbollah has suffered significant blows on the same battlefield.  And Iran, like the rest of the region, is being forced to respond to the threat of ISIL in Iraq.   So contrary to the alarmists who claim that Iran is on the brink of taking over the Middle East, or even the world, Iran will remain a regional power with its own set of challenges.  The ruling regime is dangerous and it is repressive.  We will continue to have sanctions in place on Irans support for terrorism and violation of human rights.  We will continue to insist upon the release of Americans detained unjustly.  We will have a lot of differences with the Iranian regime.  But if were serious about confronting Irans destabilizing activities, it is hard to imagine a worse approach than blocking this deal.  Instead, we need to check the behavior that we're concerned about directly:  By helping our allies in the region strengthen their own capabilities to counter a cyber-attack or a ballistic missile; by improving the interdiction of weapons shipments that go to groups like Hezbollah; by training our allies special forces so that they can more effectively respond to situations like Yemen.  All these capabilities will make a difference.  We will be in a stronger position to implement them with this deal.  And, by the way, such a strategy also helps us effectively confront the immediate and lethal threat posed by ISIL.  Now, the final criticism -- this sort of a catch-all that you may hear -- is the notion that theres a better deal to be had.  We should get a better deal -- thats repeated over and over again.  It's a bad deal, need a better deal -- one that relies on vague promises of toughness, and, more recently, the argument that we can apply a broader and indefinite set of sanctions to squeeze the Iranian regime harder.  Those making this argument are either ignorant of Iranian society, or theyre just not being straight with the American people.  Sanctions alone are not going to force Iran to completely dismantle all vestiges of its nuclear infrastructure -- even those aspects that are consistent with peaceful programs.  That oftentimes is what the critics are calling a better deal.  Neither the Iranian government, or the Iranian opposition, or the Iranian people would agree to what they would view as a total surrender of their sovereignty.  Moreover, our closest allies in Europe, or in Asia -- much less China or Russia -- certainly are not going to agree to enforce existing sanctions for another 5, 10, 15 years according to the dictates of the U.S. Congress.  Because their willingness to support sanctions in the first place was based on Iran ending its pursuit of nuclear weapons.  It was not based on the belief that Iran cannot have peaceful nuclear power.  And it certainly wasnt based on a desire for regime change in Iran.  As a result, those who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy.  Instead of strengthening our position as some have suggested, Congresss rejection would almost certainly result in multilateral sanctions unraveling.  If, as has also been suggested, we tried to maintain unilateral sanctions, beefen them up, we would be standing alone.  We cannot dictate the foreign, economic and energy policies of every major power in the world. In order to even try to do that, we would have to sanction, for example, some of the worlds largest banks.  Wed have to cut off countries like China from the American financial system.  And since they happen to be major purchasers of or our debt, such actions could trigger severe disruptions in our own economy and, by the way, raise questions internationally about the dollars role as the worlds reserve currency.  Thats part of the reason why many of the previous unilateral sanctions were waived.  Whats more likely to happen, should Congress reject this deal, is that Iran would end up with some form of sanctions relief without having to accept any of the constraints or inspections required by this deal.  So in that sense, the critics are right:  Walk away from this agreement and you will get a better deal -- for Iran. Now, because more sanctions wont produce the results that the critics want, we have to be honest.  Congressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. Administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option -- another war in the Middle East.  I say this not to be provocative.  I am stating a fact. Without this deal, Iran will be in a position -- however tough our rhetoric may be - to steadily advance its capabilities.  Its breakout time, which is already fairly small, could shrink to near zero.  Does anyone really doubt that the same voices now raised against this deal will be demanding that whoever is President bomb those nuclear facilities?   And as someone who does firmly believes that Iran must not get a nuclear weapon, and who has wrestled with this issue since the beginning of my presidency, I can tell you that alternatives to military action will have been exhausted once we reject a hard-won diplomatic solution that the world almost unanimously supports.   So lets not mince words.  The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy or some form of war -- maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.  And heres the irony.  As I said before, military action would be far less effective than this deal in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Thats not just my supposition.  Every estimate, including those from Israeli analysts, suggest military action would only set back Irans program by a few years at best, which is a fraction of the limitations imposed by this deal.  It would likely guarantee that inspectors are kicked out of Iran.  It is probable that it would drive Irans program deeper underground.  It would certainly destroy the international unity that weve spent so many years building.  Now, there are some opponents -- I have to give them credit; there are opponents of this deal who accept the choice of war.  In fact, they argue that surgical strikes against Irans facilities will be quick and painless.  But if weve learned anything from the last decade, its that wars in general and wars in the Middle East in particular are anything but simple.  The only certainty in war is human suffering, uncertain costs, unintended consequences.  We can also be sure that the Americans who bear the heaviest burden are the less than 1 percent of us, the outstanding men and women who serve in uniform, and not those of us who send them to war.  As Commander-in-Chief, I have not shied from using force when necessary.  I have ordered tens of thousands of young Americans into combat.  I have sat by their bedside sometimes when they come home.  Ive ordered military action in seven countries.  There are times when force is necessary, and if Iran does not abide by this deal, its possible that we dont have an alternative.  But how can we in good conscience justify war before weve tested a diplomatic agreement that achieves our objectives; that has been agreed to by Iran; that is supported by the rest of the world; and that preserves our options if the deal falls short? How could we justify that to our troops?  How could we justify that to the world or to future generations?", "filename": "05August2015IranNuclearDealAddressatAmericanUniversity.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you.  Well, good morning.  Giving all praise and honor to God.  It is wonderful to be back with you here.  I want to thank our co-chairs, Bob and Roger.  These two don't always agree in the Senate, but in coming together and uniting us all in prayer, they embody the spirit of our gathering today. I also want to thank everybody who helped organize this breakfast.  It's wonderful to see so many friends and faith leaders and dignitaries.  And Michelle and I are truly honored to be joining you here today. I want to offer a special welcome to a good friend, His Holiness the Dalai Lama -- who is a powerful example of what it means to practice compassion, who inspires us to speak up for the freedom and dignity of all human beings.  I've been pleased to welcome him to the White House on many occasions, and we're grateful that he's able to join us here today. There aren't that many occasions that bring His Holiness under the same roof as NASCAR.  This may be the first.  But God works in mysterious ways.  And so I want to thank Darrell [Waltrip] for that wonderful presentation.  Darrell [Waltrip] knows that when you're going 200 miles an hour, a little prayer cannot hurt. I suspect that more than once, Darrell has had the same thought as many of us have in our own lives -- Jesus, take the wheel.  Although I hope that you kept your hands on the wheel when you were thinking that. He and I obviously share something in having married up.  And we are so grateful to Stevie for the incredible work that they've done together to build a ministry where the fastest drivers can slow down a little bit, and spend some time in prayer and reflection and thanks.  And we certainly want to wish Darrell a happy birthday. Happy birthday. I will note, though, Darrell, when you were reading that list of things folks were saying about you, I was thinking, well, you're a piker.  I mean, that --  I mean, if you really want a list, come talk to me. Because that ain't nothing. That's the best they can do in NASCAR? Slowing down and pausing for fellowship and prayer -- that's what this breakfast is about.  I think it's fair to say Washington moves a lot slower than NASCAR.  Certainly my agenda does sometimes. But still, it's easier to get caught up in the rush of our lives, and in the political back-and-forth that can take over this city.  We get sidetracked with distractions, large and small.  We can't go 10 minutes without checking our smartphones -- and for my staff, that's every 10 seconds.  And so for 63 years, this prayer tradition has brought us together, giving us the opportunity to come together in humility before the Almighty and to be reminded of what it is that we share as children of God. And certainly for me, this is always a chance to reflect on my own faith journey.  Many times as President, I've been reminded of a line of prayer that Eleanor Roosevelt was fond of. She said, \"Keep us at tasks too hard for us that we may be driven to Thee for strength.\"  Keep us at tasks too hard for us that we may be driven to Thee for strength.  I've wondered at times if maybe God was answering that prayer a little too literally.  But no matter the challenge, He has been there for all of us.  He's certainly strengthened me \"with the power through his Spirit,\" as I've sought His guidance not just in my own life but in the life of our nation. Now, over the last few months, we've seen a number of challenges -- certainly over the last six years.  But part of what I want to touch on today is the degree to which we've seen professions of faith used both as an instrument of great good, but also twisted and misused in the name of evil. As we speak, around the world, we see faith inspiring people to lift up one another -- to feed the hungry and care for the poor, and comfort the afflicted and make peace where there is strife.  We heard the good work that Sister has done in Philadelphia, and the incredible work that Dr. [Kent] Brantly and his colleagues have done.  We see faith driving us to do right. But we also see faith being twisted and distorted, used as a wedge -- or, worse, sometimes used as a weapon.  From a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violence and terror perpetrated by those who profess to stand up for faith, their faith, professed to stand up for Islam, but, in fact, are betraying it.  We see ISIL, a brutal, vicious death cult that, in the name of religion, carries out unspeakable acts of barbarism  -- terrorizing religious minorities like the Yazidis, subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war, and claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions.  We see sectarian war in Syria, the murder of Muslims and Christians in Nigeria, religious war in the Central African Republic, a rising tide of anti-Semitism and hate crimes in Europe, so often perpetrated in the name of religion. So how do we, as people of faith, reconcile these realities -- the profound good, the strength, the tenacity, the compassion and love that can flow from all of our faiths, operating alongside those who seek to hijack religious for their own murderous ends?  Humanity has been grappling with these questions throughout human history.  And lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place, remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.  In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.  Michelle and I returned from India -- an incredible, beautiful country, full of magnificent diversity -- but a place where, in past years, religious faiths of all types have, on occasion, been targeted by other peoples of faith, simply due to their heritage and their beliefs -- acts of intolerance that would have shocked Gandhiji, the person who helped to liberate that nation.  So this is not unique to one group or one religion.  There is a tendency in us, a sinful tendency that can pervert and distort our faith.  In today's world, when hate groups have their own Twitter accounts and bigotry can fester in hidden places in cyberspace, it can be even harder to counteract such intolerance. But God compels us to try.  And in this mission, I believe there are a few principles that can guide us, particularly those of us who profess to believe.  And, first, we should start with some basic humility.  I believe that the starting point of faith is some doubt -- not being so full of yourself and so confident that you are right and that God speaks only to us, and doesn't speak to others, that God only cares about us and doesn't care about others, that somehow we alone are in possession of the truth. Our job is not to ask that God respond to our notion of Truth -- our job is to be true to Him, His word, and His commandments.  And we should assume humbly that we're confused and don't always know what we're doing and we're staggering and stumbling towards Him, and have some humility in that process.  And that means we have to speak up against those who would misuse His name to justify oppression, or violence, or hatred with that fierce certainty.  No God condones terror.  No grievance justifies the taking of innocent lives, or the oppression of those who are weaker or fewer in number. And so, as people of faith, we are summoned to push back against those who try to distort our religion -- any religion -- for their own nihilistic ends.  And here at home and around the world, we will constantly reaffirm that fundamental freedom -- freedom of religion -- the right to practice our faith how we choose, to change our faith if we choose, to practice no faith at all if we choose, and to do so free of persecution and fear and discrimination. There's wisdom in our founders writing in those documents that help found this nation the notion of freedom of religion, because they understood the need for humility.  They also understood the need to uphold freedom of speech, that there was a connection between freedom of speech and freedom of religion.  For to infringe on one right under the pretext of protecting another is a betrayal of both. But part of humility is also recognizing in modern, complicated, diverse societies, the functioning of these rights, the concern for the protection of these rights calls for each of us to exercise civility and restraint and judgment.  And if, in fact, we defend the legal right of a person to insult another's religion, we're equally obligated to use our free speech to condemn such insults -- and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with religious communities, particularly religious minorities who are the targets of such attacks.  Just because you have the right to say something doesn't mean the rest of us shouldn't question those who would insult others in the name of free speech.  Because we know that our nations are stronger when people of all faiths feel that they are welcome, that they, too, are full and equal members of our countries. So humility I think is needed.  And the second thing we need is to uphold the distinction between our faith and our governments: between Church and between State.  The United States is one of the most religious countries in the world -- far more religious than most Western developed countries.  And one of the reasons is that our founders wisely embraced the separation of church and state.  Our government does not sponsor a religion, nor does it pressure anyone to practice a particular faith, or any faith at all.  And the result is a culture where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely and proudly worship, without fear, or coercion -- so that when you listen to Darrell talk about his faith journey you know it's real.  You know he's not saying it because it helps him advance, or because somebody told him to.  It's from the heart. That's not the case in theocracies that restrict people's choice of faith.  It's not the case in authoritarian governments that elevate an individual leader or a political party above the people, or in some cases, above the concept of God Himself.  So the freedom of religion is a value we will continue to protect here at home and stand up for around the world, and is one that we guard vigilantly here in the United States. Last year, we joined together to pray for the release of Christian missionary Kenneth Bae, held in North Korea for two years.  And today, we give thanks that Kenneth is finally back where he belongs -- home, with his family.  Last year, we prayed together for Pastor Saeed Abedini, detained in Iran since 2012.  And I was recently in Boise, Idaho, and had the opportunity to meet with Pastor Abedini's beautiful wife and wonderful children and to convey to them that our country has not forgotten brother Saeed and that we're doing everything we can to bring him home. And then, I received an extraordinary letter from Pastor Abedini.  And in it, he describes his captivity, and expressed his gratitude for my visit with his family, and thanked us all for standing in solidarity with him during his captivity. And Pastor Abedini wrote, Nothing is more valuable to the Body of Christ than to see how the Lord is in control, and moves ahead of countries and leadership through united prayer. And he closed his letter by describing himself as [a] prisoner for Christ, who is proud to be part of this great nation of the United States of America that cares for religious freedom around the world.  We're going to keep up this work -- for Pastor Abedini and all those around the world who are unjustly held or persecuted because of their faith. And we're grateful to our new Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom, Rabbi David Saperstein -- who has hit the ground running, and is heading to Iraq in a few days to help religious communities there address some of those challenges.  Where's David?  I know he's here somewhere.  Thank you, David, for the great work you're doing.  Humility; a suspicion of government getting between us and our faiths, or trying to dictate our faiths, or elevate one faith over another.  And, finally, let's remember that if there is one law that we can all be most certain of that seems to bind people of all faiths, and people who are still finding their way towards faith but have a sense of ethics and morality in them -- that one law, that Golden Rule that we should treat one another as we wish to be treated.  The Torah says \"Love thy neighbor as yourself.\"  In Islam, there is a Hadith that states: \"None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.\"  The Holy Bible tells us to \"put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.\"  Put on love. Whatever our beliefs, whatever our traditions, we must seek to be instruments of peace, and bringing light where there is darkness, and sowing love where there is hatred.  And this is the loving message of His Holiness, Pope Francis.  And like so many people around the world, I've been touched by his call to relieve suffering, and to show justice and mercy and compassion to the most vulnerable; to walk with The Lord and ask \"Who am I to judge?", "filename": "05February2015Speechatthe63rdNationalPrayerBreakfast.txt"}, {"question": "I still remember the first time we met, the time we spent together, and the conversation we had about Daniel. And that changed me that day. And my hope, earnestly, has been that it would change the country. Five years ago this week, a sitting member of Congress and 18 others were shot at, at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona. It wasnt the first time I had to talk to the nation in response to a mass shooting, nor would it be the last. Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora. Oak Creek. Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa Barbara. Charleston. San Bernardino. Too many. Audience Member: Too many. Audience Member: Too many. Audience Member: Too many. President Obama: Thanks to a great medical team and the love of her husband, Mark, my dear friend and colleague, Gabby Giffords, survived. Shes here with us today, with her wonderful mom.  Thanks to a great medical team, her wonderful husband, Mark -- who, by the way, the last time I met with Mark -- this is just a small aside -- you may know Marks twin brother is in outer space.  He came to the office, and I said, how often are you talking to him? And he says, well, I usually talk to him every day, but the call was coming in right before the meeting so I think I may have not answered his call -- which made me feel kind of bad.  Thats a long-distance call.  So I told him if his brother, Scott, is calling today, that he should take it.  Turn the ringer on.  I was there with Gabby when she was still in the hospital, and we didnt think necessarily at that point that she was going to survive. And that visit right before a memorial -- about an hour later Gabby first opened her eyes. And I remember talking to mom about that. But I know the pain that she and her family have endured these past five years, and the rehabilitation and the work and the effort to recover from shattering injuries. And then I think of all the Americans who arent as fortunate. Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns -- 30,000. Suicides. Domestic violence. Gang shootouts. Accidents. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost brothers and sisters, or buried their own children. Many have had to learn to live with a disability, or learned to live without the love of their life. A number of those people are here today. They can tell you some stories. In this room right here, there are a lot of stories. Theres a lot of heartache. Theres a lot of resilience, theres a lot of strength, but theres also a lot of pain. And this is just a small sample. The United States of America is not the only country on Earth with violent or dangerous people. We are not inherently more prone to violence. But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency. It doesnt happen in other advanced countries. Its not even close. And as Ive said before, somehow weve become numb to it and we start thinking that this is normal. And instead of thinking about how to solve the problem, this has become one of our most polarized, partisan debates -- despite the fact that theres a general consensus in America about what needs to be done. Thats part of the reason why, on Thursday, Im going to hold a town hall meeting in Virginia on gun violence. Because my goal here is to bring good people on both sides of this issue together for an open discussion. Im not on the ballot again. Im not looking to score some points. I think we can disagree without impugning other peoples motives or without being disagreeable. We dont need to be talking past one another. But we do have to feel a sense of urgency about it. In Dr. Kings words1, we need to feel the fierce urgency of now. Because people are dying. And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do, no longer suffice. Thats why were here today. Not to debate the last mass shooting, but to do something to try to prevent the next one.  To prove that the vast majority of Americans, even if our voices arent always the loudest or most extreme, care enough about a little boy like Daniel to come together and take common-sense steps to save lives and protect more of our children. Now, I want to be absolutely clear at the start -- and Ive said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that I have to do -- I believe in the Second Amendment. Its there written on the paper. It guarantees a right to bear arms. No matter how many times people try to twist my words around -- I taught constitutional law, I know a little about this -- I get it. But I also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment. I mean, think about it. We all believe in the First Amendment, the guarantee of free speech, but we accept that you cant yell fire in a theater. We understand there are some constraints on our freedom in order to protect innocent people. We cherish our right to privacy, but we accept that you have to go through metal detectors before being allowed to board a plane. Its not because people like doing that, but we understand that thats part of the price of living in a civilized society. And whats often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners actually agree. A majority of gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking feud from inflicting harm on a massive scale. Today, background checks are required at gun stores. If a father wants to teach his daughter how to hunt, he can walk into a gun store, get a background check, purchase his weapon safely and responsibly. This is not seen as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Contrary to the claims of what some gun rights proponents have suggested, this hasnt been the first step in some slippery slope to mass confiscation. Contrary to claims of some presidential candidates, apparently, before this meeting, this is not a plot to take away everybodys guns. You pass a background check; you purchase a firearm. The problem is some gun sellers have been operating under a different set of rules. A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the Internet with no background check, no questions asked. A recent study found that about one in 30 people looking to buy guns on one website had criminal records -- one out of 30 had a criminal record. Were talking about individuals convicted of serious crimes -- aggravated assault, domestic violence, robbery, illegal gun possession. People with lengthy criminal histories buying deadly weapons all too easily. And this was just one website within the span of a few months. So weve created a system in which dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules than a responsible gun owner who buys his or her gun the right way and subjects themselves to a background check. That doesnt make sense. Everybody should have to abide by the same rules. Most Americans and gun owners agree. And thats what we tried to change three years ago, after 26 Americans - including 20 children - were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary. Two United States Senators - Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania, both gun owners, both strong defenders of our Second Amendment rights, both with A grades from the NRA - thats hard to get -- worked together in good faith, consulting with folks like our Vice President, who has been a champion on this for a long time, to write a common-sense compromise bill that would have required virtually everyone who buys a gun to get a background check. That was it. Pretty common-sense stuff. Ninety percent of Americans supported that idea. Ninety percent of Democrats in the Senate voted for that idea. But it failed because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate voted against that idea. How did this become such a partisan issue? Republican President George W. Bush once said, I believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns dont get into the hands of people that shouldnt have them. Senator John McCain introduced a bipartisan measure to address the gun show loophole, saying, We need this amendment because criminals and terrorists have exploited and are exploiting this very obvious loophole in our gun safety laws. Even the NRA used to support expanded background checks. And by the way, most of its members still do. Most Republican voters still do. How did we get here? How did we get to the place where people think requiring a comprehensive background check means taking away peoples guns? Each time this comes up, we are fed the excuse that common-sense reforms like background checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before that, or the one before that, so why bother trying. I reject that thinking.  We know we cant stop every act of violence, every act of evil in the world. But maybe we could try to stop one act of evil, one act of violence. Some of you may recall, at the same time that Sandy Hook happened, a disturbed person in China took a knife and tried to kill -- with a knife -- a bunch of children in China. But most of them survived because he didnt have access to a powerful weapon. We maybe cant save everybody, but we could save some. Just as we dont prevent all traffic accidents but we take steps to try to reduce traffic accidents. As Ronald Reagan once said, if mandatory background checks could save more lives, it would be well worth making it the law of the land. The bill before Congress three years ago met that test. Unfortunately, too many senators failed theirs.  In fact, we know that background checks make a difference. After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40 percent -- 40 percent.  Meanwhile, since Missouri repealed a law requiring comprehensive background checks and purchase permits, gun deaths have increased to almost 50 percent higher than the national average. One study found, unsurprisingly, that criminals in Missouri now have easier access to guns. And the evidence tells us that in states that require background checks, law-abiding Americans dont find it any harder to purchase guns whatsoever. Their guns have not been confiscated. Their rights have not been infringed. And thats just the information we have access to. With more research, we could further improve gun safety. Just as with more research, weve reduced traffic fatalities enormously over the last 30 years. We do research when cars, food, medicine, even toys harm people so that we make them safer. And you know what -- research, science -- those are good things. They work.  They do. But think about this. When it comes to an inherently deadly weapon -- nobody argues that guns are potentially deadly -- weapons that kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, Congress actually voted to make it harder for public health experts to conduct research into gun violence; made it harder to collect data and facts and develop strategies to reduce gun violence. Even after San Bernardino, theyve refused to make it harder for terror suspects who cant get on a plane to buy semi-automatic weapons. Thats not right. That cant be right. So the gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage right now, but they cannot hold America hostage.  We do not have to accept this carnage as the price of freedom. Now, I want to be clear. Congress still needs to act. The folks in this room will not rest until Congress does.  Because once Congress gets on board with common-sense gun safety measures we can reduce gun violence a whole lot more. But we also cant wait. Until we have a Congress thats in line with the majority of Americans, there are actions within my legal authority that we can take to help reduce gun violence and save more lives - actions that protect our rights and our kids. After Sandy Hook, Joe and I worked together with our teams and we put forward a whole series of executive actions to try to tighten up the existing rules and systems that we had in place. But today, we want to take it a step further. So let me outline what were going to be doing. Number one, anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks, or be subject to criminal prosecutions.  It doesnt matter whether youre doing it over the Internet or at a gun show. Its not where you do it, but what you do. Were also expanding background checks to cover violent criminals who try to buy some of the most dangerous firearms by hiding behind trusts and corporations and various cutouts. Were also taking steps to make the background check system more efficient. Under the guidance of Jim Comey and the FBI, our Deputy Director Tom Brandon at ATF, were going to hire more folks to process applications faster, and were going to bring an outdated background check system into the 21st century.  And these steps will actually lead to a smoother process for law-abiding gun owners, a smoother process for responsible gun dealers, a stronger process for protecting the people from -- the public from dangerous people. So thats number one. Number two, were going to do everything we can to ensure the smart and effective enforcement of gun safety laws that are already on the books, which means were going to add 200 more ATF agents and investigators. Were going to require firearms dealers to report more lost or stolen guns on a timely basis. Were working with advocates to protect victims of domestic abuse from gun violence, where too often -- where too often, people are not getting the protection that they need. Number three, were going to do more to help those suffering from mental illness get the help that they need.  High-profile mass shootings tend to shine a light on those few mentally unstable people who inflict harm on others. But the truth is, is that nearly two in three gun deaths are from suicides. So a lot of our work is to prevent people from hurting themselves. Thats why we made sure that the Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- that law made sure that treatment for mental health was covered the same as treatment for any other illness. And thats why were going to invest $500 million to expand access to treatment across the country.  Its also why were going to ensure that federal mental health records are submitted to the background check system, and remove barriers that prevent states from reporting relevant information. If we can continue to de-stigmatize mental health issues, get folks proper care, and fill gaps in the background check system, then we can spare more families the pain of losing a loved one to suicide. And for those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as a way of avoiding action on guns, heres your chance to support these efforts. Put your money where your mouth is.  Number four, were going to boost gun safety technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen or misused or discharged accidentally. In 2013 alone, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents - and that includes 30 children younger than five years old. In the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on Earth, there is no reason for this. We need to develop new technologies that make guns safer. If we can set it up so you cant unlock your phone unless youve got the right fingerprint, why cant we do the same thing for our guns?  If theres an app that can help us find a missing tablet -- which happens to me often the older I get -- if we can do it for your iPad, theres no reason we cant do it with a stolen gun. If a child cant open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure that they cant pull a trigger on a gun.  Right?", "filename": "05January2016SpeechDetailingStepstoReduceGunViolence.txt"}, {"question": "Today, I had a chance to speak with John Boehner and congratulated Mitch McConnell on becoming the next Senate Majority Leader.  And I told them both that I look forward to finishing up this Congress business, and then working together for the next two years to advance Americas business.  And I very much appreciated Leader McConnells words last night about the prospect of working together to deliver for the American people. On Friday, I look forward to hosting the entire Republican and Democratic leadership at the White House to chart a new course forward. Obviously, Republicans had a good night, and they deserve credit for running good campaigns.  Beyond that, Ill leave it to all of you and the professional pundits to pick through yesterdays results.  What stands out to me, though, is that the American people sent a message, one that theyve sent for several elections now.  They expect the people they elect to work as hard as they do.  They expect us to focus on their ambitions and not ours.  They want us to get the job done. All of us, in both parties, have a responsibility to address that sentiment.  Still, as President, I have a unique responsibility to try and make this town work.  So, to everyone who voted, I want you to know that I hear you.  To the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you, too.  All of us have to give more Americans a reason to feel like the ground is stable beneath their feet, that the future is secure, that theres a path for young people to succeed, and that folks here in Washington are concerned about them.  So I plan on spending every moment of the next two-plus years doing my job the best I can to keep this country safe and to make sure that more Americans share in its prosperity. This country has made real progress since the crisis six years ago.  The fact is more Americans are working; unemployment has come down.  More Americans have health insurance.  Manufacturing has grown.  Our deficits have shrunk.  Our dependence on foreign oil is down, as are gas prices.  Our graduation rates are up.  Our businesses arent just creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s, our economy is outpacing most of the world.  But weve just got to keep at it until every American feels the gains of a growing economy where it matters most, and that's in their own lives. Obviously, much of that will take action from Congress.  And Im eager to work with the new Congress to make the next two years as productive as possible.  I'm committed to making sure that I measure ideas not by whether they are from Democrats or Republicans, but whether they work for the American people.  And thats not to say that we wont disagree over some issues that were passionate about.  We will.  Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign.  I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like.  Thats natural.  That's how our democracy works.  But we can surely find ways to work together on issues where theres broad agreement among the American people. So I look forward to Republicans putting forward their governing agenda.  I will offer my ideas on areas where I think we can move together to respond to peoples economic needs. So, just take one example.  We all agree on the need to create more jobs that pay well.  Traditionally, both parties have been for creating jobs rebuilding our infrastructure -- our roads, bridges, ports, waterways.  I think we can hone in on a way to pay for it through tax reform that closes loopholes and makes it more attractive for companies to create jobs here in the United States. We can also work together to grow our exports and open new markets for our manufacturers to sell more American-made goods to the rest of the world.  That's something Ill be focused on when I travel to Asia next week. We all share the same aspirations for our young people.  And I was encouraged that this year Republicans agreed to investments that expanded early childhood education.  I think we've got a chance to do more on that front.  Weve got some common ideas to help more young people afford college and graduate without crippling debt so that they have the freedom to fill the good jobs of tomorrow and buy their first homes and start a family. And in the five states where a minimum wage increase was on the ballot last night, voters went five for five to increase it. That will give about 325,000 Americans a raise in states where Republican candidates prevailed.  So that should give us new reason to get it done for everybody, with a national increase in the minimum wage. So those are some areas where I think we've got some real opportunities to cooperate.  And I am very eager to hear Republican ideas for what they think we can do together over the next couple of years.  Of course, theres still business on the docket that needs attention this year.  And here are three places where I think we can work together over the next several weeks, before this Congress wraps up for the holidays. First, Im submitting a request to Congress for funding to ensure that our doctors, scientists, and troops have the resources that they need to combat the spread of Ebola in Africa and to increase our preparedness for any future cases here at home. Second, I'm going to begin engaging Congress over a new Authorization to Use Military Force against ISIL.  The world needs to know we are united behind this effort, and the men and women of our military deserve our clear and unified support. Third, back in September, Congress passed short-term legislation to keep the government open and operating into December.  That gives Congress five weeks to pass a budget for the rest of the fiscal year.  And I hope that theyll do it in the same bipartisan, drama-free way that they did earlier this year.  When our companies are steadily creating jobs -- which they are -- we dont want to inject any new uncertainty into the world economy and to the American economy. The point is its time for us to take care of business.  There are things this country has to do that cant wait another two years or another four years.  There are plans this country has to put in place for our future. And the truth is Im optimistic about our future.  I have good reason to be.  I meet Americans all across the country who are determined, and big-hearted, and ask what they can do, and never give up, and overcome obstacles.  And they inspire me every single day.  So the fact is I still believe in what I said when I was first elected six years ago last night.  For all the maps plastered across our TV screens today, and for all the cynics who say otherwise, I continue to believe we are simply more than just a collection of red and blue states.  We are the United States. And whether it's immigration or climate change, or making sure our kids are going to the best possible schools, to making sure that our communities are creating jobs; whether it's stopping the spread of terror and disease, to opening up doors of opportunity to everybody whos willing to work hard and take responsibility -- the United States has big things to do.  We can and we will make progress if we do it together.  And I look forward to the work ahead. So, with that, let me take some questions.  I think that our team has got my list.  And we're going to start with Julie Pace at Associated Press. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You said during this election that while your name wasnt on the ballot, your policies were.  And despite the optimism that youre expressing here, last night was a devastating night for your party.  Given that, do you feel any responsibility to recalibrate your agenda for the next two years?  And what changes do you need to make in your White House and in your dealings with Republicans in order to address the concerns that voters expressed with your administration? President Obama:  Well, as I said in my opening remarks, the American people overwhelmingly believe that this town doesnt work well and that it is not attentive to their needs.  And as President, they, rightly, hold me accountable to do more to make it work properly.  Im the guy whos elected by everybody, not just from a particular state or a particular district.  And they want me to push hard to close some of these divisions, break through some of the gridlock, and get stuff done.  So the most important thing I can do is just get stuff done, and help Congress get some things done.  In terms of agenda items, though, Julie, if you look, as I just mentioned, to a minimum wage increase, for example, thats something I talked about a lot during the campaign.  Where voters had a chance to vote directly on that agenda item, they voted for it.  And so I think it would be hard to suggest that people arent supportive of it.  We know that the surveys consistently say they want to see that happen.  The key is to find areas where the agenda that Ive put forward, one that I believe will help strengthen the middle class and create more ladders of opportunity into the middle class, and improve our schools, and make college more affordable to more young people, and make sure that were growing faster as an economy and we stay competitive -- the key is to make sure that those ideas that I have overlap somewhere with some of the ideas that Republicans have.  Theres not going to be perfect overlap.  I mean, there are going to be some ideas that Ive got that I think the evidence backs up would be good for the economy; and Republicans disagree. Theyre not going to support those ideas.  But Im going to keep on arguing for them because I think theyre the right thing for the country to do.  There are going to be some ideas that theyve got that they believe will improve the economy or create jobs that, from my perspective, isnt going to help middle-class families improve their economic situation, so I probably wont support theirs.  But I do think there are going to be areas where we do agree -- on infrastructure, on making sure that were boosting American exports.  And part of my task then is to reach out to Republicans, make sure that Im listening to them.  Im looking forward to them putting forward a very specific agenda in terms of what they would like to accomplish.  Lets compare notes in terms of what Im looking at and what theyre looking at, and lets get started on those things where we agree.  Even if we dont agree 100 percent, lets get started on those things where we agree 70, 80, 90 percent.  And if we can do that, and build up some trust and improve how processes work in Washington, then I think thats going to give the American people a little bit more confidence that, in fact, their government is looking after them. Question:  But is there anything specific that you feel like you and your administration need to change given this disastrous election for your party and the message that voters sent? President Obama:  Julie, I think every single day Im looking for, how can we do what we need to do better.  Whether that is delivering basic services the government provides to the American people; whether that is our capacity to work with Congress so that theyre passing legislation; whether its how we communicate with the American people about what our priorities and vision is -- we are constantly asking ourselves questions about how do we make sure that were doing a better job.  And thats not going to stop.  I think that every election is a moment for reflection, and I think that everybody in this White House is going to look and say, all right, what do we need to do differently. But the principles that were fighting for, the things that motivate me every single day and motivate my staff every day -- those things arent going to change.  Theres going to be a consistent focus on how do we deliver more opportunity to more people in this country; how do we grow the economy faster; how do we put more people back to work. And I maybe have a nave confidence that if we continue to focus on the American people, and not on our own ambitions or image or various concerns like that, that at the end of the day, when I look back, Im going to be able to say the American people are better off than they were before I was President.  And thats my most important goal. But the other thing I just want to emphasize is Im -- Ive said this before, I want to reiterate it -- if there are ideas that the Republicans have that I have confidence will make things better for ordinary Americans, the fact that the Republicans suggesting it as opposed to a Democrat, that will be irrelevant to me.  I want to just see what works. And there are some things like rebuilding our infrastructure or early childhood education that we know works.  And Im hoping that the kind of attitude and approach that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner have already expressed, their desire to get things done, allows us to find some common ground. Jeff Mason. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  In 2010, you called the result of the midterm election a shellacking.  What do you call this?  And can you give us an update on your feelings about the immigration executive order in the result -- in the aftermath of this election?  Does the election affect your plans to release it?  Will it still -- is it likely to come out before the lame duck session is over?  And have you reduced its scope to just a couple million people?  President Obama:  Well, as I said in my opening statement, theres no doubt that Republicans had a good night.  And what were going to make sure that we do is to reach out to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, who are now running both chambers in Congress, and find out what their agenda is.  And my hope is, is that theyve got some specific things they want to do that correspond with some things that we want to get done. Whats most important to the American people right now, the resounding message not just of this election, but basically the last several is:  Get stuff done.  Don't worry about the next election.  Don't worry about party affiliation.  Do worry about our concerns.  Worry about the fact that Im a single mom, and at the end of the month its really hard for me to pay the bills, in part because Ive got these huge child care costs. Do worry about the fact that Im a young person whos qualified to go to college, but Im really worried about taking $50,000 a year out in debt and I don't know how Id pay that back. Do worry about the fact that Im a construction worker who has been working all my life, and I know that theres construction work that should be done, but right now, for some reason, projects are stalled. If we're thinking about those folks I think we're, hopefully, going to be able to get some stuff done. In terms of immigration, I have consistently said that it is my profound preference and interest to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would strengthen our borders; would streamline our legal immigration system so that it works better and we're attracting the best and the brightest from around the world; and that we give an opportunity for folks whove lived here, in many cases, for a very long time, may have kids who are U.S. citizens, but arent properly documented -- give them a chance to pay their back taxes, get in the back of the line, but get through a process that allows them to get legal. The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed a good bill.  It wasnt perfect, it wasnt exactly what I wanted, but it was a sound, smart, piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system but our economy, and would improve business conditions here in the United States -- and make sure that American-born workers arent undercut by workers who are undocumented and arent always paid a fair wage and, as a consequence, employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing. So we got a bipartisan bill out of the Senate.  I asked John Boehner at that point, can we pass this through the House?  Theres a majority of votes in the House to get this passed.  And Speaker Boehner I think was sincere about wanting to pass it, but had difficulty over the last year trying to get it done.  So when he finally told me he wasnt going to call it up this year, what I indicated to him is I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse, but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by action by Congress.  You send me a bill that I can sign, and those executive actions go away.  That's a commitment I made not just to the American people  -- and to businesses and the evangelical community and the law enforcement folks and everybody whos looked at this issue and thinks that we need immigration reform -- that's a commitment that I also made to John Boehner, that I would act in the absence of action by Congress. So before the end of the year, we're going to take whatever lawful actions that I can take that I believe will improve the functioning of our immigration system that will allow us to surge additional resources to the border, where I think the vast majority of Americans have the deepest concern.  And at the same time, Ill be reaching out to both Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and other Republican as well as Democratic leaders to find out how it is that they want to proceed.  And if they want to get a bill done -- whether its during the lame duck or next year -- I'm eager to see what they have to offer.  But what Im not going to do is just wait.  I think its fair to say that Ive shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible, and Im going to keep on doing so.  But in the meantime, lets figure out what we can do lawfully through executive actions to improve the functioning of the existing system. Question:  How will you make sure that that executive action has teeth if Republicans try to block it by blocking funding?  And can you give us a sense of whether or not you're thinking about  -- President Obama:  Jeff, I think if you want to get into the details of it, I suspect that when I announce that executive action, it will be rife with detail.  And Im sure there will be a lot of follow-up questions.  Chris Jansing.  Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to follow up on a couple of things and start with immigration.  And are you concerned that if you sign an executive order on immigration before the end of the year it will scuttle whatever chances there may be for there to be some sort of compromise on the issues that you talked about?  And I wonder that, given this unhappy electorate, clearly, and they seem to be disappointed with both sides pretty much, why they punished the Democrats more than the Republicans by far. President Obama:  Well, as I said, when it comes to the political analysis, thats your job.  But what is also true is I am the President of the United States, and I think, understandably, people are going to ask for greater accountability and more responsibility from me than from anybody else in this town.  Appropriately so, and I welcome that.  And the commitment that I will make to the American people and the way Ive tried to conduct myself throughout this presidency is that Im going to wake up every single day doing my absolute best to deliver for them.  And there are areas where weve made real progress.  I think economically, I can look back and there is no doubt that almost  -- on almost every measure, we are better off economically than we were when I took office.  But what is also true is there are still a lot of folks out there who are anxious and are hurting and are having trouble making ends meet, or are worried about their childrens future.  And its my job to give them some confidence that this town can work to respond to some of those worries that folks have.  And we havent done a good enough job convincing them of that.  And I understand that.  Theyve been watching Washington over the last two, four years.  What theyve seen is a lot of arguing and a lot of gridlock, but not a lot of concrete actions, at least legislatively, that have made a difference in their lives.  And so weve got to make sure that we do a better job, and Im committed to doing that. On immigration, I know that concerns have been expressed that, well, if you do something through executive actions, even if its within your own authorities, that that will make it harder to pass immigration reform.  I just have to remind everybody Ive heard that argument now for a couple of years.  This is an issue I actually wanted to get done in my first term, and we didnt see legislative action.  And in my second term, I made it my top legislative priority, and we got really good work done by a bipartisan group of senators, but it froze up in the House. And I think that the best way if folks are serious about getting immigration reform done is going ahead and passing a bill and getting it to my desk.  And then the executive actions that I take go away.  Theyre superseded by the law that has passed. And I will engage any member of Congress whos interested in this in how we can shape legislation that will be a significant improvement over the existing system.  But what we cant do is just keep on waiting.  There is a cost to waiting.  Theres a cost to our economy.  It means that resources are misallocated.  When the issue of unaccompanied children cropped up during this summer, there was a lot of folks who perceived this as a major crisis in our immigration system.  Now, the fact is, is that those numbers have now come down and theyre approximately where they were a year ago or two years ago or a year before that.  But it did identify a real problem in a certain portion of the border where we got to get more resources.  But those resources may be misallocated, separating families right now that most of us, most Americans would say probably wed rather have them just pay their back taxes, pay a fine, learn English, get to the back of the line, but well give you a pathway where you can be legal in this country. So where Ive got executive authorities to do that, we should get started on that.  But I want to emphasize once again, if, in fact, Republican leadership wants to see an immigration bill passed, they now have the capacity to pass it.  And hopefully engaging with me and Democrats in both the House and the Senate, its a bill that I can sign because it addresses the real concerns that are out there.  And the sooner they do it, from my perspective, the better. Jonathan Karl. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Mitch McConnell has been the Republican Leader for six years, as long as youve been President.  But his office tells me that he has only met with you one-on-one once or twice during that entire six-year period.  So Im wondering, as somebody who came to Washington promising to end the hyper-partisanship that was here long before you became President but has gotten worse since you got here, was it a mistake for you to do so little to develop relationships with Republicans in Congress? President Obama:  I think that every day Im asking myself, are there some things I can do better.  And Im going to keep on asking that every single day.  The fact is that most of my interactions with members of Congress have been cordial and theyve been constructive.  Oftentimes, though, we just havent been able to actually get whats discussed in a leadership meeting through caucuses in the House and the Senate to deliver a bill. The good news is that now Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are from the same party; I think they can come together and decide what their agenda is.  Theyve got sufficient majorities to make real progress on some of these issues.  And Im certainly going to be spending a lot more time with them now because thats the only way that were going to be able to get some stuff done.  And I take them at their word that they want to produce.  Theyre in the majority; they need to present their agenda.  I need to put forward my best ideas.  I think the American people are going to be able to watch us and theyre paying attention to see whether or not were serious about actually compromising and being constructive.  And my commitment to them -- and Ive said this when I spoke to them -- is, is that anywhere where we can find common ground, Im eager to pursue it. Question:  Are you going to have that drink with Mitch McConnell now that you joked about at the White House Correspondents Dinner? President Obama:  You know, actually, I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell.  I dont know what his preferred drink is, but -- my interactions with Mitch McConnell, he has always been very straightforward with me. To his credit, he has never made a promise that he couldnt deliver.  And he knows the legislative process well.  He obviously knows his caucus well -- he has always given me, I think, realistic assessments of what he can get through his caucus and what he cant.  And so I think we can have a productive relationship. Phil Mattingly. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Another deadline coming up is your negotiators by November 24th have to figure out if theyre going to reach a deal with Iran on a nuclear area, a nuclear agreement.  Im interested what your current perspective is on how those negotiations are going.  Also if it is your feeling that you have the power to implement any type of agreement that's reached without any action from Congress?  And then, also I just wanted to quickly touch on the AUMF that you mentioned earlier.  Is that going to be more of a codification of the limits that you've put in place for the mission up to this point?  Or what should we be looking for on that when you send it to the Hill?  Thank you. President Obama:  On the AUMF, the leaders are going to be coming here on Friday.  It will be an expanded group, not just the four leaders, but a larger group who all have an interest in the issues we're discussing today.  And Im actually going to invite Lloyd Austin, the CENTCOM Commander, to make a presentation about how our fight against ISIL is proceeding and I think to answer questions and assure that Congress is fully briefed on what we're doing there. With respect to the AUMF, weve already had conversations with members of both parties in Congress, and the idea is to right-size and update whatever authorization Congress provides to suit the current fight, rather than previous fights.  In 2001, after the heartbreaking tragedy of 9/11, we had a very specific set of missions that we had to conduct, and the AUMF was designed to pursue those missions.  With respect to Iraq, there was a very specific AUMF. We now have a different type of enemy.  The strategy is different.  How we partner with Iraq and other Gulf countries and the international coalition -- that has to be structured differently.  So it makes sense for us to make sure that the authorization from Congress reflects what we perceive to be not just our strategy over the next two or three months, but our strategy going forward. And it will be a process of listening to members of Congress, as well as us presenting what we think needs to be the set of authorities that we have.  And Im confident we're going to be able to get that done.  And that may just be a process of us getting it started now.  It may carry over into the next Congress. On Iran, because of the unprecedented sanctions that we put in place that really did have a crippling effect on Irans economy, theyve come to the table and theyve negotiated seriously around providing assurances that they're not developing a nuclear weapon for the first time.  And they have abided by the interim rules.  We have been able to freeze their program, in some cases reduce the stockpile of nuclear material that they already had in hand.  And the discussions, the negotiations have been constructive.  The international community has been unified and cohesive.  There havent been a lot of cracks in our alliance.  Even countries where we have some differences, like Russia, have agreed with us and have worked with us cooperatively in trying to find ways to make sure that we can verify and have confidence going forward that Iran doesn't have the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon that could not only threaten friends of ours like Israel, trigger a nuclear arms race in the region, but could over the long term, potentially threaten us. Whether we can actually get a deal done, were going to have to find out over the next three to four weeks.  We have presented to them a framework that would allow them to meet their peaceful energy needs.  And if, in fact, what their leadership says, that they dont want to develop a nuclear a weapon -- if that is, in fact, true, then theyve got an avenue here to provide that assurance to the world community, and in a progressive, step-by-step, verifiable way, allow them to get out from under sanctions so that they can reenter as full-fledged members of the international community. But they have their own politics, and theres a long tradition of mistrust between the two countries.  And theres a sizeable portion of the political elite that cut its teeth on anti-Americanism and still finds it convenient to blame America for every ill that there is.  And whether they can manage to say yes to what clearly would be better for Iran, better for the region, and better for the world, is an open question.  Well find out over the next several weeks. Question:  Sir, on whether or not you have the power unilaterally to relax sanctions to implement an agreement? President Obama:  There are a series of different sanctions.  There are multilateral sanctions; there are U.N. sanctions;  there are sanctions that have been imposed by us, this administration, unilaterally.  And I think its different for each of those areas. But I dont want to put the cart before the horse.  What I want to do is see if we, in fact, have a deal.  If we do have a deal that I have confidence will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and that we can convince the world and the public will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, then it will be time to engage in Congress.  And I think that well be able to make a strong argument to Congress that this is the best way for us to avoid a nuclear Iran; that it will be more effective than any other alternatives we might take, including military action. But that requires it being a good deal.  And Ive said consistently that Id rather have no deal than a bad deal -- because what we dont want to do is lift sanctions and provide Iran legitimacy but not have the verifiable mechanisms to make sure that they dont break out and produce a nuclear weapon. Ed Henry.  I missed you guys.  I haven't done this in a while. Question:  I know, Ive missed you.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I haven't heard you say a specific thing during this news conference that you would do differently.  Youve been asked it a few different ways.  I understand youre going to reach out, but youve talked about doing that before.  Its almost like youre doubling down on the same policies and approach youve had for six years.  So my question is, why not pull a page from the Clinton playbook and admit you have to make a much more dramatic shift in course for these last two years? And on ISIS, there was pretty dramatic setback in the last few days with it appearing that the Syrian rebels have been routed.  There are some Gitmo detainees who have rejoined the battlefield, helping ISIS and other terror groups, is what the reports are suggesting.  So my question is, are we winning? President Obama:  Well, I think its too early to say whether we are winning, because as I said at the outset of the ISIL campaign, this is going to be a long-term plan to solidify the Iraqi government, to solidify their security forces, to make sure that in addition to air cover that they have the capacity to run a ground game that pushes ISIL back from some of the territories that they had taken, that we have a strong international coalition that weve now built, but that they are on the ground providing the training, providing the equipment, providing the supplies that are necessary for Iraqis to fight on behalf of their territory. And what I also said was that in Syria thats been complicated and thats not going to be solved any time soon.  Our focus in Syria is not to solve the entire Syria situation, but rather to isolate the areas in which ISIL can operate.  And there is no doubt that because of the extraordinary bravery of our men and women in uniform, and the precision of our pilots and the strikes that have taken place, that ISIL is in a more vulnerable position and it is more difficult for them to maneuver than it was previously.  Now, theres a specific issue about trying to get a moderate opposition in Syria that can serve as a partner with us on the ground.  Thats always been the hardest piece of business to get done.  There are a lot of opposition groups in Syria along a spectrum from radical jihadists who are our enemies to folks who believe in inclusive democracy, and everything in between.  They fight among each other.  They are fighting the regime.  And what were trying to do is to find a core group that we can work with that we have confidence in, that weve vetted, that can help in regaining territory from ISIL, and then ultimately serve as a responsible party to sit at the table in eventual political negotiations that are probably some ways off in the future.  Thats always been difficult.  As you know, one of the debates has consistently been, should the Obama administration provide more support to the opposition?  Could that have averted some of the problems that are taking place in Syria?  And as Ive said before, part of the challenge is its a messy situation.  This is not a situation where we have one single unified, broad-based, effective, reliable -- Question:  -- the idea that maybe we have to have -- President Obama:  Let me answer the question, Ed.  And so what we are going to continue to test is, can we get a more stable, effective, cohesive, moderate opposition?  But thats not the sole measure of whether we are winning or not.  Remember, our first focus, Ed, here is to drive ISIL out of Iraq.  And what were doing in Syria is, first and foremost, in service of reducing ISILs capacity to resupply and send troops, and then run back over the Syrian border -- to eventually reestablish a border between Iraq and Syria so that slowly Iraq regains control of its security and its territory.  That is our number-one mission.  That is our number-one focus.  There are aspects of whats going on in Syria that weve got to deal with in order to reduce the scope of ISILs operations.  So, for example, our support for Kurds in Kobani, where theyve been able to hold off ISIL and where weve been able to effectively strike ISIL positions consistently -- thats not just because were trying to solve a Syria problem.  Thats also because it gives us an opportunity to further weaken ISIL so that we can meet our number-one mission, which is Iraq.  In terms of things to do differently, I guess, Ed, the question youre asking is one actually I think I have answered.  If youre asking about personnel, or if youre asking about position on issues, or what have you, then its probably premature because I want to hear what -- Question:  Your leadership.  Is there something about your leadership -- President Obama:  Ed, what Id like to do is to hear from the Republicans to find out what it is that they would like to see happen.  And what Im committing to is making sure that I am open to working with them on the issues where they think that theres going to be cooperation. Now, that isnt a change, because Ive suggested to them before that where they think theres areas of cooperation, Id like to see us get some things done.  But the fact that they now control both chambers of Congress I think means that perhaps they have more confidence that they can pass their agenda and get a bill on my desk.  It means that negotiations end up perhaps being a little more real because they have larger majorities, for example, in the House and they may be able to get some things through their caucuses that they couldnt before. But the bottom line that the American people want to know and that Im going to repeat here today is that my number-one goal -- because Im not running again, Im not on the ballot, I dont have any further political aspirations -- my number-one goal is just to deliver as much as I can for the American people in these last two years.  And wherever I see an opportunity, no matter how large or how small, to make it a little bit easier for a kid to go to college, make it a little more likely that somebody is finding a good-paying job, make it a little more likely that somebody has high-quality health care -- even if Im not getting a whole loaf, Im interested in getting whatever legislation we can get passed that adds up to improved prospects and an improved future for the American people. Sam Stein. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Following the elections, congressional Republicans are pushing once again for major reforms to your health care act.  In the past, youve said youre open to good ideas but you dont want to undermine the bill.  Can you tell us what specific ideas youre ruling out?  Have the election results changed your calculus on reforming the law?  And how confident are you heading into the second enrollment period? And on a totally unrelated matter -- have you settled on a nominee to replace Attorney General Eric Holder, and if so, who is it? President Obama:  You guys want to spread out your news a little bit, dont you?  You dont want it all in just one big bang.  On the attorney general, we have a number of outstanding candidates who were taking a look at now, and in due course I will have an announcement.  And youll be there, Sam, when thats announced.  But Im confident that well find somebody who is well-qualified, will elicit the confidence of the American people, will uphold their constitutional obligations and rule of law, and will get confirmed by the Senate. On health care, there are certainly some lines Im going to draw.  Repeal of the law I wont sign.  Efforts that would take away health care from the 10 million people who now have it and the millions more who are eligible to get it we're not going to support.  In some cases there may be recommendations that Republicans have for changes that would undermine the structure of the law, and Ill be very honest with them about that and say, look, the law doesn't work if you pull out that piece or that piece. On the other hand, what I have said is theres no law that's ever been passed that is perfect.  And given the contentious nature in which it was passed in the first place, there are places where, if I were just drafting a bill on our own, we would have made those changes back then, and certainly as weve been implementing, there are some other areas where we think we can do even better. So if, in fact, one of the items on Mitch McConnells agenda and John Boehners agenda is to make responsible changes to the Affordable Care Act to make it work better, Im going to be very open and receptive to hearing those ideas.  But what I will remind them is that despite all the contention, we now know that the law works.  You've got millions of people who have health insurance who didn't have it before.  You've got states that have expanded Medicaid to folks who did not have it before, including Republican governors whove concluded this is a good deal for their state. And despite some of the previous predictions, even as weve enrolled more people into the Affordable Care Act and given more people the security of health insurance, health care inflation has gone done every single year since the law passed, so that we now have the lowest increase in health care costs in 50 years, which is saving us about $180 billion in reduced overall costs to the federal government in the Medicare program. So we are I think really proud of the work that's been done. But theres no doubt that there are areas where we can improve it.  So Ill look forward to see what list theyve got of improvements. Question:  Is the individual mandate one of those lines you can't cross? President Obama:  The individual mandate is a line I can't cross because the concept, borrowed from Massachusetts, from a law instituted by a former opponent of mine, Mitt Romney, understood that if you're providing health insurance to people through the private marketplace, then you've got to make sure that people can't game the system and just wait until they get sick before they go try to buy health insurance.  You can't ensure that people with preexisting conditions can get health insurance unless you also say, while you're healthy, before you need it, you've got to get health insurance.  And obviously, there are hardship exemptions.  We understand that there are some folks who, even with the generous subsidies that have been provided, still can't afford it.  But that's a central component of the law. In terms of enrollment, well do some additional announcements about that in the days to come.  Starting in the middle of this month, people can sign up again.  I think there are a number of people who the first time around sat on the sidelines in part because of our screw-ups on healthcare.gov. That's one area, Ed, by the way, that's very particular.  We're really making sure the website works super well before the next open enrollment period.  We're double and triple-checking it.  And so I think a lot of people who maybe initially thought we're not sure how this works, lets wait and see -- they're going to have an opportunity now to sign up.  And whats been terrific is to see how more private insurers have come into the marketplace so that theres greater competition in more markets all around the country.  The premiums that have come in that are available to people and the choices that are available are better than a lot of people I think had predicted.  So the law is working.  That doesnt mean it cant be improved. Major Garrett. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And if you do miss us, allow me to humbly suggest we do this every week. President Obama:  We might.  Who knows.  Im having a great time. Question:  Let me go back to immigration.  Moments before you walked out here, sir, Mitch McConnell said -- and I quote -- that if you in fact use your executive authority to legalize a certain number of millions of undocumented workers, it would poison the well -- direct quote -- and it would be like waving a red flag in front of a bull.  Do you not believe that is the considered opinion of the new Republican majority in the House and Senate?  And do you also not believe what they have said in the aftermath of last nights results that the verdict rendered by voters should stop you or should prevent you from taking this action because it was a subtext in many of the campaigns?  Let me ask you a couple of specifics.  Republicans havent made a mystery about some of the things they intend to say -- President Obama:  Do I have to write all of these down? Question:  Youre very well familiar with these.  These will not be mysteries to you. President Obama:  No, but I -- Question:  Keystone XL pipeline -- they will send you legislation on that.  They will ask you to repeal the medical device tax as a part of a funding mechanism of the Affordable Care Act.  And they have said they would like to repatriate some maybe $2 trillion of offshore revenue at the corporate level by reforming the corporate tax code without touching the individual tax code.  To use your words, Mr. President, are any of those three lines you cannot cross and also deal with what you perceive to be Republican attitudes about immigration? President Obama:  All right.  I think, Major, that I answered the question on immigration.  I have no doubt that there will be some Republicans who are angered or frustrated by any executive action that I may take.  Those are folks, I just have to say, who are also deeply opposed to immigration reform in any form and blocked the House from being able to pass a bipartisan bill.  I have said before that I actually believe that John Boehner is sincere about wanting to get immigration reform passed, which is why for a year I held off taking any action beyond what we had already done for the so-called DREAM kids, and did everything I could to give him space and room to get something done.  And what I also said at the time was, if, in fact, Congress -- if this Congress could not get something done, then I would take further executive actions in order to make the system work better, understanding that any bill that they pass will supplant the executive actions that I take. So I just want to reemphasize this, Major -- if, in fact, there is a great eagerness on the part of Republicans to tackle a broken immigration system, then they have every opportunity to do it.  My executive actions not only do not prevent them from passing a law that supersedes those actions, but should be a spur for them to actually try to get something done.  And I am prepared to engage them every step of the way with their ideas. I think we should have further broad-based debate among the American people.  As Ive said before, I do think that the episode with the unaccompanied children changed a lot of attitudes.  I think what may also change a lot of attitudes is when the public now realizes that that was a very temporary and isolated event, and that, in fact, we have fewer illegal immigrants coming in today than we did five years ago, 10 years ago or 20 years go, but that what we also have is a system that is not serving our economy well. Question:  -- Republicans who say the election was a referendum, at least in part, on your intentions to use executive authority for immigration. President Obama:  As I said before, I dont want to try to read the tea leaves on election results.  What I am going to try to do as President is to make sure that Im advancing what I think is best for the country.  And heres an opportunity where I can use my administrative authorities, executive authorities, and lawfully try to make improvements on the existing system, understanding that thats not going to fix the entire problem, and were much better off if we go ahead and pass a comprehensive bill.  And I hope that the Republicans really want to get it passed.  If they do, theyre going to have a lot of cooperation from me. So let me just tick off -- on Keystone, theres an independent process.  Its moving forward.  And Im going to let that process play out.  Ive given some parameters in terms of how I think about it:  Ultimately, is this going to be good for the American people?  Is it going to be good for their pocketbook?  Is it going to actually create jobs?  Is it actually going to reduce gas prices that have been coming down?  And is it going to be, on net, something that doesnt increase climate change that were going to have to grapple with? Theres a pending case before a Nebraska judge about some of the citing.  The process is moving forward.  And Im just going to gather up the facts. I will note, while this debate about Canadian oil has been raging -- keep in mind this is Canadian oil, this isnt U.S. oil -- while that debate has been raging, weve seen some of the biggest increases in American oil production and American natural gas production in our history.  We are closer to energy independence than weve ever been before -- or at least as weve been in decades.  We are importing less foreign oil than we produce for the first time in a very long time.  Weve got a 100-year supply of natural gas that if we responsibly tap puts us in the strongest position when it comes to energy of any industrialized country around the world. When I travel to Asia or I travel to Europe, their biggest envy is the incredible homegrown U.S. energy production that is producing jobs and attracting manufacturing, because locating here means youve got lower energy costs.  So our energy sector is booming.  And Im happy to engage Republicans with additional ideas for how we can enhance that.  I should note that our clean energy production is booming as well. And so Keystone I just consider as one small aspect of a broader trend thats really positive for the American people. And lets see -- okay, medical device tax.  Ive already answered the question.  We are going to take a look at whatever ideas -- let me take a look comprehensively at the ideas that they present.  Lets give them time to tell me.  Id rather hear it from them than from you. Question:  For example -- President Obama:  Major -- Question:  Im just telling you what they said. President Obama:  Conceivably, I could just cancel my meeting on Friday because Ive heard everything from you.  I think Id rather let Mitch McConnell -- Question:  I just asked if it was a line you couldnt cross. President Obama:  Id rather hear from Mitch McConnell and John Boehner what ideas theyd like to pursue, and well have a conversation with them on that. On repatriation, I said in my opening remarks that there is an opportunity for us to do a tax reform package that is good for business, good for jobs, and can potentially finance infrastructure development here in the United States.  Now, the devil is in the details.  So I think, conceptually, its something where we may have some overlap, and Im very interested in pursuing ideas that can put folks to work right now on roads and bridges and waterways and ports, and a better air traffic control system.  If we had one, by the way, we would reduce delays by about 30 percent.  We could reduce fuel costs for airlines by about 30 percent.  And hopefully that would translate into cheaper airline tickets, which I know everybody would be interested in. So theres all kind of work we can do on our infrastructure. This may be one mechanism that Republicans are comfortable in financing those kinds of efforts.  So that will be part of the discussion that I think were prepared for on Friday and then in the weeks to come leading into the new Congress. Whew.  Major works me, man.  Jim Acosta. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I know you dont want to read the tea leaves, but it is a fact that your party rejected you in these midterms.  By and large, they did not want you out on the campaign trail in these key battleground states.  How do you account for that?  And your aides have said that this is the fourth quarter of your administration, but I dont know if you saw the morning talk shows, but there were several potential candidates for 2016 who are out there already.  Is the clock ticking?  Are you running out of time?  How much time do you have left?  And what do you make of the notion that youre now a lame duck? President Obama:  Well, traditionally, after the last midterm of the two-term presidency, since I cant run again, thats the label that you guys apply.  Heres what I tell my team -- I told them this last week and I told them this this morning -- we had this incredible privilege of being in charge of the most important organization on Earth, the U.S. government and our military, and everything that we do for good around the world. And theres a lot of work to be done to make government work better, to make Americans safer, to make opportunity available to more people, for us to be able to have a positive influence in every corner of the globe -- the way we're doing right now in West Africa.  And Im going to squeeze every last little bit of opportunity to help make this world a better place over these last two years. And some of that is going to be what we can do administratively, and simple things like how do we make customer service better in every agency.  Are there things we can do to streamline how our veterans access care?  Are there better ways that we can make businesses understand the programs that are available to them to promote their business or exports?  So theres a whole bunch of stuff to do on that front.  And as I said before, theres going to be opportunities to work with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill to get laws done.  And if you look at the history of almost every President, those last two years, all kinds of stuff happens; in some cases, stuff that we couldnt predict.  So the one thing Im pretty confident about, Jim, is Im going to be busy for the next two years.  And the one thing that I want the American people to be confident about is that every day Im going to be filling up my time trying to figure out how I can make their lives better.  And if Im doing that, at the end of my presidency, Ill say, we played that fourth quarter well.  And we played the game well.  And the only difference between I guess basketball and politics is that the only score that matters is how did somebody else do, not how you did.  And that's the score Im keeping.  Am I going to be able to look back and say, are more people working? Are there bank accounts better?  Are more kids going to college? Has housing improved?  Is the financial system more stable?  Are younger kids getting a better education?  Do we have greater energy independence?  Is the environment cleaner?  Have we done something about climate change?  Have we dealt with an ongoing terrorist threat and helped to bring about stability around the world?  And those things -- every single day Ive got an opportunity to make a difference on those fronts, which is -- Question:  And you're not satisfied with where you are now? President Obama:  Absolutely not.  I wouldnt be satisfied as long as Im meeting somebody who has a -- doesnt have a job and wants one.  Im not going to be satisfied as long as theres a kid who writes me a letter and says, I got $60,000 worth of debt and I dont know how to pay it back.  And the American people arent satisfied.  So I want to do everything I can to deliver for them. Question:  And how about Democrats, the fact that they kept you out of these battleground states?  Does that kind of bug you a little bit? President Obama:  Listen, as I think some of you saw when I was out on the campaign trail, I love campaigning.  I love talking to ordinary people.  I love listening to their stories.  I love shaking hands and getting hugs and just seeing the process of democracy and citizenship manifest itself during an election. But Im also a practical guy.  And ultimately, every candidate out there had to make their own decisions about what they thought would be most helpful for them.  And I wanted to make sure that Im respectful of their particular region, their particular state or congressional district, and if it was more helpful for them for me to be behind the scenes, Im happy to do it. Question:  You don't think it was a mistake? President Obama:  I dont have -- Ill let other people analyze that.  But what I will emphasize is that one of the nice things about being in the sixth year of your presidency is youve seen a lot of ups and downs and youve gotten more than your fair share of attention.  And Ive had the limelight, and there have been times where the request for my appearances were endless.  There have been times where, politically, we were down -- and it all kind of evens out, which is why whats most important I think is keeping your eye on the ball, and that is are you actually getting some good done. Scott Horsley, last question. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You mentioned that where your policies actually were on the ballot they often did better than members of your party.  Does that signal some shortcoming on your part or on the partys part in framing this election and communicating to the American people what it is that Democrats stand for? President Obama:  I do think that one area where I know were constantly experimenting and trying to do better is just making sure that people know exactly what it is that were trying to accomplish and what we have accomplished in clear ways that people can -- that understand how it affects them.  And I think the minimum wage I talked about a lot on the campaign trail, but Im not sure it penetrated well enough to make a difference.  Part of what I also think weve got to look at is that two-thirds of people who were eligible to vote just didnt vote.  One of the things that Im very proud of in 2008 and 2012 when I ran for office was we got people involved who hadnt been involved before.  We got folks to vote who hadnt voted before, particularly young people.  And that was part of the promise and the excitement was if you get involved, if you participate, if you embrace that sense of citizenship, then things change -- and not just in abstract ways, they change in concrete ways.  Somebody gets a job who didnt have it before.  Somebody gets health care who didnt have it before.  Or a student is able to go to college who couldnt afford it before.  And sustaining that, especially in midterm elections, has proven difficult; sustaining that sense of, if you get involved and if you vote then there is going to be big change out there.  And partly I think when they look at Washington, they say, nothing is working and its not making a difference, and theres just a constant slew of bad news coming over the TV screen, then you can understand how folks would get discouraged. But its my job to figure this out as best I can.  And if the way we are talking about issues isnt working, then Im going to try some different things.  If the ways that were approaching the Republicans in Congress isnt working, Im going to try different things -- whether its having a drink with Mitch McConnell or letting John Boehner beat me again at golf, or weekly press conferences -- I dont know if that would be effective.  Whatever I think might make a difference in this, Im going to be trying out up until my last day in office. But Ill close with what I said in my opening statement.  I am really optimistic about America.  I know that runs counter to the current mood, but when you look at the facts, our economy is stronger than just about anybodys.  Our energy production is better than just about anybodys.  Weve slashed our deficit by more than half.  More people have health insurance.  Our businesses have the strongest balance sheets that theyve had in decades.  Our young people are just incredibly talented and gifted, and more of them are graduating from high school, and more of them are going on to college, and more women are getting degrees and entering into the workforce. And part of the reason I love campaigning is you travel around the country, folks are just good.  They're smart and they're hardworking.  And they're not always paying a lot of attention to Washington, and in some cases theyve given up on Washington.  But their impulses are not sharply partisan, and their impulses are not ideological.  They're really practical, good, generous people.  And we continue to be a magnet for the best and brightest from all around the world.  We have all the best cards relative to every other country on Earth.  Our armed forces, you talk to them -- I had a chance this morning to just call some of our health service that is operating in Liberia, and the amount of hope and professionalism that theyve brought has galvanized the entire country, and has built -- theyve built a platform effectively for other countries suddenly to start coming in.  And we're seeing real progress in fighting the disease in a country that just a month or a month and a half ago was desperate and had no hope. So all that makes me optimistic.  And my job over the next couple of years is to do some practical, concrete things -- as much as possible with Congress; where its not possible with Congress, on my own -- to show people why we should be confident, and to give people a sense of progress and a sense of hope. That doesn't mean there arent going to be ongoing nagging problems that are stubborn and can't be solved overnight.  And probably the biggest one is the fact that despite economic growth, wages and income have still not gone up.  And that's a long-term trend that weve seen for 10, 20, 30 years.  And it makes people worried about not just their own situation, but whether their kids are going to be doing better than they did, which is the essence of the American Dream.  I think there are some concrete things we can do to make sure that wages and incomes do go up.  Minimum wage in those five states was a good start.  But I think more than anything what I want to communicate over these next two years is the promise and possibility of America.  This is just an extraordinary country.  And our democracy is messy.  And we're diverse and we're big.  And there are times where you're a politician and you're disappointed with election results.  But maybe Im just getting older -- I don't know.  It doesn't make me mopey.  It energizes me because it means that this democracy is working.  And people in America were restless and impatient, and we want to get things done.  And even when things are going good, we want them to do better.  And that's why this is the greatest country on Earth.  That's why Im so privileged to have a chance to be President for the next couple years. All right?", "filename": "05November2014MidtermElectionsPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Well, I want to start by thanking a few folks whove joined us today. Weve got the mayor of Osawatomie, Phil Dudley is here. We have your superintendent Gary French in the house. And we have the principal of Osawatomie High, Doug Chisam. And I have brought your former governor, who is doing now an outstanding job as Secretary of Health and Human Services -- Kathleen Sebelius is in the house. We love Kathleen. Well, it is great to be back in the state of Tex -- state of Kansas. I was giving Bill Self a hard time, he was here a while back. As many of you know, I have roots here. Im sure youre all familiar with the Obamas of Osawatomie. Actually, I like to say that I got my name from my father, but I got my accent -- and my values -- from my mother. She was born in Wichita. Her mother grew up in Augusta. Her father was from El Dorado. So my Kansas roots run deep. My grandparents served during World War II. He was a soldier in Pattons Army; she was a worker on a bomber assembly line. And together, they shared the optimism of a nation that triumphed over the Great Depression and over fascism. They believed in an America where hard work paid off, and responsibility was rewarded, and anyone could make it if they tried -- no matter who you were, no matter where you came from, no matter how you started out. And these values gave rise to the largest middle class and the strongest economy that the world has ever known. It was here in America that the most productive workers, the most innovative companies turned out the best products on Earth. And you know what?", "filename": "06December2011SpeechontheEconomyatOsawatomieHighSchool.txt"}, {"question": "After all thats happened, after the worst economic crisis, the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, they want to return to the same practices that got us into this mess. In fact, they want to go back to the same policies that stacked the deck against middle-class Americans for way too many years. And their philosophy is simple: We are better off when everybody is left to fend for themselves and play by their own rules. I am here to say they are wrong. Im here in Kansas to reaffirm my deep conviction that were greater together than we are on our own. I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules. These arent Democratic values or Republican values. These arent 1 percent values or 99 percent values. Theyre American values. And we have to reclaim them. You see, this isnt the first time America has faced this choice. At the turn of the last century, when a nation of farmers was transitioning to become the worlds industrial giant, we had to decide: Would we settle for a country where most of the new railroads and factories were being controlled by a few giant monopolies that kept prices high and wages low? Would we allow our citizens and even our children to work ungodly hours in conditions that were unsafe and unsanitary? Would we restrict education to the privileged few? Because there were people who thought massive inequality and exploitation of people was just the price you pay for progress. Theodore Roosevelt disagreed. He was the Republican son of a wealthy family. He praised what the titans of industry had done to create jobs and grow the economy. He believed then what we know is true today, that the free market is the greatest force for economic progress in human history. Its led to a prosperity and a standard of living unmatched by the rest of the world. But Roosevelt also knew that the free market has never been a free license to take whatever you can from whomever you can. He understood the free market only works when there are rules of the road that ensure competition is fair and open and honest. And so he busted up monopolies, forcing those companies to compete for consumers with better services and better prices. And today, they still must. He fought to make sure businesses couldnt profit by exploiting children or selling food or medicine that wasnt safe. And today, they still cant. And in 1910, Teddy Roosevelt came here to Osawatomie and he laid out his vision for what he called a New Nationalism. Our country, he said, means nothing unless it means the triumph of a real democracyof an economic system under which each man shall be guaranteed the opportunity to show the best that there is in him. Now, for this, Roosevelt was called a radical. He was called a socialist -- even a communist. But today, we are a richer nation and a stronger democracy because of what he fought for in his last campaign: an eight-hour work day and a minimum wage for women -- insurance for the unemployed and for the elderly, and those with disabilities; political reform and a progressive income tax. Today, over 100 years later, our economy has gone through another transformation. Over the last few decades, huge advances in technology have allowed businesses to do more with less, and its made it easier for them to set up shop and hire workers anywhere they want in the world. And many of you know firsthand the painful disruptions this has caused for a lot of Americans. Factories where people thought they would retire suddenly picked up and went overseas, where workers were cheaper. Steel mills that needed 100 -- or 1,000 employees are now able to do the same work with 100 employees, so layoffs too often became permanent, not just a temporary part of the business cycle. And these changes didnt just affect blue-collar workers. If you were a bank teller or a phone operator or a travel agent, you saw many in your profession replaced by ATMs and the Internet. Today, even higher-skilled jobs, like accountants and middle management can be outsourced to countries like China or India. And if youre somebody whose job can be done cheaper by a computer or someone in another country, you dont have a lot of leverage with your employer when it comes to asking for better wages or better benefits, especially since fewer Americans today are part of a union. Now, just as there was in Teddy Roosevelts time, there is a certain crowd in Washington who, for the last few decades, have said, lets respond to this economic challenge with the same old tune. The market will take care of everything, they tell us. If we just cut more regulations and cut more taxes -- especially for the wealthy -- our economy will grow stronger. Sure, they say, there will be winners and losers. But if the winners do really well, then jobs and prosperity will eventually trickle down to everybody else. And, they argue, even if prosperity doesnt trickle down, well, thats the price of liberty. Now, its a simple theory. And we have to admit, its one that speaks to our rugged individualism and our healthy skepticism of too much government. Thats in Americas DNA. And that theory fits well on a bumper sticker. But heres the problem: It doesnt work. It has never worked. It didnt work when it was tried in the decade before the Great Depression. Its not what led to the incredible postwar booms of the 50s and 60s. And it didnt work when we tried it during the last decade. I mean, understand, its not as if we havent tried this theory. Remember in those years, in 2001 and 2003, Congress passed two of the most expensive tax cuts for the wealthy in history. And what did it get us? The slowest job growth in half a century. Massive deficits that have made it much harder to pay for the investments that built this country and provided the basic security that helped millions of Americans reach and stay in the middle class -- things like education and infrastructure, science and technology, Medicare and Social Security. Remember that in those same years, thanks to some of the same folks who are now running Congress, we had weak regulation, we had little oversight, and what did it get us? Insurance companies that jacked up peoples premiums with impunity and denied care to patients who were sick, mortgage lenders that tricked families into buying homes they couldnt afford, a financial sector where irresponsibility and lack of basic oversight nearly destroyed our entire economy. We simply cannot return to this brand of youre on your own economics if were serious about rebuilding the middle class in this country. We know that it doesnt result in a strong economy. It results in an economy that invests too little in its people and in its future. We know it doesnt result in a prosperity that trickles down. It results in a prosperity thats enjoyed by fewer and fewer of our citizens. Look at the statistics. In the last few decades, the average income of the top 1 percent has gone up by more than 250 percent to 1.2 million dollars per year. Im not talking about millionaires, people who have a million dollars. Im saying people who make a million dollars every single year. For the top one hundredth of 1 percent, the average income is now 27 million dollars per year. The typical CEO who used to earn about 30 times more than his or her worker now earns 110 times more. And yet, over the last decade the incomes of most Americans have actually fallen by about 6 percent. Now, this kind of inequality -- a level that we havent seen since the Great Depression -- hurts us all. When middle-class families can no longer afford to buy the goods and services that businesses are selling, when people are slipping out of the middle class, it drags down the entire economy from top to bottom. America was built on the idea of broad-based prosperity, of strong consumers all across the country. Thats why a CEO like Henry Ford made it his mission to pay his workers enough so that they could buy the cars he made. Its also why a recent study showed that countries with less inequality tend to have stronger and steadier economic growth over the long run. Inequality also distorts our democracy. It gives an outsized voice to the few who can afford high-priced lobbyists and unlimited campaign contributions, and it runs the risk of selling out our democracy to the highest bidder. It leaves everyone else rightly suspicious that the system in Washington is rigged against them, that our elected representatives arent looking out for the interests of most Americans. But theres an even more fundamental issue at stake. This kind of gaping inequality gives lie to the promise thats at the very heart of America: that this is a place where you can make it if you try. We tell people -- we tell our kids -- that in this country, even if youre born with nothing, work hard and you can get into the middle class. We tell them that your children will have a chance to do even better than you do. Thats why immigrants from around the world historically have flocked to our shores. And yet, over the last few decades, the rungs on the ladder of opportunity have grown farther and farther apart, and the middle class has shrunk. You know, a few years after World War II, a child who was born into poverty had a slightly better than 50-50 chance of becoming middle class as an adult. By 1980, that chance had fallen to around 40 percent. And if the trend of rising inequality over the last few decades continues, its estimated that a child born today will only have a one-in-three chance of making it to the middle class -- 33 percent. Its heartbreaking enough that there are millions of working families in this country who are now forced to take their children to food banks for a decent meal. But the idea that those children might not have a chance to climb out of that situation and back into the middle class, no matter how hard they work?", "filename": "06December2011SpeechontheEconomyatOsawatomieHighSchool.txt"}, {"question": "Its not a view that says we should punish profit or success or pretend that government knows how to fix all of societys problems. It is a view that says in America we are greater together -- when everyone engages in fair play and everybody gets a fair shot and everybody does their fair share. So what does that mean for restoring middle-class security in todays economy? Well, it starts by making sure that everyone in America gets a fair shot at success. The truth is well never be able to compete with other countries when it comes to whos best at letting their businesses pay the lowest wages, whos best at busting unions, whos best at letting companies pollute as much as they want. Thats a race to the bottom that we cant win, and we shouldnt want to win that race. Those countries dont have a strong middle class. They dont have our standard of living. The race we want to win, the race we can win is a race to the top -- the race for good jobs that pay well and offer middle-class security. Businesses will create those jobs in countries with the highest-skilled, highest-educated workers, the most advanced transportation and communication, the strongest commitment to research and technology. The world is shifting to an innovation economy and nobody does innovation better than America. Nobody does it better. No one has better colleges. Nobody has better universities. Nobody has a greater diversity of talent and ingenuity. No ones workers or entrepreneurs are more driven or more daring. The things that have always been our strengths match up perfectly with the demands of the moment. But we need to meet the moment. Weve got to up our game. We need to remember that we can only do that together. It starts by making education a national mission -- a national mission. Government and businesses, parents and citizens. In this economy, a higher education is the surest route to the middle class. The unemployment rate for Americans with a college degree or more is about half the national average. And their incomes are twice as high as those who dont have a high school diploma. Which means we shouldnt be laying off good teachers right now -- we should be hiring them. We shouldnt be expecting less of our schools - we should be demanding more. We shouldnt be making it harder to afford college -- we should be a country where everyone has a chance to go and doesnt rack up $100,000 of debt just because they went. In todays innovation economy, we also need a world-class commitment to science and research, the next generation of high-tech manufacturing. Our factories and our workers shouldnt be idle. We should be giving people the chance to get new skills and training at community colleges so they can learn how to make wind turbines and semiconductors and high-powered batteries. And by the way, if we dont have an economy thats built on bubbles and financial speculation, our best and brightest wont all gravitate towards careers in banking and finance. Because if we want an economy thats built to last, we need more of those young people in science and engineering. This country should not be known for bad debt and phony profits. We should be known for creating and selling products all around the world that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America. Today, manufacturers and other companies are setting up shop in the places with the best infrastructure to ship their products, move their workers, communicate with the rest of the world. And thats why the over 1 million construction workers who lost their jobs when the housing market collapsed, they shouldnt be sitting at home with nothing to do. They should be rebuilding our roads and our bridges, laying down faster railroads and broadband, modernizing our schools -- all the things other countries are already doing to attract good jobs and businesses to their shores. Yes, business, and not government, will always be the primary generator of good jobs with incomes that lift people into the middle class and keep them there. But as a nation, weve always come together, through our government, to help create the conditions where both workers and businesses can succeed. And historically, that hasnt been a partisan idea. Franklin Roosevelt worked with Democrats and Republicans to give veterans of World War II -- including my grandfather, Stanley Dunham -- the chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill. It was a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, a proud son of Kansas -- who started the Interstate Highway System, and doubled down on science and research to stay ahead of the Soviets. Of course, those productive investments cost money. Theyre not free. And so weve also paid for these investments by asking everybody to do their fair share. Look, if we had unlimited resources, no one would ever have to pay any taxes and we would never have to cut any spending. But we dont have unlimited resources. And so we have to set priorities. If we want a strong middle class, then our tax code must reflect our values. We have to make choices. Today that choice is very clear. To reduce our deficit, Ive already signed nearly $1 trillion of spending cuts into law and Ive proposed trillions more, including reforms that would lower the cost of Medicare and Medicaid. But in order to structurally close the deficit, get our fiscal house in order, we have to decide what our priorities are. Now, most immediately, short term, we need to extend a payroll tax cut thats set to expire at the end of this month. If we dont do that, 160 million Americans, including most of the people here, will see their taxes go up by an average of $1,000 starting in January and it would badly weaken our recovery. Thats the short term. In the long term, we have to rethink our tax system more fundamentally. We have to ask ourselves: Do we want to make the investments we need in things like education and research and high-tech manufacturing -- all those things that helped make us an economic superpower? Or do we want to keep in place the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans in our country? Because we cant afford to do both. That is not politics. Thats just math. Now, so far, most of my Republican friends in Washington have refused under any circumstance to ask the wealthiest Americans to go to the same tax rate they were paying when Bill Clinton was president. So lets just do a trip down memory lane here. Keep in mind, when President Clinton first proposed these tax increases, folks in Congress predicted they would kill jobs and lead to another recession. Instead, our economy created nearly 23 million jobs and we eliminated the deficit. Today, the wealthiest Americans are paying the lowest taxes in over half a century. This isnt like in the early 50s, when the top tax rate was over 90 percent. This isnt even like the early 80s, when the top tax rate was about 70 percent. Under President Clinton, the top rate was only about 39 percent. Today, thanks to loopholes and shelters, a quarter of all millionaires now pay lower tax rates than millions of you, millions of middle-class families. Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent. One percent. That is the height of unfairness. It is wrong. Its wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker, maybe earns $50,000 a year, should pay a higher tax rate than somebody raking in $50 million. Its wrong for Warren Buffetts secretary to pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett. And by the way, Warren Buffett agrees with me. So do most Americans -- Democrats, independents and Republicans. And I know that many of our wealthiest citizens would agree to contribute a little more if it meant reducing the deficit and strengthening the economy that made their success possible. This isnt about class warfare. This is about the nations welfare. Its about making choices that benefit not just the people whove done fantastically well over the last few decades, but that benefits the middle class, and those fighting to get into the middle class, and the economy as a whole. Finally, a strong middle class can only exist in an economy where everyone plays by the same rules, from Wall Street to Main Street. As infuriating as it was for all of us, we rescued our major banks from collapse, not only because a full-blown financial meltdown would have sent us into a second Depression, but because we need a strong, healthy financial sector in this country. But part of the deal was that we wouldnt go back to business as usual. And thats why last year we put in place new rules of the road that refocus the financial sector on what should be their core purpose: getting capital to the entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and financing millions of families who want to buy a home or send their kids to college. Now, were not all the way there yet, and the banks are fighting us every inch of the way. But already, some of these reforms are being implemented. If youre a big bank or risky financial institution, you now have to write out a living will that details exactly how youll pay the bills if you fail, so that taxpayers are never again on the hook for Wall Streets mistakes. There are also limits on the size of banks and new abilities for regulators to dismantle a firm that is going under. The new law bans banks from making risky bets with their customers deposits, and it takes away big bonuses and paydays from failed CEOs, while giving shareholders a say on executive salaries. This is the law that we passed. We are in the process of implementing it now. All of this is being put in place as we speak. Now, unless youre a financial institution whose business model is built on breaking the law, cheating consumers and making risky bets that could damage the entire economy, you should have nothing to fear from these new rules. Some of you may know, my grandmother worked as a banker for most of her life -- worked her way up, started as a secretary, ended up being a vice president of a bank. And I know from her, and I know from all the people that Ive come in contact with, that the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals, they want to do right by their customers. They want to have rules in place that dont put them at a disadvantage for doing the right thing. And yet, Republicans in Congress are fighting as hard as they can to make sure that these rules arent enforced. Ill give you a specific example. For the first time in history, the reforms that we passed put in place a consumer watchdog who is charged with protecting everyday Americans from being taken advantage of by mortgage lenders or payday lenders or debt collectors. And the man we nominated for the post, Richard Cordray, is a former attorney general of Ohio who has the support of most attorney generals, both Democrat and Republican, throughout the country. Nobody claims hes not qualified. But the Republicans in the Senate refuse to confirm him for the job; they refuse to let him do his job. Why? Does anybody here think that the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors?", "filename": "06December2011SpeechontheEconomyatOsawatomieHighSchool.txt"}, {"question": "They were white and black; Latino and Asian; immigrants and American-born; moms and dads; daughters and sons.  Each of them served their fellow citizens and all of them were part of our American family. Tonight, I want to talk with you about this tragedy, the broader threat ofterrorism, and how we can keep our country safe. The FBI is still gathering the facts about what happened in San Bernardino, but here is what we know.  The victims were brutally murdered and injured by one of their coworkers and his wife.  So far, we have no evidence that the killers were directed by a terrorist organization overseas, or that they were part of a broader conspiracy here at home.  But it is clear that the two of them had gone down the dark path of radicalization, embracing a perverted interpretation of Islam that calls for war against America and the West.  They had stockpiled assault weapons, ammunition, and pipe bombs.  So this was an act of terrorism, designed to kill innocent people. Our nation has been at war with terrorists since al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 Americans on 9/11.  In the process, weve hardened our defenses -- from airports to financial centers, to other critical infrastructure.  Intelligence and law enforcement agencies have disrupted countless plots here and overseas, and worked around the clock to keep us safe.  Our military and counterterrorism professionals have relentlessly pursued terrorist networks overseas -- disrupting safe havens in several different countries, killing Osama bin Laden, and decimating al Qaedas leadership. Over the last few years, however, the terrorist threat has evolved into a new phase.  As weve become better at preventing complex, multifaceted attacks like 9/11, terrorists turned to less complicated acts of violence like the mass shootings that are all too common in our society.  It is this type of attack that we saw at Fort Hood in 2009; in Chattanooga earlier this year; and now in San Bernardino.  And as groups like ISIL grew stronger amidst the chaos of war in Iraq and then Syria, and as the Internet erases the distance between countries, we see growing efforts by terrorists to poison the minds of people like the Boston Marathon bombers and the San Bernardino killers. For seven years, Ive confronted this evolving threat each morning in my intelligence briefing.  And since the day I took this office, Ive authorized U.S. forces to take out terrorists abroad precisely because I know how real the danger is.  As Commander-in-Chief, I have no greater responsibility than the security of the American people.  As a father to two young daughters who are the most precious part of my life, I know that we see ourselves with friends and coworkers at a holiday party like the one in San Bernardino.  I know we see our kids in the faces of the young people killed in Paris.  And I know that after so much war, many Americans are asking whether we are confronted by a cancer that has no immediate cure. Well, heres what I want you to know:  The threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it.  We will destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us.  Our success wont depend on tough talk, or abandoning our values, or giving into fear.  Thats what groups like ISIL are hoping for.  Instead, we will prevail by being strong and smart, resilient and relentless, and by drawing upon every aspect of American power. Heres how.  First, our military will continue to hunt down terrorist plotters in any country where it is necessary.  In Iraq and Syria, airstrikes are taking out ISIL leaders, heavy weapons, oil tankers, infrastructure.  And since the attacks in Paris, our closest allies -- including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom -- have ramped up their contributions to our military campaign, which will help us accelerate our effort to destroy ISIL. Second, we will continue to provide training and equipment to tens of thousands of Iraqi and Syrian forces fighting ISIL on the ground so that we take away their safe havens.  In both countries, were deploying Special Operations Forces who can accelerate that offensive.  Weve stepped up this effort since the attacks in Paris, and well continue to invest more in approaches that are working on the ground. Third, were working with friends and allies to stop ISILs operations -- to disrupt plots, cut off their financing, and prevent them from recruiting more fighters.  Since the attacks in Paris, weve surged intelligence-sharing with our European allies.  Were working with Turkey to seal its border with Syria. And we are cooperating with Muslim-majority countries -- and with our Muslim communities here at home -- to counter the vicious ideology that ISIL promotes online. Fourth, with American leadership, the international community has begun to establish a process -- and timeline -- to pursue ceasefires and a political resolution to the Syrian war. Doing so will allow the Syrian people and every country, including our allies, but also countries like Russia, to focus on the common goal of destroying ISIL -- a group that threatens us all. This is our strategy to destroy ISIL.  It is designed and supported by our military commanders and counterterrorism experts, together with 65 countries that have joined an American-led coalition.  And we constantly examine our strategy to determine when additional steps are needed to get the job done. Thats why Ive ordered the Departments of State and Homeland Security to review the Visa Waiver Program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country.  And thats why I will urge high-tech and law enforcement leaders to make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from justice. Now, here at home, we have to work together to address the challenge.  There are several steps that Congress should take right away. To begin with, Congress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun.  What could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semi-automatic weapon?", "filename": "06December2015OnForeignandDomesticStrategiesAgainstTerrorism.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you. Thank you so much, everybody. Please have a seat, have a seat.  Before I get started, can we get the new presidential setup out here?  It's worked before. That's more like it. It is great to be back.  What a year, huh?  I usually start these dinners with a few self-deprecating jokes.  After my stellar 2013, what could I possibly talk about? I admit it -- last year was rough.  Sheesh.  At one point things got so bad, the 47 percent called Mitt Romney to apologize. Of course, we rolled out healthcare.gov.  That could have gone better.  In 2008 my slogan was, \"Yes We Can.\"  In 2013 my slogan was, \"Control-Alt-Delete.\"  On the plus side, they did turn the launch of healthcare.gov into one of the year's biggest movies. But rather than dwell on the past, I would like to pivot to this dinner.  Let's welcome our headliner this evening, Joel McHale. On \"Community,\" Joel plays a preening, self-obsessed narcissist.  So this dinner must be a real change of pace for you. I want to thank the White House Correspondents Association for hosting us here tonight.  I am happy to be here, even though I am a little jet-lagged from my trip to Malaysia.  The lengths we have to go to get CNN coverage these days. I think they're still searching for their table. MSNBC is here.  They're a little overwhelmed.  They've never seen an audience this big before. But, look, everybody is trying to keep up with this incredibly fast-changing media landscape.  For example, I got a lot of grief on cable news for promoting Obamacare to young people on Between Two Ferns.  But that's what young people like to watch.  And to be fair, I am not the first person on television between two potted plants. Sometimes I do feel disrespected by you reporters.  But that's okay.  Seattle Seahawk cornerback Richard Sherman is here tonight.  And he gave me some great tips on how to handle it.  Jake Tapper, don't you ever talk about me like that!1 I'm the best President in the game! What do you think, Richard?  Was that good?  A little more feeling next time? While we're talking sports, just last month, a wonderful story -- an American won the Boston Marathon for first time in 30 years.  Which was inspiring and only fair, since a Kenyan has been president for the last six. Had to even things out. We have some other athletes here tonight, including Olympic snowboarding gold medalist Jamie Anderson is here.  We're proud of her.  Incredibly talented young lady.  Michelle and I watched the Olympics -- we cannot believe what these folks do -- death-defying feats -- haven't seen somebody pull a \"180\" that fast since Rand Paul disinvited that Nevada rancher from this dinner.  As a general rule, things don't like end well if the sentence starts, Let me tell you something \"I know about the negro.\"2  You don't really need to hear the rest of it.  Just a tip for you -- don't start your sentence that way. Speaking of Rand Paul -- Colorado legalized marijuana this year, an interesting social experiment.  I do hope it doesn't lead to a whole lot of paranoid people who think that the federal government is out to get them and listening to their phone calls.  That would be a problem. And speaking of conservative heroes, the Koch brothers bought a table here tonight.  But as usual, they used a shadowy right-wing organization as a front.  Hello, Fox News. I'm just kidding.  Let's face it, Fox, you'll miss me when I'm gone. It will be harder to convince the American people that Hillary was born in Kenya. A lot of us really are concerned about the way big money is influencing our politics.  I remember when a Super PAC was just me buying Marlboro 100s instead of regulars. Of course, now that it's 2014, Washington is obsessed on the midterms.  Folks are saying that with my sagging poll numbers, my fellow Democrats don't really want me campaigning with them.  And I don't think that's true -- although I did notice the other day that Sasha needed a speaker at career day, and she invited Bill Clinton. I was a little hurt by that. Both sides are doing whatever it takes to win the ruthless game.  Republicans -- this is a true story -- Republicans actually brought in a group of consultants to teach their candidates how to speak to women.  This is true.  And I don't know if it will work with women, but I understand that America's teenage boys are signing up to run for the Senate in droves. Anyway, while you guys focus on the horserace, I'm going to do what I do -- I'm going to be focused on everyday Americans.  Just yesterday, I read a heartbreaking letter -- you know I get letters from folks from around the country; every day I get 10 that I read -- this one got to me.  A Virginia man who's been stuck in the same part-time job for years; no respect from his boss; no chance to get ahead.  I really wish Eric Cantor would stop writing me. You can just pick up the phone, Eric. And I'm feeling sorry -- believe it or not -- for the Speaker of the House, as well.  These days, the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give me, which means orange really is the new black. But I have not given up the idea of working with Congress. In fact, two weeks ago, Senator Ted Cruz and I, we got a bill done together.  And I have to say, the signing ceremony was something special.  We've got a picture of it I think. Look, I know, Washington seems more dysfunctional than ever.  Gridlock has gotten so bad in this town you have to wonder:  What did we do to piss off Chris Christie so bad? One issue, for example, we haven't been able to agree on is unemployment insurance.  Republicans continue to refuse to extend it.  And you know what, I am beginning to think they've got a point.  If you want to get paid while not working, you should have to run for Congress just like everybody else. Of course, there is one thing that keeps Republicans busy.  They have tried more than 50 times to repeal Obamacare.  Despite that, 8 million people signed up for health care in the first open enrollment. Which does lead one to ask, How well does Obamacare have to work before you don't want to repeal it?  What if everybody's cholesterol drops to 120?  What if your yearly checkup came with tickets to a Clippers game?  Not the old, Donald Sterling Clippers -- the new Oprah Clippers.  Would that be good enough? What if they gave Mitch McConnell a pulse?  What is it going to take? Anyway, this year, I've promised to use more executive actions to get things done without Congress.  My critics call this the \"imperial presidency.\"  The truth is, I just show up every day in my office and do my job.  I've got a picture of this, I think.  You would think they'd appreciate a more assertive approach, considering that the new conservative darling is none other than Vladimir Putin.  Last year, Pat Buchanan said Putin is \"headed straight for the Nobel Peace Prize.\"3  He said this.  Now I know it sounds crazy but to be fair, they give those to just about anybody these days.  So it could happen. But it's not just Pat -- Rudy Giuliani said Putin is \"what you call a leader.\"  Mike Huckabee and Sean Hannity keep talking about his bare chest, which is kind of weird.  Look it up -- they talk about it a lot. It is strange to think that I have just two and a half years left in this office.  Everywhere I look, there are reminders that I only hold this job temporarily. But it's a long time between now and 2016, and anything can happen.  You may have heard the other day, Hillary had to dodge a flying shoe at a press conference.  I love that picture. Regardless of what happens, I've run my last campaign and I'm beginning to think about my legacy.  Some of you know -- Mayor Rahm Emanuel recently announced he is naming a high school in Chicago after me, which is extremely humbling.  I was even more flattered to hear Rick Perry, who is here tonight, is doing the same thing in Texas.  Take a look. Thank you, Rick.  It means a lot to me. And I intend to enjoy all the free time that I will have.  George W. Bush took up painting after he left office, which inspired me to take up my own artistic side.  I'm sure we've got a shot of this. Maybe not.  The joke doesn't work without the slide.  Oh well.  Assume that it was funny. Does this happen to you, Joel?  It does?  Okay. On a more serious note, tonight reminds us that we really are lucky to live in a country where reporters get to give a head of state a hard time on a daily basis -- and then, once a year, give him or her the chance, at least, to try to return the favor. But we also know that not every journalist, or photographer, or crewmember is so fortunate, because even as we celebrate the free press tonight, our thoughts are with those in places around the globe like Ukraine, and Afghanistan, and Syria, and Egypt, who risk everything -- in some cases, even give their lives -- to report the news.  And what tonight also reminds us is that the fight for full and fair access goes beyond the chance to ask a question.  As Steve mentioned, decades ago, an African American who wanted to cover his or her President might be barred from journalism school, burdened by Jim Crow, and, once in Washington, banned from press conferences.  But after years of effort, black editors and publishers began meeting with FDR's press secretary, Steve Early.  And then they met with the President himself, who declared that a black reporter would get a credential.  And even when Harry McAlpin made history as the first African American to attend a presidential news conference, he wasn't always welcomed by the other reporters.  But he was welcomed by the President, who told him, I'm glad to see you, McAlpin, and I'm very happy to have you here. Now, that sentiment might have worn off once Harry asked him a question or two -- and Harry's battles continued.  But he made history.  And we're s proud of Sherman and his family for being here tonight, and the White House Correspondents Association for creating a scholarship in Harry's name. For over 100 years, even as the White House Correspondents Association has told the story of America's progress, you've lived it, too -- gradually allowing equal access to women, and minorities, and gays, and Americans with disabilities.  And, yes, radio, and television, and Internet reporters, as well.  And through it all, you've helped make sure that even as societies change, our fundamental commitment to the interaction between those who govern and those who ask questions doesn't change.  And as Jay will attest, it's a legacy you carry on enthusiastically  every single day. And because this is the 100th anniversary of the Correspondents' Association, I actually recorded an additional brief video thanking all of you for your hard work.  Can we run the video? And because this is the 100th anniversary of the Correspondents' Association, I actually recorded an additional brief video thanking all of you for your hard work.  Can we run the video?

President Obama:  Oh, thank you.  You got it?", "filename": "06February2014Speechatthe62ndNationalPrayerBreakfast.txt"}, {"question": "And that includes the work that brings me here today -- our mission to degrade and ultimately destroy the terrorist group ISIL.  This is a cause, a coalition, thats united countries across the globe -- some 60 nations, including Arab partners.  Our comprehensive strategy against ISIL is harnessing all elements of American power, across our government -- military, intelligence, diplomatic, economic, development and perhaps most importantly, the power of our values. Last month, I ordered additional actions in support of our strategy.  I just met with my national security team as part of our regular effort to assess our efforts -- whats working and what we can do better.  Secretary Carter, Chairman Dempsey, I want to thank you and your team for welcoming us and for your leadership, including General Austin whos leading the military campaign.  And I want to summarize briefly where we stand. I want to start by repeating what Ive said since the beginning.  This will not be quick.  This is a long-term campaign.  ISIL is opportunistic and it is nimble.  In many places in Syria and Iraq, including urban areas, its dug in among innocent civilian populations.  It will take time to root them out -- and doing so must be the job of local forces on the ground, with training and air support from our coalition. As with any military effort, there will be periods of progress, but there are also going to be some setbacks -- as weve seen with ISILs gains in Ramadi in Iraq and central and southern Syria.  But today, its also important for us to recognize the progress that's been made. Our coalition has now hit ISIL with more than 5,000 airstrikes.  Weve taken out thousands of fighting positions, tanks, vehicles, bomb factories, and training camps.  Weve eliminated thousands of fighters, including senior ISIL commanders.  And over the past year, weve seen that when we have an effective partner on the ground, ISIL can be pushed back. In Iraq, ISIL lost at the Mosul Dam.  ISIL lost at Mount Sinjar.  ISIL has lost repeatedly across Kirkuk Province.  ISIL lost at Tikrit.  Altogether, ISIL has lost more than a quarter of the populated areas that it had seized in Iraq.  In Syria, ISIL lost at Kobani.  Its recently endured losses across northern Syria, including the key city of Tal Abyad, denying ISIL a vital supply route to Raqqa, its base of operations in Syria. So these are reminders that ISILs strategic weaknesses are real.  ISIL is surrounded by countries and communities committed to its destruction.  It has no air force; our coalition owns the skies.  ISIL is backed by no nation.  It relies on fear, sometimes executing its own disillusioned fighters.  Its unrestrained brutality often alienates those under its rule, creating new enemies.  In short, ISILs recent losses in both Syria and Iraq prove that ISIL can and will be defeated. Indeed, were intensifying our efforts against ISILs base in Syria.  Our airstrikes will continue to target the oil and gas facilities that fund so much of their operations.  Were going after the ISIL leadership and infrastructure in Syria -- the heart of ISIL that pumps funds and propaganda to people around the world.  Partnering with other countries -- sharing more information, strengthening laws and border security -- allows us to work to stem the flow of foreign fighters to Syria as well as Iraq, and to stem, obviously, the flow of those fighters back into our own countries.  This continues to be a challenge, and, working together, all our nations are going to need to do more, but we're starting to see some progress. Well continue cracking down on ISILs illicit finance around the world.  By the way, if Congress really wants to help in this effort, they can confirm Mr. Adam Szubin, our nominee for Treasury Under Secretary to lead this effort.  This is a vital position to our counterterrorism efforts.  Nobody suggests Mr. Szubin is not qualified.  Hes highly qualified.  Unfortunately, his nomination has been languishing up on the Hill, and we need the Senate to confirm him as soon as possible. Meanwhile, we continue to ramp up our training and support of local forces that are fighting ISIL on the ground.  As Ive said before, this aspect of our strategy was moving too slowly.  But the fall of Ramadi has galvanized the Iraqi government.  So, with the additional steps I ordered last month, were speeding up training of ISIL [Iraqi] forces, including volunteers from Sunni tribes in Anbar Province. More Sunni volunteers are coming forward.  Some are already being trained, and they can be a new force against ISIL.  We continue to accelerate the delivery of critical equipment, including anti-tank weapons, to Iraqi security forces, including the Peshmerga and tribal fighters.  And I made it clear to my team that we will do more to train and equip the moderate opposition in Syria. Now, all this said, our strategy recognizes that no amount of military force will end the terror that is ISIL unless its matched by a broader effort -- political and economic -- that addresses the underlying conditions that have allowed ISIL to gain traction.  They have filled a void, and we have to make sure that as we push them out that void is filled.  So, as Iraqi cities and towns are liberated from ISIL, were working with Iraq and the United Nations to help communities rebuild the security, services and governance that they need.  We continue to support the efforts of Prime Minister Abadi to forge an inclusive and effective Iraqi government that unites all the people of Iraq -- Shia, Sunnis, Kurds and all minority communities. In Syria, the only way that the civil war will end -- and in a way so that the Syrian people can unite against ISIL -- is an inclusive political transition to a new government, without Bashar Assad -- a government that serves all Syrians.  I discussed this with our Gulf Cooperation Council partners at Camp David and during my recent call with President Putin.  I made it clear the United States will continue to work for such a transition. And a glimmer of good news is I think an increasing recognition on the part of all the players in the region that given the extraordinary threat that ISIL poses it is important for us to work together, as opposed to at cross-purposes, to make sure that an inclusive Syrian government exists. While the focus of our discussions today was on Iraq and Syria, ISIL and its ideology also obviously pose a grave threat beyond the region.  In recent weeks weve seen deadly attacks in Tunisia, Kuwait and Egypts Sinai Peninsula.  We see a growing ISIL presence in Libya and attempts to establish footholds across North Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Southeast Asia. Weve seen attacks in Ottawa, Sydney, France and Copenhagen. So Ive called on the international community to unite against this scourge of violent extremism.  In this fight, the United States continues to lead.  When necessary to prevent attacks against our nation, well take direct action against terrorists.  Well continue to also partner with nations from Afghanistan to Nigeria to build up their security forces.  Were going to work day and night with allies and partners to disrupt terrorist networks and thwart attacks, and to smother nascent ISIL cells that may be trying to develop in other parts of the world. This also includes remaining vigilant in protecting against attacks here in the homeland.  Now, I think it's important for us to recognize the threat of violent extremism is not restricted to any one community.  Here in the United States, weve seen all kinds of homegrown terrorism.  And tragically, recent history reminds us how even a single individual motivated by a hateful ideology with access to dangerous weapons can inflict horrendous harm on Americans.  So our efforts to counter violent extremism must not target any one community because of their faith or background, including patriotic Muslim Americans who are our partners in keeping our country safe. That said, we also have to acknowledge that ISIL has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world, including here in the United States.  And they are targeting Muslim communities around the world.  Numerous individuals have been arrested across the country for plotting attacks or attempting to join ISIL in Syria and Iraq.  Two men apparently inspired by ISIL opened fire in Garland, Texas.  And because of our success over the years in improving our homeland security, weve made it harder for terrorists to carry out large-scale attacks like 9/11 here at home. But the threat of lone wolves or small cells of terrorists is complex -- it's harder to detect and harder to prevent.  Its one of the most difficult challenges that we face.  And preventing these kinds of attacks on American soil is going to require sustained effort. So I just want to repeat, the good news is that because of extraordinary efforts from law enforcement as well as our military intelligence, we are doing a better job at preventing any large-scale attacks on the homeland.  On the other hand, the small, individual lone wolf attacks or small cells become harder to detect and they become more sophisticated, using new technologies.  And that means that we're going to have to pick up our game to prevent these attacks. It's also true why, ultimately, in order for us to defeat terrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda it's going to also require us to discredit their ideology -- the twisted thinking that draws vulnerable people into their ranks.  As Ive said before -- and I know our military leaders agree -- this broader challenge of countering violent extremism is not simply a military effort.  Ideologies are not defeated with guns; theyre defeated by better ideas -- a more attractive and more compelling vision. So the United States will continue to do our part, by working with partners to counter ISILs hateful propaganda, especially online.  Well constantly reaffirm through words and deeds that we will never be at war with Islam.  Were fighting terrorists who distort Islam and whose victims are mostly Muslims.  But around the world, were also going to insist on partnering with Muslim communities as they seek security, prosperity and the dignity that they deserve.  And we're going to expect those communities to step up in terms of pushing back as hard as they can, in conjunction with other people of goodwill, against these hateful ideologies in order to discredit them more effectively, particularly when it comes to what we're teaching young people. And this larger battle for hearts and minds is going to be a generational struggle.  It's ultimately not going to be won or lost by the United States alone.  It will be decided by the countries and the communities that terrorists like ISIL target.  Its going to be up to Muslim communities, including scholars and clerics, to keep rejecting warped interpretations of Islam, and to protect their sons and daughters from recruitment.  It will be up to all people -- leaders and citizens -- to reject the sectarianism that so often fuels the resentments and conflicts upon which terrorists are currently thriving.  It will be up to governments to address the political and economic grievances that terrorists exploit. Nations that empower citizens to decide their own destiny, that uphold human rights for all their people, that invest in education and create opportunities for their young people -- those can be powerful antidotes to extremist ideologies.  Those are the countries that will find a true partner in the United States. In closing, let me note that this Fourth of July we celebrated 239 years of American independence.  Across more than two centuries, weve faced much bigger, much more formidable challenges than this -- Civil War, a Great Depression, fascism, communism, terrible natural disasters, 9/11.  And every time, every generation, our nation has risen to the moment.  We dont simply endure; we emerge stronger than before.  And that will be the case here. Our mission to destroy ISIL and to keep our country safe will be difficult.  It will take time.  There will be setbacks as well as progress.  But as President and Commander-in-Chief, I want to say to all our men and women in uniform who are serving in this operation -- our pilots, the crews on the ground, our personnel not only on the ground but at sea, our intelligence teams and our diplomatic teams -- I want to thank you.  We are proud of you, and you have my total confidence that youre going to succeed. To the American people, I want to say we will continue to be vigilant.  We will persevere.  And just as we have for more than two centuries, we will ultimately prevail. Thank you very much, everybody.  And thanks to the team up on the stage here with me -- theyre doing an outstanding job. Question:  Take a question? President Obama:  You know what, I will take a question.  Go ahead. Question:  Every servicemember who is listening to you today, Mr. President, is wondering, are you going to veto the defense bills that are going to pay me?  What is your latest thinking on that? Because we've heard secondhand through statements of policy that your advisors would threaten a veto.  Whats your take, sir?  Would you veto the appropriations bills? President Obama:  Our men and women are going to get paid.  And if youll note that I've now been President for six and a half years and we've had some wrangling with Congress in the past -- our servicemembers haven't missed a paycheck. But what is also important in terms of our budget is making sure that we are not short-changing all the elements of American power that allow us to secure the nation and to project our power around the world.  So what we're not going to do is to accept a budget that short-changes our long-term requirements for new technologies, for readiness.  We're not going to eat our seed corn by devoting too much money on things we don't need now and robbing ourselves of the capacity to make sure that we're prepared for future threats. I've worked very closely with the Chairman and the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a budget that is realistic and that looks out into the future and says this is how we're going to handle any possible contingency.  And we can't do that if we've got a budget that short-changes vital operations and continues to fund things that are not necessary. We also have to remind ourselves that the reason we have the best military in the world is, first and foremost, because we've got the best troops in history.  But it's also because we've got a strong economy, and we've got a well-educated population.  And we've got an incredible research operation and universities that allow us to create new products that then can be translated into our military superiority around the world.  We short-change those, we're going to be less secure. So the way we have to look at this budget is to recognize that, A, we can't think short term, we've got to think long term; and B, part of our national security is making sure that we continue to have a strong economy and that we continue to make the investments that we need in things like education and research that are going to be vital for us to be successful long term. Question:  As an Army reservist, I'm curious to know if you have any plans to send any more American troops overseas right now, any additional forces. President Obama:  There are no current plans to do so.  That's not something that we currently discussed.  I've always said that I'm going to do whats necessary to protect the homeland. One of the principles that we all agree on, though, and I pressed folks pretty hard because in these conversations with my military advisors I want to make sure I'm getting blunt and unadultered [sic] uncensored advice.  But in every one of the conversations that we've had, the strong consensus is that in order for us to succeed long-term in this fight against ISIL we have to develop local security forces that can sustain progress. It is not enough for us to simply send in American troops to temporarily set back organizations like ISIL, but to then, as soon as we leave, see that void filled once again with extremists.  It is going to be vital for us to make sure that we are preparing the kinds of local ground forces and security forces with our partners that can not only succeed against ISIL, but then sustain in terms of security and in terms of governance. Because if we try to do everything ourselves all across the Middle East, all across North Africa, we'll be playing Whack-a-Mole and there will be a whole lot of unintended consequences that ultimately make us less secure. All right?", "filename": "06July2015PentagonAddressonDefeatingtheIslamicState.txt"}, {"question": "He was a good man.  A man of character.  A man who loved deeply, and was loved in return. Your Eminences, your Excellencies, General Odierno, distinguished guests; to Hallie, Natalie and Hunter; to Hunter, Kathleen, Ashley, Howard; the rest of Beaus beautiful family, friends, colleagues; to Jill and to Joe -- we are here to grieve with you, but more importantly, we are here because we love you. Without love, life can be cold and it can be cruel.  Sometimes cruelty is deliberate -- the action of bullies or bigots, or the inaction of those indifferent to anothers pain.  But often, cruelty is simply born of life, a matter of fate or Gods will, beyond our mortal powers to comprehend. To suffer such faceless, seemingly random cruelty can harden the softest hearts, or shrink the sturdiest.  It can make one mean, or bitter, or full of self-pity.  Or, to paraphrase an old proverb, it can make you beg for a lighter burden. But if youre strong enough, it can also make you ask God for broader shoulders; shoulders broad enough to bear not only your own burdens, but the burdens of others; shoulders broad enough to shield those who need shelter the most. To know Beau Biden is to know which choice he made in his life.  To know Joe and the rest of the Biden family is to understand why Beau lived the life he did.  For Beau, a cruel twist of fate came early -- the car accident that took his mom and his sister, and confined Beau and Hunter, then still toddlers, to hospital beds at Christmastime. But Beau was a Biden.  And he learned early the Biden family rule:  If you have to ask for help, its too late.  It meant you were never alone; you dont even have to ask, because someone is always there for you when you need them. And so, after the accident, Aunt Valerie rushed in to care for the boys, and remained to help raise them.  Joe continued public service, but shunned the parlor games of Washington, choosing instead the daily commute home, maintained for decades, that would let him meet his most cherished duty -- to see his kids off to school, to kiss them at night, to let them know that the world was stable and that there was firm ground under their feet. As Joe himself confessed to me, he did not just do this because the kids needed him.  He did it because he needed those kids.  And somehow, Beau sensed that -- how understandably and deeply hurt his family and his father was.  And so, rather than use his childhood trauma as justification for a life of self-pity or self-centeredness, that very young boy made a very grown-up decision:  He would live a life of meaning.  He would live a life for others.  He would ask God for broader shoulders. Beau would guide and look out for his younger brother.  He would embrace his new mom -- apparently, the two boys sheepishly asking their father when they could all marry Jill -- and throughout his life, no one would make Jill laugh harder.  He would look after their baby sister, Ashley.  He would forever be the one to do the right thing, careful not to give his family or his friends cause for concern. Its no secret that a lot of what made Beau the way he was was just how much he loved and admired his dad.  He studied law, like his dad, even choosing the same law school.  He chased public service, like his dad, believing it to be a noble and important pursuit.  From his dad, he learned how to get back up when life knocked him down.  He learned that he was no higher than anybody else, and no lower than anybody else -- something Joe got from his mom, by the way.  And he learned how to make everybody else feel like we matter, because his dad taught him that everybody matters. He even looked and sounded like Joe, although I think Joe would be first to acknowledge that Beau was an upgrade -- Joe 2.0.  But as much as Beau reminded folks of Joe, he was very much his own man.  He was an original. Here was a scion of an incredible family who brushed away the possibility of privilege for the harder, better reward of earning his own way.  Here was a soldier who dodged glory, and exuded true humility.  A prosecutor who defended the defenseless.  The rare politician who collected more fans than foes, and the rarer public figure who prioritized his private life above all else. Beau didnt cut corners.  He turned down an appointment to be Delawares attorney general so he could win it fair and square.  When the field was clear for him to run for the Senate, he chose to finish his job as A.G. instead.  He didnt do these things to gain favor with a cynical public -- its just who he was.  In his twenties, he and a friend were stopped for speeding outside Scranton.  And the officer recognized the name on the license, and because he was a fan of Joes work with law enforcement he wanted to let Beau off with a warning.  But Beau made him write that ticket.  Beau didnt trade on his name. After 9/11, he joined the National Guard.  He felt it was his obligation -- part of what those broader shoulders are for.  He did his duty to his country and deployed to Iraq, and General Odierno eloquently spoke to Major Bidens service.  What I can tell you is when he was loading up to ship out at Dover, there was a lot of press that wanted to interview him. Beau refused.  He was just another soldier. I saw him when I visited Iraq; he conducted himself the same way.  His deployment was hard on Hallie and the kids, like it was for so many families over the last 14 years.  It was hard on Joe, hard on Jill.  Thats partly why Jill threw herself into her work with military families with so much intensity.  Thats how you know when Joe thunders may God protect our troops in every speech he does, he means it so deeply. Like his father, Beau did not have a mean bone in his body.  The cruelty hed endured in his life didnt make him hard, it made him compassionate, empathetic.  But it did make him abhor bullies. Beaus grandfather, Joes father, believed that the most egregious sin was to abuse your power to inflict pain on another.  So Beau squared his broad shoulders to protect people from that kind of abuse.  He fought for homeowners who were cheated, seniors who were scammed.  He even went after bullying itself.  He set up a Child Protector -- Predator Task Force, convicted more than 200 of those who targeted vulnerable children.  And in all this, he did it in a way that was alive to the suffering of others, bringing in experts to help spare both the children and their parents further trauma. Thats who Beau was.  Someone who cared.  Someone who charmed you, and disarmed you, and put you at ease.  When hed have to attend a fancy fundraiser with people who took themselves way too seriously, hed walk over to you and whisper something wildly inappropriate in your ear. The son of a senator, a Major in the Army, the most popular elected official in Delaware -- Im sorry, Joe -- but he was not above dancing in nothing but a sombrero and shorts at Thanksgiving if it would shake loose a laugh from the people he loved.  And through it all, he was the consummate public servant, a notebook in his back pocket at all times so he could write down the problems of everyone he met and go back to the office to get them fixed. Because he was a Biden, the titles that come with family -- husband, father, son, brother, uncle -- those were the ones Beau valued above any other.  This was a man who, at the Democratic National Convention, didnt spend all his time in backrooms with donors or glad-handing. Instead, he rode the escalators in the arena with his son, up and down, up and down, again and again, knowing, just like Joe had learned, what ultimately mattered in life. You know, anyone can make a name for themselves in this reality TV age, especially in todays politics.  If youre loud enough or controversial enough, you can get some attention.  But to make that name mean something, to have it associated with dignity and integrity -- that is rare. Theres no shortcut to get it.  Its not something you can buy.  But if you do right by your children, maybe you can pass it on.  And what greater inheritance is there?  What greater inheritance than to be part of a family that passes on the values of what it means to be a great parent; that passes on the values of what it means to be a true citizen; that passes on the values of what it means to give back, fully and freely, without expecting anything in return? Thats what our country was built on -- men like Beau.  Thats who built it -- families like this.  We dont have kings or queens or lords.  We dont have to be born into money to have an impact.  We dont have to step on one another to be successful.  We have this remarkable privilege of being able to earn what we get out of life, with the knowledge that we are no higher than anybody else, or lower than anybody else.  We know this not just because it is in our founding documents, but because families like the Bidens have made it so, because people like Beau have made it so. He did in 46 years what most of us couldnt do in 146.  He left nothing in the tank.  He was a man who led a life where the means were as important as the ends.  And the example he set made you want to be a better dad, or a better son, or a better brother or sister, better at your job, the better soldier.  He made you want to be a better person.  Isnt that finally the measure of a man -- the way he lives, how he treats others, no matter what life may throw at him? We do not know how long weve got here.  We dont know when fate will intervene.  We cannot discern Gods plan.  What we do know is that with every minute that weve got, we can live our lives in a way that takes nothing for granted.  We can love deeply.  We can help people who need help.  We can teach our children what matters, and pass on empathy and compassion and selflessness.  We can teach them to have broad shoulders. To the Biden family, this sprawling, intimate clan -- I know that Beaus passing has left a gaping void in the world.  Hallie, I can only imagine the burdens that youve been carrying on your shoulders these past couple of years.  And its because you gave him everything that he could give everything to us.  And just as you were there for him, well be there for you. To Natalie and Hunter -- there arent words big enough to describe how much your dad loved you, how much he loved your mom.  But I will tell you what, Michelle and I and Sasha and Malia, weve become part of the Biden clan.  Were honorary members now.  And the Biden family rule applies.  Were always here for you, we always will be -- my word as a Biden. To Joe and Jill -- just like everybody else here, Michelle and I thank God you are in our lives.  Taking this ride with you is one of the great pleasures of our lives.  Joe, you are my brother.  And Im grateful every day that youve got such a big heart, and a big soul, and those broad shoulders.  I couldnt admire you more. I got to know Joes mom, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, before she passed away.  She was on stage with us when we were first elected. And I know she told Joe once that out of everything bad that happens to you, something good will come if you look hard enough.  And I suppose she was channeling that same Irish poet with whom I began today, Patrick Kavanagh, when he wrote, And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day. As hard as it is right now, through all the heartache and through all the tears, it is our obligation to Beau to think not about what was and what might have been, but instead to think about what is, because of him. Think about the day that dawns for children who are safer because of Beau, whose lives are fuller, because of him.  Think about the day that dawns for parents who rest easier, and families who are freer, because of him.  Some folks may never know that their lives are better because of Beau Biden.  But thats okay.  Certainly for Beau, acclaim was never the point of public service. But the lines of well-wishers whove been here all week -- they know. The White House mailroom thats been overflowing with letters from people -- those folks know.  The soldiers who served with Beau, who joined the National Guard because of him.  The workers at Verdis who still have their home because of him, and who thanked him for helping them bus tables one busy night.  The students in Newark who remember the time he talked with them for hours, inexhaustible, even after giving a speech, even after taking his National Guard fitness test.  The Rehoboth woman whos saved a kind voicemail from him for five years, and wrote to say I loved the way he loved his family.  And the stranger who wrote from halfway across this great country just to say, The only thing we can hope for is that our children make us proud by making a difference in the world.  Beau has done that and then some.  The world noticed. Jill, Joe, Hallie, Hunter and Natalie -- the world noticed.  They noticed. They felt it, his presence.  And Beau lives on in the lives of others.  And isnt that the whole point of our time here?  To make this country we love fairer and more just, not just for Natalie and Hunter, or Naomi, or Finnegan, or Maisy, or Malia, or Sasha, but for every child?  Isnt that what this amazing journey weve been on is all about -- to make life better for the next generation?", "filename": "06June2015EulogyforBeauBidenIII.txt"}, {"question": "And let me just say, I make a lot of decisions; one of the earliest and best decisions I made was choosing one of the finest Vice Presidents in our history -- Joe Biden, right here. Chaplain Miller, thank you for the beautiful invocation. I want to thank General Colt for welcoming me here today, along with your great Command Sergeant Major, Wayne St. Louis. The Quartet and 101st Division Band. All these troopers behind me -- you look great. You noticed they kind of hesitated. We got a lot of folks in the house. Weve got military police and medical personnel. Weve got the Green Berets of the 5th Special Forces Group. I think weve got a few Air Force here. Oh -- Well, we thought we did.

Where are they at?", "filename": "06May2011SpeechtoTroopsatFortCampbell.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Michelle, I love you so much. A few nights ago, everybody was reminded just what a lucky man I am. The other night, I think the entire country saw just how lucky I am. Malia and Sasha, we are so proud of you. And yes, you do have to go to school in the morning. And Joe Biden, thank you for being the very best Vice President I could have ever hoped for, and being a strong and loyal friend. Madam Chairwoman, delegates, I accept your nomination for President of the United States. Now, the first time I addressed this convention in 2004, I was a younger man; a Senate candidate from Illinois who spoke about hope -- not blind optimism, not wishful thinking, but hope in the face of difficulty; hope in the face of uncertainty, that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward, even when the odds are great, even when the road is long. Eight years later, that hope has been tested -- by the cost of war, by one of the worst economic crises in history, and by political gridlock thats left us wondering whether its still even possible to tackle the challenges of our time. I know campaigns can seem small, even silly sometimes. Trivial things become big distractions. Serious issues become sound bites. The truth gets buried under an avalanche of money and advertising. If youre sick of hearing me approve this message, believe me, so am I. But when all is said and done -- when you pick up that ballot to vote -- you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation. Over the next few years, big decisions will be made in Washington -- on jobs, the economy, taxes and deficits, energy, education, war and peace -- decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our childrens lives for decades to come. And on every issue, the choice you face wont just be between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America; a choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future. Ours is a fight to restore the values that built the largest middle class and the strongest economy the world has ever known -- the values my grandfather defended as a soldier in Pattons Army, the values that drove my grandmother to work on a bomber assembly line while he was gone. They knew they were part of something larger -- a nation that triumphed over fascism and depression, a nation where the most innovative businesses turned out the worlds best products, and everyone shared in that pride and success -- from the corner office to the factory floor. My grandparents were given the chance to go to college, buy their own -- their own home, and fulfill the basic bargain at the heart of Americas story: the promise that hard work will pay off, that responsibility will be rewarded, that everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same rules -- from Main Street to Wall Street to Washington, D.C. And I ran for President because I saw that basic bargain slipping away. I began my career helping people in the shadow of a shuttered steel mill, at a time when too many good jobs were starting to move overseas. And by 2008, we had seen nearly a decade in which families struggled with costs that kept rising but paychecks that didnt, folks racking up more and more debt just to make the mortgage or pay tuition,  put gas in the car or food on the table. And when the house of cards collapsed in the Great Recession, millions of innocent Americans lost their jobs, their homes, their life savings -- a tragedy from which we're still fighting to recover. Now, our friends down in Tampa at the Republican convention were more than happy to talk about everything they think is wrong with America, but they didnt have much to say about how theyd make it right. They want your vote, but they dont want you to know their plan. And thats because all they have to offer is the same prescriptions theyve had for the last 30 years: \"Have a surplus? Try a tax cut.\" \"Deficit too high? Try another.\" \"Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!\" Now, Ive cut taxes for those who need it -- middle-class families, small businesses -- but I dont believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit. I dont believe that firing teachers or kicking students off financial aid will grow the economy, or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of China. After all weve been through, I dont believe that rolling back regulations on Wall Street will help the small businesswoman expand, or the laid-off construction worker keep his home. We have been there. Weve tried that. And were not going back. We are moving forward, America. Now, I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades. It'll require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. And by the way, those of us who carry on his party's legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government program or dictate from Washington. But know this, America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path we offer may be harder but it leads to a better place, and I'm asking you to choose that future. I'm asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country, goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security, and the deficit -- real, achievable plans that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity, and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation. That's what we can do in the next four years, and that is why I am running for a second term as President of the United States. We can choose a future where we export more products and outsource fewer jobs. After a decade that was defined by what we bought and borrowed, we're getting back to basics and doing what America's always done best. We are making things again. I've met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared they'd never build another American car; and today they can't build them fast enough because we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on the top of the world. I worked with business leaders who are bringing jobs back to America not because our workers make less pay, but because we make better products -- because we work harder and smarter than anyone else. I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers, goods that are stamped with three proud words: \"Made in America.\" And after a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two-and-half years. And now you have a choice: We can give more tax breaks to corporations that shift jobs overseas or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here in the United States of America. We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports. And if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years. You can make that happen. You can choose that future. You can choose the path where we control more of our own energy. After 30 years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. We have doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by one million barrels a day, more than any Administration in recent history. And today the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in the last two decades. So now you have a choice, between a strategy that reverses this progress or one that builds on it. We've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more. But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan or endanger our coastlines or collect another four billion dollars in corporate welfare from our taxpayers. We're offering a better path. We're offering a better path where we -- a -- a future where we keep investing in wind and solar and clean coal, where farmers and scientists harness new biofuels to power our cars and trucks, where construction workers build homes and factories that waste less energy, where -- where we develop a hundred-year supply of natural gas that's right beneath our feet. If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone. And yes, my plan will continue to reduce the carbon pollution that is heating our planet, because climate change is not a hoax. More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future. And in this election, you can do something about it. You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete, no matter how old they are or how much money they have. Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. It was -- It was the gateway for most of you. And now more than ever it is the gateway to a middle-class life. For the first time in a generation, nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning. Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading. Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders. And now you have a choice. We can gut education, or we can decide that in the United States of America, no child should have her dreams deferred because of a crowded classroom or a crumbling school. No family should have to set aside a college acceptance letter because they don't have the money. No company should have to look for workers overseas because they couldn't find any with the right skills here at home. That's not our future. That is not our future. A government has a role in this -- but teachers must inspire; principals must lead; parents must instill a thirst for learning; and students, you've got to do the work. And together, I promise you we can out-educate and outcompete any nation on earth. So help me. Help me recruit a hundred thousand math and science teachers within 10 years and improve early childhood education. Help give two million workers the chance to learn skills at their community college that will lead directly to a job. Help us work with colleges and universities to cut in half the growth of tuition costs over the next 10 years. We can meet that goal together. You can choose that future for America. That's our future. You know, in a world of new threats and new challenges, you can choose leadership that has been tested and proven. Four years ago I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have. We've blunted the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and in 2014, our longest war will be over. A new tower rises above the New York skyline; al-Qaida is on the path to defeat; and Osama bin Laden is dead. And tonight we pay tribute to the Americans who still serve in harm's way. We are forever in debt to a generation whose sacrifice has made this country safer and more respected. We will never forget you and so long as I'm Commander-in-Chief we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. When you take off the uniform, we will serve you as well as you've served us, because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job or a roof over their heads or the care that they need when they come home. Around the world, we've strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. We've reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers. From Burma to Libya to South Sudan, we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings -- men and women, Christians and Muslims and Jews. But for all the progress that we've made, challenges remain. Terrorist plots must be disrupted. Europe's crisis must be contained. Our commitment to Israel's security must not waver, and neither must our pursuit of peace. The Iranian government must face a world that stays united against its nuclear ambitions. The historic change sweeping across the Arab world must be defined not by the iron fist of a dictator or the hate of extremists, but by the hopes and aspirations of ordinary people who are reaching for the same rights that we celebrate here today. So now we have a choice. My opponent and his running mate are new to foreign policy. But from all that we've seen and heard, they want to take us back to an era of blustering and blundering that cost America so dearly. After all, you don't call Russia our number one enemy1 -- not al-Qaida, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp. You might not be ready for diplomacy with Beijing if you can't visit the Olympics without insulting our closest ally. My opponent -- My opponent said that it was tragic to end the war in Iraq. And he won't tell us how he'll end the war in Afghanistan. Well, I have, and I will. And while my opponent would spend more money on military hardware that our Joint Chiefs don't even want, I will use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work -- rebuilding roads and bridges, and schools and runways, because after two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, it's time to do some nation building right here at home. You can choose a future where we reduce our deficit without sticking it to the middle class. Independent experts say that my plan would cut our deficit by four trillion dollars. And last summer I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut a billion dollars in spending, because those of us who believe government can be a force for good should work harder than anyone to reform it so that it's leaner and more efficient and more responsive to the American people. I want to reform the tax code so it's simple, fair, and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over 250,000 dollars -- the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was President, the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history and a whole lot of millionaires to boot. Now, I'm still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission. No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. I want to get this done, and we can get it done. But when Governor Romney and his friends in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficits by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy, well -- what'd Bill Clinton call it? You do the arithmetic. You do the math. I refuse to go along with that, and as long as I'm President I never will. I refuse to ask middle-class families to give up their deductions for owning a home or raising their kids just to pay for another millionaire's tax cut. I refuse to ask students to pay more for college or kick children out of Head Start programs to eliminate health insurance for millions of Americans who are poor and elderly or disabled -- all so those with the most can pay less. I'm not going along with that. And I will never -- I will never turn Medicare into a voucher. No American should ever have to spend their golden years at the mercy of insurance companies. They should retire with the care and the dignity that they have earned. Yes, we will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more. And we will keep the promise of Social Security by taking the responsible steps to strengthen it, not by turning it over to Wall Street. This is the choice we now face. This is what the election comes down to. Over and over, we've been told by our opponents that bigger tax cuts and fewer regulations are the only way, that since government can't do everything, it should do almost nothing. If you can't afford health insurance, hope that you don't get sick. If a company releases toxic pollution into the air your children breathe, well, that's the price of progress. If you can't afford to start a business or go to college, take my opponent's advice and borrow money from your parents.

Welcome back. President Obama:  It is good to be back.    It is good to be back.  As some of you may know, I actually spent 10 years teaching classes and seminars here, and it was really fun.   And I missed it.  And I thought, well, why don't I come back and say hi to everybody. So there are a couple of people I want to acknowledge because they helped to facilitate this.  First of all, I want to thank Dean Miles for closing down the school, I guess, for a day.   Thank you.  Special acknowledgements for Geoff Stone and Doug Baird, who were great friends when I was teaching here and were partly responsible for having me actually take on some responsibility straight out of law school to mold the minds of students who were just barely younger than me.  I know that because some of them I saw and they all have gray hair now -- which is a little troubling. We've got a terrific congressional delegation whos here, and I just want to acknowledge them.  First of all, your outstanding senior Senator for the great state of Illinois, Dick Durbin is here.    And we've got Congressman Bobby Rush.    Congressman Danny Davis.    Congressman Bill Foster.    And Congressman Mike Quigley.    We also have Lisa Madigan, the Attorney General of Illinois.    And my former seatmate in Springfield when we were both in the State Senate together, and is doing a terrific job.  And I want to thank David, who I was joking before we came out, is one of the countrys foremost constitutional experts -- and a nice guy.    And you guys are lucky to have him. In fact, when I was teaching here I think I stole his Con Law class for a while, and he graciously gave it up because despite the privilege of grading 60 or 70 bluebooks -- he apparently thought it was important for me to have that privilege as well.  The last thing I'll say by way of introduction -- I had a chance to talk to some young people over in the overflow room, mostly students, and I just said to them that having now been in politics for quite some time, seeing what lawyers are capable of doing every single day, working on a whole range of issues that are of huge importance to our democracy and to our society, I hope that all the students here are excited about the incredible changes and good that you are going to be able to do when you get out of here.  I know that sometimes the news feeds cynicism and democracy at this moment seems particularly frustrating.  But each and every day, I see lawyers not that much older than you who are helping young people get an education, are making sure that consumers are protected, are helping to keep America safe, are ensuring that our health care system works for everybody, are helping to preserve the planet and fight against climate change. It is remarkable what you can do with your talents.  And it doesnt always get a lot of publicity, but you can make a really meaningful difference. So one of the reasons I wanted to come back is to recruit you.  To stay engaged, get involved, make a difference.  It doesnt mean you have to run for office.  It doesn't mean you have to run for office.  It doesn't mean you even have to work for government.  There are a lot of ways of serving.  But I do hope that one of the things that you will take away from our discussion today and your extraordinary education here at the University of Chicago is the incredible high that you can get from serving this country. So with that, what do you want to talk about, David?  Professor Strauss:  Well, let me start back when you were here as a teacher.  I know you taught constitutional law, so you were thinking about the Supreme Court and thinking about the justices and what would make someone -- or what make someone a great justice or a successful justice.  But you're in a different spot now.    Has your thinking changed? President Obama:  Surprisingly, not as much as you would have expected.  Obviously, we're having a substantial argument in Washington right now about not just a particular judge, but also about the process of appointing judges to the federal courts and appointing nominees to the Supreme Court. And to get this out of the way, Merrick Garland is an extraordinary jurist who is indisputably qualified to serve on the highest court in the land.  And nobody really argues otherwise.  I just want to be clear here.  If the question is qualifications and excellence, it is uniformly viewed by not just Democrats but also Republicans, those who have served -- lawyers, judges, legal scholars, members of the current Supreme Court -- that he is as good of a judge as we have in this country right now.  That hes fair, hes smart, hes objective.  Hes a consensus builder.  He shows judicial restraint.  Hes appreciative of the unique role of the Court, but also respectful of the role of the other branches of government. So no one has plausibly made an argument that this is not the kind of person wed want on the Supreme Court.  The question then becomes, why is it so hard for the guy just to get a hearing and a vote? And this speaks to whats happened, generally, when it comes to the process of appointing federal judges.  It used to be that people read the Constitution and Article II powers fairly straightforwardly.  It says the President shall make these nominations with the advice and consent of the Senate.  And unless there was some sort of real problem with that judges character or qualifications, it was fairly routine at every level -- both at the district court level, the appellate court level, and the Supreme Court -- that the person would be confirmed in short order.  There would be a hearing.  People would ask the potential judge a question or two or five or 10.  There would be questionnaires.  And once they had satisfactorily performed that process, then the Senate would vote. And it was presumed -- it was understood that just as the President had a constitutional duty to make the appointment that the Senate had a constitutional duty to at least make a determination as to whether this person should be on the bench. What has been unique in this process has been the growing attitude inside of the Senate that every nomination, no matter how well-qualified a judge, is a subject of contention.  In some cases, its simply because one party or the other wants to gum up the works and so they will drag out confirmation longer and longer.  Even if, ultimately, the judge gets confirmed by voice vote, by unanimous consent in the Senate, theyll drag it out for two or three months, because if you're bogged down with judges, then it means other business can't be done.  So sometimes its just strategic. In other cases, the view has been that despite all the talk about people wanting objective judges who are just calling balls and strikes and don't bring any views to bear, that there are litmus tests that are applied that prevent a judge from getting a fair vote, even though they're qualified, because they don't meet the particular views of the party that's objecting. And this problem got bad enough in previous administrations, but came to a head under my administration, in which we had a situation where we were starting to see six months pass or nine months pass before a judge could get a hearing.  This was when Democrats were in charge of the Senate, but because of the particular rules of the filibuster that previously had been used for just a few things but now were routinely deployed on everything, we just couldnt get judges through.  And you started seeing a crisis in vacancies across districts and circuits everywhere. Finally, the Democrats said, we're ending the ability for Senate members to filibuster when it comes to district court and appellate court justices, but we're going to preserve it for the Supreme Court. We now have a situation, after Judge Scalias passing, in which its not just that the Republican majority in the Senate intend to vote against a highly qualified judge, we now have a situation where they're saying, we simply will not consider the nomination itself.  We're just going to shut down the process.  And as a consequence, we have a 4-4 tie in the Supreme Court and potentially at least two Supreme Court terms in which this vacancy will remain. That is unprecedented.  Not only are they not willing to hold a vote at this point, they have refused to hold hearings on Judge Garland.  And in some cases, Mitch McConnell and others have said, we will not even show the courtesy of meeting with the judge to find out what he thinks.  And I think whats important for all of you to understand -- because you're going to be not just lawyers appearing in court, potentially, but custodians of our legal system and our democracy -- is if you start getting into a situation in which the process of appointing judges is so broken, so partisan that an eminently qualified jurist cannot even get a hearing, then we are going to see the kinds of sharp, partisan polarization that has come to characterize our electoral politics seeping entirely into the judicial system.  And the courts will be just an extension of our legislatures and our elections and our politics. And that erodes the institutional integrity of the judicial branch.  At that point, people lose confidence in the ability of the courts to fairly adjudicate cases and controversies.  And our democracy can't afford that.  Our system is designed to make sure that this branch works.  And it requires a broad consensus, even if we don't agree on any particular ruling, that the courts rulings itself are legitimate and consistent with our democratic design.  And that's why this is so important.  Its not just a matter of who is occupying that ninth seat in the Supreme Court. It has to do with how we, as a democracy, operate, and the particular authority that a court has to bring in order for our democracy to work. That was a really long answer.  Others will not be as long.  Professor Strauss:  Well, let me ask you about that, Mr. President.  How did we get to this point?  You hear sometimes that the problem is the Supreme Court has injected itself into political issues, and so, of course, it gets enmeshed in politics.  But the Supreme Court has been controversial almost from the beginning -- from the Jeffersonians attack on the Marshall Court, all the way through the Impeach Earl Warren billboards in parts of the country in the 50s and 60s.  And we havent had this before.  So is there -- do you have an explanation for what it is that brought us to this position? President Obama:  I think there are a variety of explanations. First of all, its important to underscore what you just said.  And all of you law students, even if you're not critical, legal theorists, or what have you, I think just from reading cases, you will acknowledge that theres politics in legal rulings.  When we make decisions about right, wrong, what are the rules governing our society, et cetera, that that's an extension of our broader political and democratic conversation.  Nobody is denying that. And you're right.  There have been controversies in the past about how we should decide the balance between liberty and security, about how do we treat minority groups to assure that they are protected from majority rule.  How do we make sure that the political process itself has integrity and that our votes count?  Those are all issue where passions are real and people have opinions.  And theres nothing wrong with that. But I think what changed was when the Congress itself, and the Senate in particular, began to change.  I think in some ways the judicial process is a casualty of some broader trends in our democracy.  First of all, our politics have become much more polarized.  Theres been something called the great sorting because of gerrymandering, because of how our media works where folks either watch Fox News or they read The New York Times, but rarely do both.  Positions get hardened and reinforced.  Partisans carry more weight within each party.  The notion of a liberal Republican or a conservative Democrat -- those things broke down.  And so politics itself got more polarized. That, then, fed into a culture in Congress in which basic comity and habits of courtesy and process and institutional respect for people that you can agree with, those things began to break down.  The filibuster, as I said, started becoming just standard practice.  Theres nothing in the Constitution that says every item that comes before the Senate is supposed to get a super majority.  It used to be that the filibuster -- it doesnt have a very distinguished history -- was used principally for blocking civil rights and anti-lynching and voting rights legislation.  That was bad enough.  It then suddenly became the norm for everything as minority parties started to decide that they wanted to block what the majority of senators were in favor of.  And so all of this I think contributed to a breakdown of the process. Now, in fairness, Democrats are not blameless on this.  If you talk to Republicans, theyll also often point to the Bork nomination as where this all started.  And there have been times where Democrats used the filibuster to block what Republican Presidents or conservative legal theorists viewed as eminently qualified jurists.  I will say that there has not been a circumstance in which a Republican Presidents appointee did not get a hearing, did not get a vote, and as a general proposition, they have been confirmed even where there have been strong objections.  So what you have here is, I think, a circumstance in which those in the Senate have decided that placating our base is more important than upholding their constitutional and institutional roles in our democracy in a way that is dangerous.  And there are other examples of it, but this judicial nomination process I think has become an extreme example. Professor Strauss:  Let me take you back a step to how -- to your thinking about when you're making an appointment.  And I'm going to try to put it in an historical context a little bit.  You have Presidents who really set out to reshape the Court.  And Franklin Roosevelt may be the clearest example.  He was determined to find justices who would uphold New Deal legislation.  Richard Nixon wanted justices who would limit the rights of people accused of crimes, and that's sort of one model. And then you have Presidents who did not have any particular agenda.  And I think President Eisenhower is an example.  He appointed three of the great justices of the 20th century -- Chief Justice Warren, Justice Harlan, Justice Brennan.  But his appointees came from different backgrounds, no identifiable tendency in the way they thought about the Constitution.  So do you see yourself as one of those models, or something different from both? President Obama:  Theres no doubt that in making my appointments, the values of the justice matter to me.  And what I mean by that is not how theyd rule on a particular issue.  In fact, we're very careful when I interview candidates not to ask them about a particular case or controversy that might make it seem as if I want a particular outcome.  But what I've been consistently looking for -- and this is what I saw in Justice Sotomayor, what I saw in Justice Kagan -- is people who, number one, have intellectual integrity.  And what that means is, is that they look at the facts and the law, and even if it's uncomfortable to them, they don't like the outcome, they follow the law, and they recognize that that's their job. Number two, that they bring a humanity to the job.  And what I mean by that is that, particularly on the Supreme Court, nine out of 10 cases -- well, certainly in the federal courts -- nine out of 10 cases we can probably arrive at an outcome just by applying basic tenets to constitutional interpretation.  Theres not going to be a lot of controversy.  The cases that really matter are the ones where theres ambiguity, where theres a lack of clarity, where it requires constitutional principles being applied in a way that is true to precedent, is true to basic legal tenets, but also that understands the unique role of the Court in making sure that people who are locked out of the political process, for example, are not permanently locked out, that they have some recourse; that we have justices who understand how the world works so that they are not entirely blind to the history of racial discrimination or gender discrimination, or how money operates in our world.  Not because that necessarily leads them to rule on a particular issue, but because it means that when theyre looking at a tough case in which statute or the Constitution does not provide an immediate, ready answer, that they can apply judgment, grounded in how we actually live and the ideals and principles that have made this such an extraordinary country.  I want them to have lived a little and be able to see the wide spectrum of people that theyre going to be wielding this enormous power over. And so, a lot of times when I talk to the candidates for the judiciary, I spend time asking about their families and them growing up, and what were formative experiences in their minds.  And in some ways, that reveals more than anything.  And part of the reason that I think Merrick Garland would be such an extraordinary judge is not just because hes already been an extraordinary judge, but I think about his life story.  And I mentioned this in the introduction -- when he was a high school kid, as class valedictorian, hes got a student speaking ahead of him who lambasts the Vietnam War, and parents are trying to unplug the guys mic, and Merrick comes in and -- not because he necessarily agrees with the student, but, impromptu, provides a vigorous defense of free speech.  As a 17- or 18-year-old kid -- that tells me something about him.  It gives me confidence that this is somebody whos thought about what our core values and ethics are as a society.  When you hear about the work he did in the Oklahoma City bombing, and hes presiding over the investigation at the Justice Department, and the fact that he was meticulous in how he conducted that investigation, and didnt cut corners -- even though, in the wake of those kinds of terrorist attacks, oftentimes it's convenient, because people aren't going to call you on it, to cut corners -- and at the same time, how he kept the program mourning the deceased from the memorial because he knew that each one of those people who had been killed, and each one of those families had been affected in such profound ways -- that tells me something about who he is. And that, as much as anything, I think is going to give me confidence that that's the kind of person where, if I'm before a judge, I want to make sure that I've got somebody whos wise and who cares about people and is not arbitrary, and can provide confidence to the justice system.  And I also think part of the reason I thought Merrick was ideal now is precisely because of all the polarization we were talking about earlier.  What a good moment for us to have somebody who is respected by both sides, and who Chief Justice Roberts served with on the Appellate Court and befriended, and consistently said -- despite being on the opposite ends of a bunch of decisions -- said this is somebody who, if he says you're wrong, youve got to think long and hard about it.  He embodies and models what it is that we want to see in our juris prudence. Professor Strauss:  Let me sort of pick up on that.  I mean, as you know, some people on the left were disappointed with your choice of Chief Judge Garland.  They thought you should have appointed someone who would be more aggressive in moving the Court in a certain direction.  And I just -- I guess what I want to say is, those of us who knew you back then could have said you shouldnt be surprised, because if I remember correctly -- and correct me if I don't -- when you were teaching constitutional law, there are people in that line of work who hold up the Warren Court as the model and say the Courts job is to be really on the front lines of attacking societys problems. And if I remember correctly, you were skeptical of that when you were a law professor.  So am I right in remembering that, and has the skepticism carried over? President Obama:  No, no, I think you're right about this.  It's an adage in con law, and you're familiar with this -- probably the students are too -- that the courts are a terrific shield, but theyre not always a very effective sword.  And what I mean by that is, is that there have been moments in history -- Brown v. Board of Education being the best example, and on the other end of the spectrum, a decision like Dred Scott, which was antithetical to what we want to see a court do -- there are certain moments where, like in Brown, that democracy has broken down in a fundamental way.  The majority has shut down access for the petitions for redress from a minority group.  There are times where an individual who is engaging in, lets say, highly unpopular speech is not going to be able, through the political process, to uphold the values that we, collectively, have decided are pretty important to uphold. And so, in those circumstances, I have a very progressive view of how the courts should operate.  But as I think Judge Garland said, being a federal judge doesnt mean that you have this broad writ to simply remake society.  Ideally, youve got a political process that does that; that we argue about issues, and we elect representatives, and we get votes, and we pass bills, and we get a new administration and they overturn stuff that we passed.  And it's rough, and it's tumble, and it's not always elegant, but that's the constitutional design.  And it has the benefit of making sure that separation of powers and decentralization of power in our society keeps this lumbering ship moving in a pretty good direction. And so it's been rare -- and this is by design -- that the Court engages in massive social engineering.  Now, I care deeply about -- there are a whole range of progressive causes that I will continue to fight for as long as I have a breath.  I believe in a society that is doing something about climate change in an aggressive way.  I believe in a society in which every child is able to get a decent education and opportunity.  I believe that everybody should have health care in a society that's wealthy -- it's not a privilege, it's a right.    I believe that our criminal justice system is flawed in a whole range of ways. A couple of weeks ago, or maybe it was last week, I had lunch with a sampling of the people that I've pardoned for nonviolent drug offenses.  And I've got a woman sitting next to me who, at a very young age, in her early 20s, was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent drug offense.  That's crazy.  It makes no sense.  It was unjust and counterproductive, and leaves huge scars not just in that womans family and her children, but in our society as a whole. So there are a whole bunch of things I've done as President and I intend to continue to do and to advocate for.  Those are not things, though, that typically a Supreme Court justice is in the position to get done.  They don't have taxing power.  They don't necessarily have the expertise to be designing programs to get at the things that we care about.  And so I do have a modesty in terms of my expectations for what the Court should do. But I want the court to do what it should do really well.  I want a court that does believe that equality under the law is equality under the law -- not just the words, but that it is operationalized, that it's real.  I want a court that is treating a poor indigent criminal defendant the same as a wealthy criminal defendant, and that justice is blind with respect to -- she agrees with me.    So modesty in the scope and the nature of what the law is, but doing really well what the Court is designed to do -- that's what I'm looking for in a justice. Professor Strauss:  I think we can open it up.  President Obama:  Lets open it up to questions.  There you go, a little Socratic method here.    State the case!   No, I'm teasing.  I'm teasing.  This young lady right here in the green -- yes.  Do we have a mic?  Lets give them mics so everybody can hear you.  Introduce yourself, by the way. Question:  Hi. President Obama:  Hi. Question:  My name is Amelia. President Obama:  Hey, Amelia. Question:  I actually had the opportunity to ask you a question when I was 15 years old, in New Hampshire.  President Obama:  Wow.    Question:  So I'm really happy to -- President Obama:  Are you a student here now? Question:  I am. President Obama:  That's very cool.  Did I answer your question the last time? Question:  You did, very well.    President Obama:  Thank goodness.  All right, what do you got? Question:  So I'm really happy to hear that you said you were going to continue to push for the issues that you care about, because I, of course, believe that the push for the Supreme Court nomination is incredibly important.  I'm just a little concerned that other issues could get left behind.  One such issue, for example, is criminal justice reform -- specifically, the problem of mass incarceration.  So I was wondering if you could speak to what more youll do in your last 10 months to address this issue. President Obama:  Great.  It's a great question.  We're in this really interesting moment where generally Congress is thoroughly unproductive -- not, by the way, because of the members of Congress who are here -- who are all doing great work -- but in the aggregate its not doing much.  One exception has been this growing interest, this movement in criminal justice reform.  And its bipartisan and its sincere on the part of all sides on this.  And its an interest convergence.  You have fiscal conservatives who have been seeing how expensive it is to incarcerate people year after year after year, and how its breaking the bank -- particularly at the state level, where if you track spending on public education and spending on incarceration over the last 25, 30 years, there is almost a direct line between more people in jail and less support for public universities, for example.  So theres a fiscal concern. You've got a libertarian strand of conservatives who really believe why is it the governments business if somebody is taking -- smoking pot, lets say, and why would we want to jail them for 20 years?  You've got a very sincere evangelical movement that oftentimes is involved in reentry programs or prison ministries, and so have embraced the idea of a second chance.  And so you combine that with law enforcement that I think has begun to recognize that a lot of how we have prosecuted the war on drugs has been unproductive, and that recidivism is inevitable if people are getting no skills.  They're incarcerated for decades, and then we're just releasing them with no possible support.  And then the long-standing progressive view that a lot of our criminal justice system has been tainted by racial discrimination and class bias.  All those things are converging. And so now we've got some really interesting coalitions.  Youve got the ACLU and the Koch brothers agreeing on this, which does not happen often.    Dick Durbin has been one of the key leaders in the Senate in shaping a criminal justice reform bill that has a real chance of passage.  And I think its really important to understand the nomination process with Judge Garland is not holding back our ability to move forward. It would be one thing if Mitch McConnell was saying, man, its going to take so long to schedule all the hearings and the votes, and we wont have time because we're just so busy that we can't then do criminal justice instead.  But since there has been a spike in the number of days off in this Congress, and, typically, a judicial confirmation takes less than three months from the time that person is nominated -- Judge Alito, for example, took 82 days -- this is something that shouldnt prevent us from getting done the criminal justice issues. I think whats been tougher is just managing the traditional politics around being soft on crime versus being tough on crime.  And right now because crime rates -- sadly except for in certain neighborhoods in Chicago and a few other cities -- have been going down in ways that are remarkable and nobody can fully explain, there is less profit in saying Im going to be tough on crime. But there is always a hesitance on the part of legislators because very rarely is a politician punished for having been too tough on crime and sentencing.  But occasionally,  la Willie Horton, they feel that a vote that can be perceived as lenient might come back to bite them. The good news is that, so far at least, people have stuck with it.  And Im modestly optimistic that we can get something done this year.  It wont solve the problem of mass incarceration -- because that was a process that took 20, 30 years to get to where we are now, where we account for 5 percent of the worlds population and 25 percent of the worlds prisoners, so its going to take some time to reverse.  But the legislation that's pending right now provides meaningful reductions in the standards for sentencing around nonviolent drug crimes.  It does some very important work in terms of reentry, diversion programs.  It breaks this psychology that we just have to lock people up in order to keep ourselves safe. One last element to this that has been interesting is the opioids crisis that some of you may have read about.  Right now painkillers -- overdoses of people taking painkillers kills more people than traffic accidents.  Its a remarkable statistic.  There has been this huge spike in painkiller addiction, which is then leading to heroin addiction, because oftentimes heroin is cheaper than painkillers.  And four out of five people who get addicted to heroin start their addiction with OxyContin or some other painkiller addiction.  And unlike crack, its not just affecting inner-city African American or Latino communities.  Its widespread.  Its pervasive.  Its seeping into rural areas. And its a tragic issue that we are really spending a lot of time focused on. But whats interesting is, is that the politics of this changes a little bit where when elected officials see kids who are like their kids getting hooked and going through these terrible things, theres been a greater predisposition to think of this as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice and incarceration issue. And that's -- Im just being blunt -- that's the truth.  But it actually has had an impact in terms of an openness I think to re-examining some of our drug laws. Good question.  Im sure your question eight years ago was really good, too.  All right, Im going to go boy-girl-boy-girl just to make sure this is fair.  We monitor these things.     Yes, gentleman right here, in the tie.  You.  Yes, you look sharp.    Do you wear a tie every day to class?  That's good, man. Question:  Im Jimmy.  Im also a 1L.  Ive never asked you a question before.  President Obama:  Okay. Question:  So this might not go very well.    But Ive written it down so hopefully I can read it.  Mr. President, we are currently in the midst of a polarizing, political election cycle dividing both major parties along populist and establishment fault lines.  Do you anticipate this divergence within the Democratic Party widening to the extent we saw with the tea partys emergence within the ranks of the Republican Party?  And if not, what do you worry about for the future of the Democratic Party? President Obama:  Short answer is, no, I don't.  The cleavages inside the Democratic Party are not comparable to what we're seeing in the Republican Party right now.  The argument inside the Democratic Party is a little bit more about means, less about ends.  If you look at our two Democratic candidates, they believe that everybody should get health care.  They believe that every child should get a good education.  They believe that climate change is real and that we should do something about it.  They believe in equality for the LGBT community.  Right?  If you go through the list, theres not a huge divergence there. I think that in the Democratic Party, there is a populist impulse that grows out of what I also think has happened for folks who are voting in the Republican primary, this frustration in the wake of the financial crisis and the bottom falling out for people who lost their jobs, or lost their homes, or lost their pensions; that the world is moving fast, the ground is not firm under their feet.  And even before that crisis, wages and incomes were not going up at the same pace as productivity, corporate profits, and so forth.  And so there is a sense the game is rigged.  And we have to more fundamentally change that game, that system -- whether its Wall Street, or how Washington operates, or what have you. Some of that impulse is healthy.  I think you want people to be asking hard questions about injustice economically and the way that insiders in the political process may not fully represent the interest of everyone. The danger, whether for Democrats or Republicans, is in a closed-loop system where everybody is just listening to the people who agree with them, that you start thinking the way to get to where I want to go is to simply be as uncompromising as possible, and hold the line, and not pay attention or listen to what the other side has to say.  And that is sort of a tea party mentality.  And that anybody who suggests, well, theres another point of view, or theres a whole half of the country that completely disagrees with us that we have to work with, well, then you must be a sellout, or you must be corrupted, or you must be on the take, or what have you. And that is not, I think, useful.  Its not say that there isnt corruption, that there isnt compromise -- people compromising principles for less-than-noble means, et cetera.  Those things happen and they should be called out. But a lot of the reason why a lot of Democrats who supported me and still support me got frustrated is because a bunch of the country doesn't agree with me or them, and they have votes, too, and they elect members of Congress.  And that's how our democracy works.  Its not a situation, if you don't get everything you want, its always because the person you elected sold you out.  It may just be because in our system you send up taking half loaves.  I could not be prouder of the Affordable Care Act, but it was a messy process.  It doesn't have a public option.  Its not single-payer.  If I were designing a system from scratch, I would have designed a more elegant system and a more efficient system.  But that's not what was possible in our democracy -- in the same way that Social Security when it first started was a meagerly program providing benefits to just a few people and historically cut out for purely racist reasons domestic servants or sharecroppers or what have you.  And then over time you kept on improving it.  That's how change generally happens. And I think the thing that Democrats have to guard against is going in the direction that the Republicans are much further along on, and that is this sense of we are just going to get our way, and if we don't, then we'll cannibalize our own and then kick them out and try again, and we narrow our viewpoints more and more until finally we stake out positions that are so extreme that they alienate the broad public. I don't see that being where the Democrats go.  But it's always something that we have to pay attention to. Question:  Thank you so much for being here.  I'd like to know how have your views on the Supreme Court nomination process changed since you taught constitutional law here at the University of Chicago. President Obama:  My views on how it should work hasnt changed.  My views on how it currently works obviously are a source of frustration.  Look, just to kind of wrap up this Supreme Court conversation, I think it is perfectly acceptable for Republicans to decide that even though Merrick Garland is highly qualified, even though hes indisputably a good and fair judge, even though hes gotten the highest ratings from all the bar organizations and others that have examined his record, that I just don't agree with him on X, Y, Z, and I'm going to vote against him because I believe in something different on important issues.  Whats not acceptable is not giving him a vote, not giving him a hearing, not meeting with him.  Whats not acceptable, I believe, is the increasing use of the filibuster for somebody whos clearly within the mainstream, or to essentially say that we are going to nullify the ability of a President who is from another party from making an appointment.  And we're going to wait to see if maybe we can get a guy from our party to make the appointment.  That is where you have a process foul that corrodes the ability of the Court to function effectively.  If you play out how much of a problem this could end up being -- if, in fact, Mitch McConnell sticks to not giving a hearing and not giving a vote, and lets say, from their perspective, everything works out great and their nominee, whoever that might be, wins and takes over the White House, and they, then, make an appointment -- the notion that Democrats would then say, oh, well, we'll just go along with that -- that is inconceivable.  Right? So now the Democrats say, well, whats good for the goose is good for the gander, we'll wait four more years to see how the next President comes in, at which point whats most likely then is Mitch McConnell will then eliminate the filibuster possibility for Supreme Court justices, as it was eliminated for the other judicial appointments.  And now it's just a majoritarian exercise inside the Senate of who controls the presidency and who controls the Senate.  And if different parties control the White House and the Senate during that period of time, you're not going to get any appointments done -- which is a disaster for the courts, generally.  For two reasons.  One is, theres a lot of work that needs to get done and you need judges.  And right now, there are emergency situations in districts across the country.  But the second thing that happens is people will, at that point, just become more and more cynical about decisions that are coming down from the Court.  Theyre already cynical because so much of so many opinions just end up being straight 5-4, and it starts feeling like this is just a partisan alignment.  But it gets much worse under these circumstances.  People then just view the courts as an extension of our political parties -- polarized political parties.  And if confidence in the courts consistently breaks down, then you start seeing our attitudes about democracy generally starting to break down, a legitimacy breaking down in ways that are very dangerous.  It's a gentlemans turn.  Right here in the front.  I am impressed by the way you guys did all get dressed up.    Was there a memo sent out?  Did the Dean say, you guys, we want you to all -- because you aren't going to class like this.    I know.  I remember.    Question:  Hello, Mr. President.  Thank you very much for being here with us today.  I'm a 2L here at the law school.  My question for you is, what sorts of constitutional questions were at the forefront of your mind when deciding who your nominee should be?  And what sorts of constitutional questions do you think Americans should be asking themselves when assessing your selection and thinking about the 2016 presidential election? President Obama:  Well, I will tell you, as I said before, I'm very careful not to delve too specifically into a candidates position on live issues.  You're a well-informed 2L, you know the issues that people debate.  Theres a standard set of social issues that have been roiling society and the courts for a long time -- whether it's LGBT rights, or abortion, or civil rights.  Whats interesting is there are a set of new issues that are going to be coming up that, for your generation, I think are going to be increasingly salient.  One great example is this whole debate around encryption, which I think is just the tip of the iceberg of what we're going to have to figure out.  In a society in which so much of your life is digitized, people have a whole new set of privacy expectations that are understandable.  They also expect, though, that since their lives are all digitized, that the digital world is safe, which creates a contradictory demand on government -- protect me from hackers, protect me from terrorists, protect me from et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, but I don't want you to know any of your [sic] business and I don't even want you to have the ability to investigate some of that business when it happens because theres broader implications and we're worried about Big Brother.  And so theres going to be a whole series of issues around that that I think will be coming up. I think there are a range of economic issues that date back very far, to the earliest days of the Court and were prominent during the Great Depression and FDRs era that have gone into abeyance -- people don't pay attention to them as much in terms of monopoly concentration, or antitrust issues, et cetera -- but I think in this current environment are going to be coming more prominent over time. And then, political participation issues and voting issues I think, and money in politics issues -- that's a whole series of issues that I do believe are an important role for the Court to play.  Because if we're not effectively setting the rules of the political process, if that is delegitimized, then whatever outcomes are generated are subject to just endless contention.  And this is separate from the judiciary.  This is your President editorializing.    We really are the only advanced democracy on Earth that systematically and purposely makes it really hard for people to vote.  And we sort of take it for granted.  I mean, we sort of just assume, yeah, that's I guess how it is.  Theres no other country on Earth that does that.  And theres a legacy to that that grows directly out of a history in which first property men, then white men, then white folks didnt want women, minorities to participate in the political process and be able to empower themselves in that fashion. Now, that's the history.  We should be a society in which, at this point, we said, yeah, that history wasnt so good, that's not who we are, and there was a Civil War fought about all this stuff, and we passed a whole series of laws like the Voting Rights Act, and at this point we should be at the point where we say, you know what, we want everybody to vote because that's the essence of our democracy.  But we have not just federal laws, but state laws, that unabashedly discourage people from voting -- which is why we have some of the lowest voting rates of any advanced democracy in the world.  And that's a problem.  That's not something that -- I'm saying that to Congress, as well as to the presidency, as well as to governors, as well as state legislators, as well as to courts. That can't be right!  Theres no justification for that!  You can't defend it!  And I've always said -- and this goes back to the young mans question earlier about political polarization -- maybe the single biggest change that we could make in our political process that would reduce some of the polarization, make people feel more invested, restore integrity to the system, would be just make sure everybody is voting.  Australia has got mandatory voting.  You start getting 70-80 percent voting rates, that's transformative. All right.  How much time do we have, by the way?  How many? Moderator:  Time for one more. President Obama:  We'll take two.  The young lady in the green, right there in the sweater.  Yes, that's you.  Yes. You didnt remember what you were wearing today, did you?    Question:  So I think we can agree that in our nation, we celebrate diversity.  Diversity of ethnicity is the basis, the background.  And I'm just wondering -- well, of course, U of Chicago is a diversity of ideas.  I'm just wondering what diverse characteristics Judge Garland would bring to the Supreme Court. President Obama:  Well, hes from Skokie -- which is very important.  It's a great place.  It's a great town.  The way I've thought about diversity is not to think about any single seat as, oh, I've got to fill this slot with this demographic, but rather if I've got a broad set of nominees to make -- and this is true across the board -- how do I make sure that I'm intentional throughout that process so that the talent of every American is, and every potential candidate gets a fair look, and I have confidence that if I stick to that, if I do that, if I make sure that I'm broadening the search, broadening the pool, looking at a bunch of folks even if theyre not going through the conventional paths, that I'll end up -- the process will result in diversity. And that, in fact, is whats happened.  I am -- not to brag, but I have transformed the federal courts from a diversity standpoint with a record that's been unmatched.    We've got more African Americans on the circuit courts than we ever has before.  We've got -- I've appointed more African American women to the federal courts than any other President before.  I've appointed more Latinos than any President before.  I've appointed more Native Americans, more Asian Americans, more LGBT judges than ever before.  But at no point did I say, oh, you know what, I need a black lesbian from Skokie -- in that slot.  Can you find me one?    I mean, that's just not how I've approached it.  It turns out that if the process is fair and you are saying that it's important that our courts are reflective of a changing society, youll end up with a really good cross-section of people who are excellent.  And that's who we've been able to appoint. And so, when I looked at Merrick Garland, that was the person that -- the difference between the Supreme Court is just a handful of seats come up at any given time now.  I appointed a Latino woman and another woman right before that, so, yeah, hes a white guy, but hes a really outstanding jurist.  Sorry.    I think that's important. But this speaks to the broader debate about diversity that I think is important and obviously churns up in college campuses a lot.  The question is, have you set up a process and are you intentional about giving everybody a shot?  And are you thinking about roadblocks to why we're not seeing a more diverse population?  And when you start asking those questions -- in whatever institution.  I mean, I just met with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commanders, our key military leaders.  And the U.S. military, interestingly, has probably done as good of a job as any institution in our society when it comes to integration and bringing diverse people in, but, as you go up the ranks, you start seeing that it becomes less and less reflective of the broader population and the troops, the men and women in uniform who are coming in. And so we had a really interesting conversation about whats happening?  How much of this is that the young African American or Latino officer, or woman officer isn't mentored by the person right above them, and steered into particular assignments that are less likely to achieve a promotion?  And what can we do about a different set of financial burdens that may exist?  And if a lot of those folks are going in as enlisted men and women, because that's the opportunity that was presented to them and  nobody told them they could apply to West Point, what are we doing to find outstanding enlisteds, and saying, youd make a good officer and we're going to groom you? And all of that -- that's not as satisfying as, when it comes to publicity, as just checking a box and saying, look, I appointed this person or that person in any particular slot.  But that's where you start changing systems, and you start changing institutions, and you end up with a really broad-based change in access.  And that's something that I really care deeply about because, just as is true in the military, it's true generally.  Look, our society is changing.  You cannot have a successful America if we are leaving out big chunks of the population from opportunity and leadership.  It just doesnt work. And it's the same argument I make internationally in countries that are still repressing women -- saying, your society cannot work, it doesnt work if more than half your population is constrained.  If the half of that population that is most likely to be raising your children and teaching the next generation is not getting opportunity, your society will fail over the long term.  And that's just true generally. All right, one last question.  Question:  What happens -- President Obama:  Excuse me, you were not called on.    And you are a journalist.  And I'm calling on students.  So, thank you very much.  This wasnt a press conference.  So, lets just see -- it's a gentlemans turn.  This gentleman right there.  Question:  Hi, my name is Seth.  I'm a 3L.  If you don't mind me reading my question -- President Obama:  It's okay.  This is what I was saying about you guys and your phones.    By the way, are you now  -- I'm assuming you can't carry your phones into court, can you? Question:  Actually, it depends.    President Obama:  I'm going to say, you guys might want to practice -- Question:  I'll try to work on that.    So one issue that Judge Garland would likely never be able to consider if he were confirmed concerns the Presidents authority to conduct drone strikes away from active battlefields.  And these are strikes that you have continuously authorized on the basis of vague legal standards that you unilaterally deem to be satisfied in each case without ever appearing before a court, and in the process killing hundreds of innocent civilians as well as, in some cases, American citizens.  So my question is, how are these killings morally and legally justified?  And what kind of message does this drone program send about Americas values to the world, the American people, and to law students like myself who refuse to put our trust in an opaque process? President Obama:  I think that's a great question -- although I will say that I will dispute some of the underlying premises that you asserted as facts.  But I think it's an important topic, and it's a fair one.  When I came into office, we were still in the midst of two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, al Qaida was still highly active.  And drone technologies began to develop in parallel with -- had developed prior to my presidency, but started to really accelerate in terms of the technology and the precision with which strikes could be taken.  And the challenge for me as Commander-in-Chief has consistently been how do you think about this new technology in a way that is consistent with morality, ideals, laws of war, but is also consistent with my first priority as President and Commander-in-Chief, which is to keep all of you safe, including you. And so I think its fair to say that in the first couple of years of my presidency, the architecture -- legal architecture, administrative architecture, command structures -- around how these were utilized was underdeveloped relative to how fast the technology was moving.  So another way of saying this is our military or our intelligence teams started seeing this as really effective.  And they started just going because the goal was lets get al Qaeda, lets get these leaders.  Theres a training camp here.  Theres a high-value target there.  Lets move.  And it was -- the decision-making was not ad hoc, but it was embedded in decisions that are made all the time about a commander leading a military operation, or an intelligence team trying to take out a terrorist.  And there wasnt enough of an overarching structure, right?", "filename": "07April2016ConversationattheUniversity.ofChicagoLawSchool.txt"}, {"question": "I want to make a few other acknowledgments. To Tom Bell, the Chamber Board President, thank you for helping to organize this. There are some members of my administration I want to make sure are introduced. My Chief of Staff, Bill Daley, is here. Senior advisor Valerie Jarrett, who is interfacing with many of you and has gotten terrific advice from many of you, is here as well. Secretary Ray LaHood, our Transportation Secretary. Ambassador Ron Kirk, who is working hard to get trade deals around the world. Our Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills. My director of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, is here. And I also want to make mention, Fred Hochberg, our Export-Import Bank Chairman; Elizabeth Littlefield, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation President. And I also want to acknowledge a good friend, Paul Volcker, the outgoing chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. Thank you all for being here. Now, Tom, it is good to be here today at the Chamber of Commerce. I'm here in the interest of being more neighborly. I strolled over from across the street, and look, maybe if we had brought over a fruitcake when I first moved in, we would have gotten off to a better start. But I'm going to make up for it. The truth is, this isn't the first time I've been to the Chamber, or the first time that we've exchanged ideas. Over the last two years, I've sought advice from many of you as we were grappling with the worst recession most of us have ever known. It's a recession that led to some very difficult decisions. For many of you, that meant restructuring and branch closings and layoffs that I know were very painful to make. For my administration, it meant a series of emergency measures that I would not have undertaken under normal circumstances, but that were necessary to stop our economy from falling off a cliff. Now, on some issues, like the Recovery Act, we've found common cause. On other issues, we've had some pretty strong disagreements. But I'm here today because I am convinced, as Tom mentioned in his introduction, that we can and we must work together. Whatever differences we may have, I know that all of us share a deep, abiding belief in this country, a belief in our people, a belief in the principles that have made America's economy the envy of the world. America's success didn't happen overnight, and it didn't happen by accident. It happened because [of] the freedom that has allowed good ideas to flourish, that has allowed capitalism to thrive; it happened because of the conviction that in this country hard work should be rewarded and that opportunity should be there for anybody who's willing to reach for it. And because it happened at every juncture in our history -- not just once, not just twice, but over and over again -- we came together to remake ourselves; we came together as one nation and did what was necessary to win the future. That is why I am so confident that we will win the future again. That's the challenge that we face today. We still have, by far, the world's largest and most vibrant economy. We have the most productive workers, the finest universities and the freest markets. The men and women in this room are living testimony that American industry is still the source of the most dynamic companies, and the most ingenious entrepreneurs. But we also know that with the march of technology over the last few decades, the competition for jobs and businesses has grown fierce. The globalization of our economy means that businesses can now open up a shop, employ workers and produce their goods wherever an Internet connection exists. Tasks that were once done by 1,000 workers can now be done by 100 or in some cases even 10. And the truth is, as countries like China and India and Brazil grow and develop larger middle classes, it's profitable for global companies to aggressively pursue these markets and, at times, to set up facilities in these countries. These forces are as unstoppable as they are powerful. But combined with a brutal and devastating recession, these forces have also shaken the faith of the American people -- in the institutions of business and government. They see a widening chasm of wealth and opportunity in this country, and they wonder if the American Dream is slipping away. They wonder if the middle class, rather than expanding as it has through our lifetimes, is in the midst of an inexorable contraction. And we can't ignore these concerns. We have to renew people's faith in the promise of this country -- that this is a place where you can make it if you try. And we have to do this together: business and government; workers and CEOs; Democrats and Republicans. We know what it will take for America to win the future. We need to out-innovate, we need to out-educate, we need to out-build our competitors. We need an economy that's based not on what we consume and borrow from other nations, but what we make and what we sell around the world. We need to make America the best place on Earth to do business. And this is a job for all of us. As a government, we will help lay the foundation for you to grow and innovate and succeed. We will upgrade our transportation and communication networks so you can move goods and information more quickly and more cheaply. We'll invest in education so that you can hire the most skilled, talented workers in the world. And we'll work to knock down barriers that make it harder for you to compete, from the tax code to the regulatory system. But I want to be clear: Even as we make America the best place on Earth to do business, businesses also have a responsibility to America. I understand the challenges you face. I understand you are under incredible pressure to cut costs and keep your margins up. I understand the significance of your obligations to your shareholders and the pressures that are created by quarterly reports. I get it. But as we work with you to make America a better place to do business, I'm hoping that all of you are thinking what you can do for America. Ask yourselves what you can do to hire more American workers, what you can do to support the American economy and invest in this nation. That's what I want to talk about today -- the responsibilities we all have -- the mutual responsibilities we have -- to secure the future that we all share. Now, as a country, we have a responsibility to encourage American innovation. I talked about this quite a bit at my State of the Union. Companies like yours have always driven the discovery of new products and new ideas. You do it better than anybody. But what you also know is that it's not always profitable to -- in the short-term, at least -- for you to invest in basic research. It's very expensive, and the payoffs are not always clear and they're not always localized. And that's why government has traditionally helped invest in this kind of science, planting the seeds that ultimately grew into technologies from the computer chips to the Internet. That's why we're making investments today in the next generation of big ideas -- in biotechnology, in information technology and in clean energy technology. We're reforming our patent system so innovations can move more quickly to market. Steve Case is heading up a new partnership called Startup America to help entrepreneurs turn new ideas into new businesses and new jobs. And I've also proposed a bigger, permanent tax credit for all the research and development your companies do in this country. I believe that is a priority. We also have a responsibility as a nation to provide our people with -- and our businesses -- with the fastest, most reliable way to move goods and information. The costs to business from outdated and inadequate infrastructure is enormous. And that's what we have right now -- outdated, inadequate infrastructure. And any of you that have been traveling to other countries, you know it, you see it, and it affects your bottom lines. That's why I want to put more people to work rebuilding crumbling roads, rebuilding our bridges. That's why I've proposed connecting 80 percent of the country with high-speed -- to high-speed rail, and making it possible for companies to put high-speed Internet coverage in the reach of virtually all Americans. You understand the importance of this. The fact is, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO don't agree on a whole lot. Tom Donohue and Richard Trumka are not Facebook friends. Well, maybe -- I don't think you are anyway. I didn't check on this, but -- but they agree on the need to build a 21st-century infrastructure. And I want to thank the Chamber for pushing Congress to make more infrastructure investments, and to do so in the most cost-effective way possible: with tax dollars that leverage private capital, and with projects that are determined not by politics, but by what's best for our economy. Third responsibility that we have as a nation is to invest in the skills and education of our young people. If we expect companies to do business and hire in America, America needs a pool of trained, talented workers that can out-compete anybody in the world. And that's why we're reforming K-12 education; that's why we're training 100,000 new math and science teachers; that's why we're making college more affordable, and revitalizing our community college system. Recently I visited GE in Schenectady, which has partnered with a local community college. And while students train for jobs available at the nearby GE plant, they earn a paycheck and they've got their tuition covered. And as a result, young people can find work, GE can fill high-skill positions, and the entire region has become more attractive to businesses. It's a win-win for everybody, and it's something we're trying to duplicate across the country. Now, to make room for these investments in education, in innovation, in infrastructure, government also has a responsibility to cut spending that we just can't afford. That's why I've promised to veto any bill that's larded up with earmarks. That's why I've proposed that we freeze annual domestic spending for the next five years. Understand what this means. This would reduce the deficit by more than $400 billion over the next decade, and bring this spending -- domestic discretionary spending -- down to the lowest share of our economy since Eisenhower was President. That was a long time ago. Now, it's not going to be enough. We're going to have to do more. Because the driving force on our deficits are entitlements spending. And that's going to require both parties to work together, because those are some tough problems that we're going to have to solve. And I am eager to work with both parties and with the Chamber to take additional steps across the budget to put our nation on a sounder fiscal footing. By stopping spending on things we don't need, we can make investments in the things that we do need, the same way families do. If they've got a fiscal problem, if they've got to tighten their belt, they don't stop paying for Johnny to go to college. They cut out things they don't need, but they still make investments in the thing that are going to make sure we win the future. And that's what we have to do as a country: make some smart choices -- tough choices, but smart ones. Now, in addition to making government more affordable, we're also making it more effective and more consumer-friendly. We're trying to run the government a little bit more like you run your business -- with better technology and faster services. So in the coming months, my administration will develop a proposal to merge, consolidate and reorganize the federal government in a way that best serves the goal of a more competitive America. And we want to start with the 12 different agencies that deal with America's exports. If we hope to help our businesses sell more goods around the world, we should ensure we're all pulling in the same direction. And frankly, with 12 different agencies in charge, nobody is in charge. So we're going to fix that as an example of how we can make a government that's more responsive to the American people and to American businesses. Which brings me to the final responsibility of government: breaking down some of the barriers that stand in the way of your success. As far as exports are concerned, that means seeking new opportunities and opening new markets for your goods. And I will tell you I will go anywhere anytime to be a booster for American businesses, American workers and American products. We recently signed -- and I don't charge a commission. We recently signed export deals with India and China that will support more than 250,000 jobs here in the United States. We finalized a trade agreement with South Korea that will support at least 70,000 American jobs. And by the way, it's a deal that has unprecedented support from business and labor, Democrats and Republicans. That's the kind of deal that I will be looking for as we pursue trade agreements with Panama and Colombia, as we work to bring Russia into the international trading system. Those are going to be our top priorities because we believe Americans have the best products and the best businesses, and if we're out there selling and we're out there hustling, there's no reason why we can't do a lot better than we're doing right now when it comes to our exports. Now, another barrier government can remove -- and I hear a lot about this from many of you -- is a burdensome corporate tax code with one of the highest rates in the world. You know how it goes: because of various loopholes and carve-outs that have built up over the years, some industries pay an average rate that is four or five times higher than others. Companies are taxed heavily for making investments with equity, yet the tax code actually pays companies to invest using leverage. As a result, you've got too many companies ending up making decisions based on what their tax director says instead of what their engineer designs or what their factories produce. And that puts our entire economy at a disadvantage. We need something smarter, something simpler, something fairer. That's why I want to lower the corporate rate and eliminate these loopholes to pay for it, so that it doesn't add a dime to our deficit. And I'm asking for your help in this fight. I think it can be done. Which brings me to the last barriers we're trying to remove, and those are outdated and unnecessary regulations. I've ordered a government-wide review, and if there are rules on the books that are needlessly stifling job creation and economic growth, we will fix them. Already we're dramatically cutting down on the paperwork that saddles businesses with huge administrative costs. We're improving the way FDA evaluates things like medical devices, to get innovative and lifesaving treatments to market faster. And the EPA, based on the need for further scientific analysis, delayed the greenhouse gas permitting rules for biomass. I've also ordered agencies to find ways to make regulations more flexible for small businesses. And we've turned a tangle of fuel economy regulations and pending lawsuits into a single standard that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, save consumers money at the pump and give car companies the certainty that they need -- all negotiated by the various stakeholders without the need for congressional legislation. But ultimately, winning the future is not just about what the government can do for you to succeed. It's also about what you can do to help America succeed. So we were just talking about regulations. Even as we eliminate burdensome regulations, America's businesses have a responsibility as well to recognize that there are some basic safeguards, some basic standards that are necessary to protect the American people from harm or exploitation. Not every regulation is bad. Not every regulation is burdensome on business. A lot of the regulations that are out there are things that all of us welcome in our lives. Few of us would want to live in a society without rules that keep our air and water clean; that give consumers the confidence to do everything from investing in financial markets to buying groceries. And the fact is, when standards like these have been proposed in the past, opponents have often warned that they would be an assault on business and free enterprise. We can look at the history in this country. Early drug companies argued the bill creating the FDA would \"practically destroy the sale of  remedies in the United States.\" That didn't happen. Auto executives predicted that having to install seatbelts would bring the downfall of their industry. It didn't happen. The President of the American Bar Association denounced child labor laws as \"a communistic effort to nationalize children.\" That's a quote. None of these things came to pass. In fact, companies adapt and standards often spark competition and innovation. I was travelling when I went up to Penn State to look at some clean energy hubs that have been set up. I was with Steve Chu, my Secretary of Energy. And he won a Nobel Prize in physics, so when you're in conversations with him you catch about one out of every four things he says. But he started talking about energy efficiency and about refrigerators, and he pointed out that the government set modest targets a couple decades ago to start increasing efficiency over time. They were well thought through; they weren't radical. Companies competed to hit these markers. And they hit them every time, and then exceeded them. And as a result, a typical fridge now costs half as much and uses a quarter of the energy that it once did -- and you don't have to defrost, chipping at that stuff --  and then putting the warm water inside the freezer and all that stuff. It saves families and businesses billions of dollars. So regulations didn't destroy the industry; it enhanced it and it made our lives better -- if they're smart, if they're well designed. And that's our goal, is to work with you to think through how do we design necessary regulations in a smart way and get rid of regulations that have outlived their usefulness, or don't work. I also have to point out the perils of too much regulation are also matched by the dangers of too little. And we saw that in the financial crisis, where the absence of sound rules of the road, that wasn't good for business. Even if you weren't in the financial sector it wasn't good for business. And that's why, with the help of Paul Volcker, who is here today, we passed a set of common-sense reforms. The same can be said of health insurance reform. We simply could not continue to accept a status quo that's made our entire economy less competitive, as we've paid more per person for health care than any other nation on Earth. Nobody is even close. And we couldn't accept a broken system where insurance companies could drop people because they got sick, or families went into bankruptcy because of medical bills. I know that folks here have concerns about this law. And I understand it. If you're running a business right now and you're seeing these escalating health care costs, your instinct is if I've got even more laws on top of me, that's going to increase my costs even more. I understand that suspicion, that skepticism. But the non-partisan congressional watchdogs at the CBO estimate that health care tax credits will be worth nearly $40 billion for small businesses over the next decade -- $40 billion, directly to small businesses who are doing the right thing by their employees. And experts -- not just from the government, but also those commissioned by the Business Roundtable -- suggest that health insurance reform could ultimately save large employers anywhere from $2,000 to $3,000 per family -- your employees and your bottom line. I've said in the State of the Union and I'll repeat here today: I am willing and happy to look at other ideas to improve the law, including incentives to improve patient safety and medical malpractice reforms. And I want to correct a flaw that's already placed an unnecessary bookkeeping burden on too many small businesses, and I appreciate the Chamber's help in doing that. But we have to recognize that some common-sense regulations often will make sense for your businesses, as well as your families, as well as your neighbors, as well as your coworkers. Of course, your responsibility goes beyond recognizing the need for certain standards and safeguards. If we're fighting to reform the tax code and increase exports to help you compete, the benefits can't just translate into greater profits and bonuses for those at the top. They have to be shared by American workers, who need to know that expanding trade and opening markets will lift their standards of living as well as your bottom line. We can't go back to the kind of economy and culture that we saw in the years leading up to the recession, where growth and gains in productivity just didn't translate into rising incomes and opportunity for the middle class. That's not something necessarily we can legislate, but it's something that all of us have to take responsibility for thinking about. How do we make sure that everybody's got a stake in trade, everybody's got a stake in increasing exports, everybody's got a stake in rising productivity?", "filename": "07February2011SpeechtotheUSChamberofCommerce.txt"}, {"question": "Well, good morning everybody.  This afternoon, I'm going to be in Southern California to meet with President Xi of China.  But before I leave Northern California, I wanted to take a minute to address something thats happening with the Affordable Care Act in this state, and I wanted to meet with a group of people who are doing some very important work on behalf of Californias middle-class families. These leaders from Californias government, the California Endowment, and major Spanish language media outlets have joined together to help implement the Affordable Care Act here in California and to educate folks about how to sign up and shop for quality, affordable plans.  And their efforts have already shown some excellent results in the biggest insurance market in the country. There are two main things that Americans need to know when it comes to the Affordable Care Act and what it means for you. First of all, if youre one of the nearly 85 percent of Americans who already have insurance, either through Medicare or Medicaid or your employer, you dont have to do a thing.  Youve just got a wide array of new benefits, better protections and stronger cost controls that you didnt have before, and that will, over time, improve the quality of the insurance that you've got; benefits like free preventive care -- checkups, flu shots, mammograms and contraception.  You are now going to be able to get those things through your insurance where they previously were not -- didnt have to be provided.  Protections like allowing people up to the age of 26 to stay on their parent's health care plans, which has already helped 6 million Americans, including [1 million] young Latino Americans.    Cost controls like requiring insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of the money that you pay in premiums in your actual health care costs, as opposed to administrative costs or CEO pay -- not overhead, but that money has to be spent on you.  And if they dont meet that target, they actually have to reimburse you.  So in California, were already getting reports that insurers are giving rebates to consumers and small business owners to the tune of $45 million this year.  So already we're seeing millions of dollars of rebates sent back to consumers by insurance companies as a consequence of this law. All of that is happening because of the Affordable Care Act.  All of this is in place right now, already, for 85 percent of Americans who have health insurance.  By the way, all of this is what the Republican Party has now voted 37 times to repeal, at least in the House of Representatives.  And my suggestion to them has been, let's stop refighting the old battles and start working with people like the leaders who are on stage here today to make this law work the way its supposed to. Were focused on moving forward and making sure that this law works for middle-class families.  And that brings me to the second thing that people need to know about the Affordable Care Act.  If youre one of nearly 6 million Californians or tens of millions of Americans who dont currently have health insurance, youll soon be able to buy quality, affordable care just like everybody else.  And heres how.  States like California are setting up new, online marketplaces where, beginning on October 1st of this year, you can comparison shop an array of private health insurance plans side-by-side, just like you were going online to compare cars or airline tickets.  And that means insurance companies will actually have to compete with each other for your business.  And that means new choices. See, right now, most states dont have a lot of competition.  In nearly every state, more than half of all consumers are covered by only two insurers.  So theres no incentive to provide you a lot of choices or to keep costs down.  The Affordable Care Act changes that.  Beginning next year, once these marketplaces are open, most states will offer new private insurance choices that dont exist today.  And based on early reports, about 9 in 10 Americans expected to enroll in these marketplaces live in states where theyll be able to choose between five or more different insurers.  So for example, here in California, 33 insurers applied to join the marketplace.  Covered California then selected 13 based on access, quality, and affordability, four of which are brand new to your individual market. So whats happening is through the Affordable Care Act, were creating these marketplaces with more competition, more choice, and so the question is, what happens to cost? Now, a lot of the opponents of the Affordable Care Act, they had all kinds of sky-is-falling, doom-and-gloom predictions that not only would the law fail, but what wed also is costs would skyrocket for everybody.  Well, it turns out were actually seeing that in the states that have committed themselves to implementing this law correctly, were seeing some good news.  Competition and choice are pushing down costs in the individual market just like the law was designed to do. The 13 insurance companies that were chosen by Covered California have unveiled premiums that were lower than anybody expected.  And those who cant afford to buy private insurance will get help reducing their out-of-pocket premiums even further with the largest health care tax cut for working families and small businesses in our history.  So about 2.6 million Californians -- nearly half of whom are Latinos -- will qualify for tax credits that will, in some cases, lower their premiums a significant amount. Now, none of this is a surprise.  This is the way that the law was designed to work.  But since everybody has been saying how it's not going to happen, I think it's important for us to recognize and acknowledge this is working the way it's supposed to.  We've seen similar good news, by the way, not just here in California but in Oregon and Washington.  In states that are working hard to implement this law properly, we're seeing it work for people -- for middle-class families, for consumers. Now, that's not to say that everything is going to go perfectly right away.  When you're implementing a program this large, there will be some glitches.  There are going to be some hiccups.  But no matter what, every single consumer will be covered by the new benefits and protections under this law permanently.  So the bottom line is you can listen to a bunch of political talk out there -- negative ads and fear mongering geared towards the next election -- or alternatively you can actually look at whats happening in states like California right now.  And the fact of the matter is through these exchanges, not only are the 85 percent of people who already have health insurance getting better protections, and receiving rebates, and being able to keep their kids on their health insurance until they're 26, and getting free preventive care, but if you don't have health insurance and you're trying to get it through the individual market and it's too expensive or it's too restricted, you now have these marketplaces where they're going to offer you a better deal because of choice and competition. And if even at those lower rates and better insurance that you're getting through these marketplaces you still can't afford it, you're going to be getting tax cuts and tax credits through the Affordable Care Act that will help you afford it.  And that's how we're going to make sure that millions of people who don't currently have health insurance or are getting a really bad deal on their health insurance are finally going to get it.   But -- and here's my final point -- to take advantage of these marketplaces, folks are going to need to sign up.  So you can find out how to sign up at HealthCare.gov, or here in California you can sign up at CoveredCA.com.  Because quality care is not something that should be a privilege, it should be a right.  In the greatest country on Earth, we've got to make sure that every single person that needs health care can get it.  And we've got to make sure that we do it in the most efficient way possible.  One last point I'm going to make on this, because there are a lot of people who currently get health insurance through their employers -- the 85 percent who are already out there -- and they may be saying, well, if this law is so great, why is it that my premium still went up?  Well, part of what's happening across the country is in some cases, for example, employers may be shifting more costs through higher premiums or higher deductibles or higher copays, and so there may still be folks who are out there feeling increased costs not because of the Affordable Care Act but because those costs are being passed on to workers or insurance companies, in some cases.  Even with these laws in place, they're still jacking up prices unnecessarily. So this doesn't solve the whole problem, but it moves us in the right direction.  Its also the reason why we have to keep on implementing changes in how our health care system works to continually drive better efficiency, higher quality, lower cost.  Were starting to do that.  Health care cost inflation has gone up at the lowest rate over the last three years that weve seen in many, many years.  So were making progress in actually reducing overall health care costs while improving quality, but were going to have to continue to push on that front as well.  That's also part of what were doing in the Affordable Care Act. But the main message I want for Californians and people all across the country -- starting on October 1st, if youre in the individual market, you can get a better deal.  If youre a small business that's providing health insurance to your employees, you can get a better deal through these exchanges.  Youve got to sign up:  HealthCare.gov, or here in California at CoveredCA.com.  All right?  So thank you very much. Question: Mr. President? President Obama:  Im going to take one question.  And then, remember, people are going to have opportunities to also -- answer questions when Im with the Chinese President today.  So I don't want the whole day to just be a bleeding press conference.  But Im going to take Jackie Calmes question. Question: Mr. President, could you please react to the reports of secret government surveillance of phones and Internet?  And can you also assure Americans that the government -- your government doesn't have some massive secret database of all their personal online information and activities? President Obama: Yes.  When I came into this office, I made two commitments that are more important than any commitment I made:  Number one, to keep the American people safe; and number two, to uphold the Constitution.  And that includes what I consider to be a constitutional right to privacy and an observance of civil liberties. Now, the programs that have been discussed over the last couple days in the press are secret in the sense that they're classified.  But they're not secret in the sense that when it comes to telephone calls, every member of Congress has been briefed on this program.  With respect to all these programs, the relevant intelligence committees are fully briefed on these programs.  These are programs that have been authorized by broad bipartisan majorities repeatedly since 2006.  And so, I think at the outset, it's important to understand that your duly elected representatives have been consistently informed on exactly what we're doing.  Now, let me take the two issues separately.  When it comes to telephone calls, nobody is listening to your telephone calls.  Thats not what this program is about.  As was indicated, what the intelligence community is doing is looking at phone numbers and durations of calls.  They are not looking at people's names, and they're not looking at content.  But by sifting through this so-called metadata, they may identify potential leads with respect to folks who might engage in terrorism.  If these folks -- if the intelligence community then actually wants to listen to a phone call, they've got to go back to a federal judge, just like they would in a criminal investigation.  So I want to be very clear -- some of the hype that we've been hearing over the last day or so -- nobody is listening to the content of people's phone calls.  This program, by the way, is fully overseen not just by Congress, but by the FISA Court -- a court specially put together to evaluate classified programs to make sure that the executive branch, or government generally, is not abusing them, and that it's being carried out consistent with the Constitution and rule of law. And so, not only does that court authorize the initial gathering of data, but -- I want to repeat -- if anybody in government wanted to go further than just that top-line data and want to, for example, listen to Jackie Calmes' phone call, they would have to go back to a federal judge and indicate why, in fact, they were doing further probing.  Now, with respect to the Internet and emails -- this does not apply to U.S. citizens and it does not apply to people living in the United States.  And again, in this instance, not only is Congress fully apprised of it, but what is also true is that the FISA Court has to authorize it.  So in summary, what you've got is two programs that were originally authorized by Congress, have been repeatedly authorized by Congress, bipartisan majorities have approved on them, Congress is continually briefed on how these are conducted.  There are a whole range of safeguards involved, and federal judges are overseeing the entire program throughout.  We're also setting up -- We've also set up an audit process, when I came into office, to make sure that we're, after the fact, making absolutely certain that all the safeguards are being properly observed.  Now, having said all that, you'll remember when I made that speech a couple of weeks ago about the need for us to shift out of a perpetual war mindset, I specifically said that one of the things that we're going to have to discuss and debate is how are we striking this balance between the need to keep the American people safe and our concerns about privacy?  Because there are some tradeoffs involved.  I welcome this debate.  And I think it's healthy for our democracy.  I think it's a sign of maturity, because probably five years ago, six years ago, we might not have been having this debate.  And I think it's interesting that there are some folks on the left but also some folks on the right who are now worried about it who weren't very worried about it when there was a Republican President.  I think that's good that we're having this discussion. But I think it's important for everybody to understand -- and I think the American people understand -- that there are some tradeoffs involved.  I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs.  My team evaluated them.  We scrubbed them thoroughly.  We actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of safeguards.  But my assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks.  And the modest encroachments on the privacy that are involved in getting phone numbers or duration without a name attached and not looking at content, that on net, it was worth us doing.  Some other folks may have a different assessment on that. But I think it's important to recognize that you can't have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience.  We're going to have to make some choices as a society.  And what I can say is that in evaluating these programs, they make a difference in our capacity to anticipate and prevent possible terrorist activity.  And the fact that theyre under very strict supervision by all three branches of government and that they do not involve listening to people's phone calls, do not involve reading the emails of U.S. citizens or U.S. residents absent further action by a federal court that is entirely consistent with what we would do, for example, in a criminal investigation -- I think on balance, we have established a process and a procedure that the American people should feel comfortable about.  But, again, these programs are subject to congressional oversight and congressional reauthorization and congressional debate.  And if there are members of Congress who feel differently, then they should speak up.  And we're happy to have that debate.  Okay?  All right.  And we'll have a chance to talk further over the course of the next couple of days. Question: Do you welcome the leaks, sir?  Do you welcome the leaks?  Do you welcome the debate?", "filename": "07June2013OnAffordableCareActandGovernmentDomesticSurveillance.txt"}, {"question": "President and Mrs. Bush, Governor Bentley, Mayor Evans, Sewell, Reverend Strong, members of Congress, elected officials, foot soldiers, friends, fellow Americans: As John noted, there are places and moments in America where this nations destiny has been decided.  Many are sites of war -- Concord and Lexington, Appomattox, Gettysburg.  Others are sites that symbolize the daring of Americas character -- Independence Hall and Seneca Falls, Kitty Hawk and Cape Canaveral. Selma is such a place.  In one afternoon 50 years ago, so much of our turbulent history -- the stain of slavery and anguish of civil war; the yoke of segregation and tyranny of Jim Crow; the death of four little girls in Birmingham; and the dream of a Baptist preacher -- all that history met on this bridge.2 It was not a clash of armies, but a clash of wills; a contest to determine the true meaning of America.  And because of men and women like John Lewis, Joseph Lowery, Hosea Williams, Amelia Boynton, Diane Nash, Ralph Abernathy, C.T. Vivian, Andrew Young, Fred Shuttlesworth, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and so many others, the idea of a just America and a fair America, an inclusive America, and a generous America -- that idea ultimately triumphed. As is true across the landscape of American history, we cannot examine this moment in isolation.  The march on Selma was part of a broader campaign that spanned generations; the leaders that day part of a long line of heroes. We gather here to celebrate them.  We gather here to honor the courage of ordinary Americans willing to endure billy clubs and the chastening rod; tear gas and the trampling hoof; men and women who despite the gush of blood and splintered bone would stay true to their North Star and keep marching towards justice. They did as Scripture instructed:  Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.  And in the days to come, they went back again and again.  When the trumpet call sounded for more to join, the people came -- black and white, young and old, Christian and Jew, waving the American flag and singing the same anthems full of faith and hope.  A white newsman, Bill Plante, who covered the marches then and who is with us here today, quipped that the growing number of white people lowered the quality of the singing.  To those who marched, though, those old gospel songs must have never sounded so sweet. In time, their chorus would well up and reach President Johnson.  And he would send them protection, and speak to the nation, echoing their call for America and the world to hear:  We shall overcome.  What enormous faith these men and women had.  Faith in God, but also faith in America.  The Americans who crossed this bridge, they were not physically imposing.  But they gave courage to millions.  They held no elected office.  But they led a nation.  They marched as Americans who had endured hundreds of years of brutal violence, countless daily indignities -- but they didnt seek special treatment, just the equal treatment promised to them almost a century before. What they did here will reverberate through the ages.  Not because the change they won was preordained; not because their victory was complete; but because they proved that nonviolent change is possible, that love and hope can conquer hate. As we commemorate their achievement, we are well-served to remember that at the time of the marches, many in power condemned rather than praised them.  Back then, they were called Communists, or half-breeds, or outside agitators, sexual and moral degenerates, and worse -- they were called everything but the name their parents gave them.  Their faith was questioned; their lives were threatened; their patriotism challenged. And yet, what could be more American than what happened in this place?  What could more profoundly vindicate the idea of America than plain and humble people -- unsung, the downtrodden, the dreamers not of high station, not born to wealth or privilege, not of one religious tradition but many, coming together to shape their countrys course?  What greater expression of faith in the American experiment than this, what greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical, that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals? Thats why Selma is not some outlier in the American experience.  Thats why its not a museum or a static monument to behold from a distance.  It is instead the manifestation of a creed written into our founding documents:  We the Peoplein order to form a more perfect union.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. These are not just words.  Theyre a living thing, a call to action, a roadmap for citizenship and an insistence in the capacity of free men and women to shape our own destiny.  For founders like Franklin and Jefferson, for leaders like Lincoln and FDR, the success of our experiment in self-government rested on engaging all of our citizens in this work.  And thats what we celebrate here in Selma.  Thats what this movement was all about, one leg in our long journey toward freedom. The American instinct that led these young men and women to pick up the torch and cross this bridge, thats the same instinct that moved patriots to choose revolution over tyranny.  Its the same instinct that drew immigrants from across oceans and the Rio Grande; the same instinct that led women to reach for the ballot, workers to organize against an unjust status quo; the same instinct that led us to plant a flag at Iwo Jima and on the surface of the Moon. Its the idea held by generations of citizens who believed that America is a constant work in progress; who believed that loving this country requires more than singing its praises or avoiding uncomfortable truths.  It requires the occasional disruption, the willingness to speak out for what is right, to shake up the status quo.  Thats America. Thats what makes us unique.  Thats what cements our reputation as a beacon of opportunity.  Young people behind the Iron Curtain would see Selma and eventually tear down that wall.  Young people in Soweto would hear Bobby Kennedy talk about ripples of hope and eventually banish the scourge of apartheid.  Young people in Burma went to prison rather than submit to military rule.  They saw what John Lewis had done.  From the streets of Tunis to the Maidan in Ukraine, this generation of young people can draw strength from this place, where the powerless could change the worlds greatest power and push their leaders to expand the boundaries of freedom.  They saw that idea made real right here in Selma, Alabama.  They saw that idea manifest itself here in America. Because of campaigns like this, a Voting Rights Act was passed.  Political and economic and social barriers came down.  And the change these men and women wrought is visible here today in the presence of African Americans who run boardrooms, who sit on the bench, who serve in elected office from small towns to big cities; from the Congressional Black Caucus all the way to the Oval Office. Because of what they did, the doors of opportunity swung open not just for black folks, but for every American.  Women marched through those doors.  Latinos marched through those doors.  Asian Americans, gay Americans, Americans with disabilities -- they all came through those doors.  Their endeavors gave the entire South the chance to rise again, not by reasserting the past, but by transcending the past.  What a glorious thing, Dr. King might say.  And what a solemn debt we owe.  Which leads us to ask, just how might we repay that debt? First and foremost, we have to recognize that one days commemoration, no matter how special, is not enough.  If Selma taught us anything, its that our work is never done.  The American experiment in self-government gives work and purpose to each generation. Selma teaches us, as well, that action requires that we shed our cynicism.  For when it comes to the pursuit of justice, we can afford neither complacency nor despair. Just this week, I was asked whether I thought the Department of Justices Ferguson report3 shows that, with respect to race, little has changed in this country.  And I understood the question; the reports narrative was sadly familiar.  It evoked the kind of abuse and disregard for citizens that spawned the Civil Rights Movement.  But I rejected the notion that nothings changed.  What happened in Ferguson may not be unique, but its no longer endemic.  Its no longer sanctioned by law or by custom.  And before the Civil Rights Movement, it most surely was. We do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, that racial division is inherent to America.  If you think nothings changed in the past 50 years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or Los Angeles of the 1950s.  Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothings changed.  Ask your gay friend if its easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago.  To deny this progress, this hard-won progress -- our progress -- would be to rob us of our own agency, our own capacity, our responsibility to do what we can to make America better.  Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest that Ferguson is an isolated incident; that racism is banished; that the work that drew men and women to Selma is now complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the race card for their own purposes.  We dont need the Ferguson report to know thats not true.  We just need to open our eyes, and our ears, and our hearts to know that this nations racial history still casts its long shadow upon us.  We know the march is not yet over.  We know the race is not yet won.  We know that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged, all of us, by the content of our character requires admitting as much, facing up to the truth.  We are capable of bearing a great burden, James Baldwin once wrote, once we discover that the burden is reality and arrive where reality is.  Theres nothing America cant handle if we actually look squarely at the problem.  And this is work for all Americans, not just some.  Not just whites.  Not just blacks.  If we want to honor the courage of those who marched that day, then all of us are called to possess their moral imagination.  All of us will need to feel as they did the fierce urgency of now.  All of us need to recognize as they did that change depends on our actions, on our attitudes, the things we teach our children.  And if we make such an effort, no matter how hard it may sometimes seem, laws can be passed, and consciences can be stirred, and consensus can be built. With such an effort, we can make sure our criminal justice system serves all and not just some.  Together, we can raise the level of mutual trust that policing is built on -- the idea that police officers are members of the community they risk their lives to protect, and citizens in Ferguson and New York and Cleveland, they just want the same thing young people here marched for 50 years ago - the protection of the law.  Together, we can address unfair sentencing and overcrowded prisons, and the stunted circumstances that rob too many boys of the chance to become men, and rob the nation of too many men who could be good dads, and good workers, and good neighbors. With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity.  Americans dont accept a free ride for anybody, nor do we believe in equality of outcomes.  But we do expect equal opportunity.  And if we really mean it, if were not just giving lip service to it, but if we really mean it and are willing to sacrifice for it, then, yes, we can make sure every child gets an education suitable to this new century, one that expands imaginations and lifts sights and gives those children the skills they need.  We can make sure every person willing to work has the dignity of a job, and a fair wage, and a real voice, and sturdier rungs on that ladder into the middle class. And with effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote.  Right now, in 2015, 50 years after Selma, there are laws across this country designed to make it harder for people to vote.  As we speak, more of such laws are being proposed.  Meanwhile, the Voting Rights Act, the culmination of so much blood, so much sweat and tears, the product of so much sacrifice in the face of wanton violence, the Voting Rights Act stands weakened, its future subject to political rancor. How can that be?  The Voting Rights Act was one of the crowning achievements of our democracy, the result of Republican and Democratic efforts. President Reagan signed its renewal when he was in office.  President George W. Bush signed its renewal when he was in office. One hundred members of Congress have come here today to honor people who were willing to die for the right to protect it.  If we want to honor this day, let that hundred go back to Washington and gather four hundred more, and together, pledge to make it their mission to restore that law this year.  Thats how we honor those on this bridge. Of course, our democracy is not the task of Congress alone, or the courts alone, or even the President alone.  If every new voter-suppression law was struck down today, we would still have, here in America, one of the lowest voting rates among free peoples.  Fifty years ago, registering to vote here in Selma and much of the South meant guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, the number of bubbles on a bar of soap.  It meant risking your dignity, and sometimes, your life.  Whats our excuse today for not voting?  How do we so casually discard the right for which so many fought?  How do we so fully give away our power, our voice, in shaping Americas future?  Why are we pointing to somebody else when we could take the time just to go to the polling places?", "filename": "07March2015SelmaMarch50-YearAnniversaryAddress.txt"}, {"question": "To the parents, the grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, all the family and friends who stood by this class, cheered them on, helped them get here today -- this is your day, as well.  Lets give them a big round of applause, as well.      Im not trying to stir up any rivalries here; I just want to see whos in the house.  We got Quad?   Annex.  Drew.  Carver.  Slow.  Towers.  And Meridian.   Rest in peace, Meridian.  Rest in peace.  I know youre all excited today.  You might be a little tired, as well.  Some of you were up all night making sure your credits were in order.    Some of you stayed up too late, ended up at HoChi at 2:00 a.m.   Got some mambo sauce on your fingers.    But you got here.  And you've all worked hard to reach this day.  Youve shuttled between challenging classes and Greek life.  You've led clubs, played an instrument or a sport.  You volunteered, you interned.  You held down one, two, maybe three jobs.  You've made lifelong friends and discovered exactly what youre made of.  The Howard Hustle has strengthened your sense of purpose and ambition.  Which means you're part of a long line of Howard graduates.  Some are on this stage today.  Some are in the audience.  That spirit of achievement and special responsibility has defined this campus ever since the Freedmans Bureau established Howard just four years after the Emancipation Proclamation; just two years after the Civil War came to an end.  They created this university with a vision -- a vision of uplift; a vision for an America where our fates would be determined not by our race, gender, religion or creed, but where we would be free -- in every sense -- to pursue our individual and collective dreams. It is that spirit that's made Howard a centerpiece of African-American intellectual life and a central part of our larger American story.  This institution has been the home of many firsts:  The first black Nobel Peace Prize winner.  The first black Supreme Court justice.  But its mission has been to ensure those firsts were not the last.  Countless scholars, professionals, artists, and leaders from every field received their training here.  The generations of men and women who walked through this yard helped reform our government, cure disease, grow a black middle class, advance civil rights, shape our culture.  The seeds of change -- for all Americans -- were sown here.  And thats what I want to talk about today. As I was preparing these remarks, I realized that when I was first elected President, most of you -- the Class of 2016 -- were just starting high school.  Today, youre graduating college.  I used to joke about being old.  Now I realize I'm old.    It's not a joke anymore.    But seeing all of you here gives me some perspective.  It makes me reflect on the changes that Ive seen over my own lifetime.  So let me begin with what may sound like a controversial statement -- a hot take. Given the current state of our political rhetoric and debate, let me say something that may be controversial, and that is this:  America is a better place today than it was when I graduated from college.    Let me repeat:  America is by almost every measure better than it was when I graduated from college.  It also happens to be better off than when I took office -- but that's a longer story.    That's a different discussion for another speech.  But think about it.  I graduated in 1983.  New York City, Americas largest city, where I lived at the time, had endured a decade marked by crime and deterioration and near bankruptcy.  And many cities were in similar shape.  Our nation had gone through years of economic stagnation, the stranglehold of foreign oil, a recession where unemployment nearly scraped 11 percent.  The auto industry was getting its clock cleaned by foreign competition.  And dont even get me started on the clothes and the hairstyles.  I've tried to eliminate all photos of me from this period.  I thought I looked good.    I was wrong.  Since that year -- since the year I graduated -- the poverty rate is down.  Americans with college degrees, that rate is up.  Crime rates are down.  Americas cities have undergone a renaissance.  There are more women in the workforce.  Theyre earning more money.  Weve cut teen pregnancy in half.  We've slashed the African American dropout rate by almost 60 percent, and all of you have a computer in your pocket that gives you the world at the touch of a button.  In 1983, I was part of fewer than 10 percent of African Americans who graduated with a bachelors degree.  Today, youre part of the more than 20 percent who will.  And more than half of blacks say were better off than our parents were at our age -- and that our kids will be better off, too. So America is better.  And the world is better, too.  A wall came down in Berlin.  An Iron Curtain was torn asunder.  The obscenity of apartheid came to an end.  A young generation in Belfast and London have grown up without ever having to think about IRA bombings.  In just the past 16 years, weve come from a world without marriage equality to one where its a reality in nearly two dozen countries.  Around the world, more people live in democracies.  Weve lifted more than 1 billion people from extreme poverty.  Weve cut the child mortality rate worldwide by more than half.  America is better.  The world is better.  And stay with me now -- race relations are better since I graduated.  Thats the truth.  No, my election did not create a post-racial society.  I dont know who was propagating that notion.  That was not mine.    But the election itself -- and the subsequent one -- because the first one, folks might have made a mistake.    The second one, they knew what they were getting.  The election itself was just one indicator of how attitudes had changed.  In my inaugural address, I remarked that just 60 years earlier, my father might not have been served in a D.C. restaurant -- at least not certain of them.  There were no black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.  Very few black judges.  Shoot, as Larry Wilmore pointed out last week, a lot of folks didnt even think blacks had the tools to be a quarterback.  Today, former Bull Michael Jordan isnt just the greatest basketball player of all time -- he owns the team.    When I was graduating, the main black hero on TV was Mr. T.    Rap and hip hop were counterculture, underground.  Now, Shonda Rhimes owns Thursday night, and Beyonc runs the world.    Were no longer only entertainers, we're producers, studio executives.  No longer small business owners -- we're CEOs, were mayors, representatives, Presidents of the United States.    I am not saying gaps do not persist.  Obviously, they do.  Racism persists.  Inequality persists.  Dont worry -- Im going to get to that.  But I wanted to start, Class of 2016, by opening your eyes to the moment that you are in.  If you had to choose one moment in history in which you could be born, and you didnt know ahead of time who you were going to be -- what nationality, what gender, what race, whether youd be rich or poor, gay or straight, what faith you'd be born into -- you wouldnt choose 100 years ago.  You wouldnt choose the fifties, or the sixties, or the seventies.  Youd choose right now.  If you had to choose a time to be, in the words of Lorraine Hansberry, young, gifted, and black in America, you would choose right now.    I tell you all this because it's important to note progress.  Because to deny how far weve come would do a disservice to the cause of justice, to the legions of foot soldiers; to not only the incredibly accomplished individuals who have already been mentioned, but your mothers and your dads, and grandparents and great grandparents, who marched and toiled and suffered and overcame to make this day possible.  I tell you this not to lull you into complacency, but to spur you into action -- because theres still so much more work to do, so many more miles to travel.  And America needs you to gladly, happily take up that work.  You all have some work to do.  So enjoy the party, because you're going to be busy.    Yes, our economy has recovered from crisis stronger than almost any other in the world.  But there are folks of all races who are still hurting -- who still cant find work that pays enough to keep the lights on, who still cant save for retirement.  Weve still got a big racial gap in economic opportunity.  The overall unemployment rate is 5 percent, but the black unemployment rate is almost nine.  Weve still got an achievement gap when black boys and girls graduate high school and college at lower rates than white boys and white girls.  Harriet Tubman may be going on the twenty, but weve still got a gender gap when a black woman working full-time still earns just 66 percent of what a white man gets paid.    Weve got a justice gap when too many black boys and girls pass through a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails.  This is one area where things have gotten worse.  When I was in college, about half a million people in America were behind bars.  Today, there are about 2.2 million.  Black men are about six times likelier to be in prison right now than white men.  Around the world, weve still got challenges to solve that threaten everybody in the 21st century -- old scourges like disease and conflict, but also new challenges, from terrorism and climate change.  So make no mistake, Class of 2016 -- youve got plenty of work to do.  But as complicated and sometimes intractable as these challenges may seem, the truth is that your generation is better positioned than any before you to meet those challenges, to flip the script.  Now, how you do that, how you meet these challenges, how you bring about change will ultimately be up to you.  My generation, like all generations, is too confined by our own experience, too invested in our own biases, too stuck in our ways to provide much of the new thinking that will be required.  But us old-heads have learned a few things that might be useful in your journey.  So with the rest of my time, Id like to offer some suggestions for how young leaders like you can fulfill your destiny and shape our collective future -- bend it in the direction of justice and equality and freedom. First of all -- and this should not be a problem for this group -- be confident in your heritage.    Be confident in your blackness.  One of the great changes thats occurred in our country since I was your age is the realization there's no one way to be black.  Take it from somebody whos seen both sides of debate about whether I'm black enough.    In the past couple months, Ive had lunch with the Queen of England and hosted Kendrick Lamar in the Oval Office.  Theres no straitjacket, there's no constraints, there's no litmus test for authenticity.  Look at Howard.  One thing most folks dont know about Howard is how diverse it is.  When you arrived here, some of you were like, oh, they've got black people in Iowa?    But its true -- this class comes from big cities and rural communities, and some of you crossed oceans to study here.  You shatter stereotypes.  Some of you come from a long line of Bison.  Some of you are the first in your family to graduate from college.    You all talk different, you all dress different.  Youre Lakers fans, Celtics fans, maybe even some hockey fans.    And because of those who've come before you, you have models to follow.  You can work for a company, or start your own.  You can go into politics, or run an organization that holds politicians accountable.  You can write a book that wins the National Book Award, or you can write the new run of Black Panther.  Or, like one of your alumni, Ta-Nehisi Coates, you can go ahead and just do both.  You can create your own style, set your own standard of beauty, embrace your own sexuality.  Think about an icon we just lost -- Prince.  He blew up categories.  People didnt know what Prince was doing.    And folks loved him for it.  You need to have the same confidence.  Or as my daughters tell me all the time, You be you, Daddy.    Sometimes Sasha puts a variation on it -- \"You do you, Daddy.\"    And because youre a black person doing whatever it is that you're doing, that makes it a black thing.  Feel confident. Second, even as we each embrace our own beautiful, unique, and valid versions of our blackness, remember the tie that does bind us as African Americans -- and that is our particular awareness of injustice and unfairness and struggle.  That means we cannot sleepwalk through life.  We cannot be ignorant of history.    We cant meet the world with a sense of entitlement.  We cant walk by a homeless man without asking why a society as wealthy as ours allows that state of affairs to occur.   We cant just lock up a low-level dealer without asking why this boy, barely out of childhood, felt he had no other options.  We have cousins and uncles and brothers and sisters who we remember were just as smart and just as talented as we were, but somehow got ground down by structures that are unfair and unjust.  And that means we have to not only question the world as it is, and stand up for those African Americans who havent been so lucky -- because, yes, you've worked hard, but you've also been lucky.  That's a pet peeve of mine:  People who have been successful and dont realize they've been lucky.  That God may have blessed them; it wasnt nothing you did.  So dont have an attitude.  But we must expand our moral imaginations to understand and empathize with all people who are struggling, not just black folks who are struggling -- the refugee, the immigrant, the rural poor, the transgender person, and yes, the middle-aged white guy who you may think has all the advantages, but over the last several decades has seen his world upended by economic and cultural and technological change, and feels powerless to stop it.  You got to get in his head, too. Number three:  You have to go through life with more than just passion for change; you need a strategy.  I'll repeat that.  I want you to have passion, but you have to have a strategy.  Not just awareness, but action.  Not just hashtags, but votes. You see, change requires more than righteous anger.  It requires a program, and it requires organizing.  At the 1964 Democratic Convention, Fannie Lou Hamer -- all five-feet-four-inches tall -- gave a fiery speech on the national stage.  But then she went back home to Mississippi and organized cotton pickers.  And she didn't have the tools and technology where you can whip up a movement in minutes.  She had to go door to door.  And Im so proud of the new guard of black civil rights leaders who understand this.  Its thanks in large part to the activism of young people like many of you, from Black Twitter to Black Lives Matter, that Americas eyes have been opened -- white, black, Democrat, Republican -- to the real problems, for example, in our criminal justice system. But to bring about structural change, lasting change, awareness is not enough.  It requires changes in law, changes in custom.  If you care about mass incarceration, let me ask you:  How are you pressuring members of Congress to pass the criminal justice reform bill now pending before them?    If you care about better policing, do you know who your district attorney is?  Do you know who your states attorney general is?  Do you know the difference?  Do you know who appoints the police chief and who writes the police training manual?  Find out who they are, what their responsibilities are.  Mobilize the community, present them with a plan, work with them to bring about change, hold them accountable if they do not deliver.  Passion is vital, but you've got to have a strategy. And your plan better include voting -- not just some of the time, but all the time.    It is absolutely true that 50 years after the Voting Rights Act, there are still too many barriers in this country to vote.  There are too many people trying to erect new barriers to voting.  This is the only advanced democracy on Earth that goes out of its way to make it difficult for people to vote.  And there's a reason for that.  There's a legacy to that.    But let me say this:  Even if we dismantled every barrier to voting, that alone would not change the fact that America has some of the lowest voting rates in the free world.  In 2014, only 36 percent of Americans turned out to vote in the midterms -- the secondlowest participation rate on record.  Youth turnout -- that would be you -- was less than 20 percent.  Less than 20 percent.  Four out of five did not vote.  In 2012, nearly two in three African Americans turned out.  And then, in 2014, only two in five turned out.  You dont think that made a difference in terms of the Congress I've got to deal with?  And then people are wondering, well, how come Obama hasnt gotten this done?  How come he didnt get that done?  You dont think that made a difference?  What would have happened if you had turned out at 50, 60, 70 percent, all across this country?  People try to make this political thing really complicated.  Like, what kind of reforms do we need?  And how do we need to do that?  You know what, just vote.  It's math.  If you have more votes than the other guy, you get to do what you want.    It's not that complicated.  And you dont have excuses.   You dont have to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar or bubbles on a bar of soap to register to vote.  You dont have to risk your life to cast a ballot.  Other people already did that for you.   Your grandparents, your great grandparents might be here today if they were working on it.  What's your excuse?", "filename": "07May2016HowardUniversityCommencementAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Obama.  Moscow and Washington, not for the first time, agree on a reduction of strategic offensive arms, but as you have mentioned, Russia and the United States are not the only countries having nuclear weapons.  So how specifically can the documents achieved -- well, similar to todays document on limitation on nuclear arms -- how soon we will see others sign this document?  And will you move along this track together with Russia? And to the President of the Russian Federation, you have mentioned the fact that sometimes theres an impression that Moscow and Washington are unable to agree on anything else but a mutual reduction of arms.  So will we see any things that will counter such a statement?

Let me begin by thanking Nicole, and Ian, for your brave words.  I want to thank them and all the Newtown families who have come here today, including your First Selectman, Pat Llodra.  Nobody could be more eloquent than Nicole and the other families on this issue. And we are so grateful for their courage and willingness to share their stories again and again, understanding that nothing is going to be more important in making sure the Congress moves forward this week than hearing from them. I want to thank all the educators from Sandy Hook Elementary who have come here as well the survivors -- Audience Members: We love you, Obama! President Obama: I love you back. I do. -- the survivors who still mourn and grieve, but are still going to work every day to love and raise those precious children in their care as fiercely as ever. I want to thank Governor Malloy for his leadership.  Very proud of him. I want to thank the University of Hartford for hosting us this afternoon.  Thank you, Hawks. And I want to thank the people of Connecticut for everything you've done to honor the memories of the victims -- because you're part of their family as well. One of your recent alumni, Rachel D'Avino, was a behavioral therapist at Sandy Hook. Two alumni of your performing arts school, Jimmy Greene and Nelba Marquez-Greene, lost their daughter, Ana -- an incredible, vibrant young girl who looked up to them, and learned from them, and inherited their talents by singing before she could talk. So every family in this state was shaken by the tragedy of that morning. Every family in this country was shaken. We hugged our kids more tightly. We asked what could we do, as a society, to help prevent a tragedy like that from happening again. And as a society, we decided that we have to change. We must. We must change. I noticed that Nicole and others refer to that day as \"12/14.\" For these families, it was a day that changed everything. And I know many of you in Newtown wondered if the rest of us would live up to the promise we made in those dark days -- if we'd change, too; or if once the television trucks left, once the candles flickered out, once the teddy bears were carefully gathered up, that the country would somehow move on to other things. Over the weekend, I heard Francine Wheeler, who lost her son Ben that day, say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some, but for her, it feels like it's been years since she saw Ben. And she's determined not to let what happened that day just fade away. \"We're not going anywhere,\" she said. \"We are here. And we are going to be here.\" And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown, everybody who was impacted. And, Newtown, we want you to know that we're here with you. We will not walk away from the promises we've made.  We are as determined as ever to do what must be done. In fact, I'm here to ask you to help me show that we can get it done. We're not forgetting. We can't forget. Your families still grieve in ways most of us can't comprehend. But so many of you have used that grief to make a difference -- not just to honor your own children, but to protect the lives of all of our children. So many of you have mobilized, and organized, and petitioned your elected officials \"with love and logic,\" as Nicole put it -- as citizens determined to right something gone wrong. And last week, here in Connecticut, your elected leaders responded. The Connecticut legislature, led by many of the legislators here today, passed new measures to protect more of our children and our communities from gun violence. And Governor Malloy signed that legislation into law. So I want to be clear. You, the families of Newtown, people across Connecticut, you helped make that happen. Your voices, your determination made that happen. Obviously, the elected leaders did an extraordinary job moving it forward, but it couldn't have happened if they weren't hearing from people in their respective districts, people all across the state. That's the power of your voice. And, by the way, Connecticut is not alone. In the past few months, New York, Colorado, Maryland have all passed new, common-sense gun safety reforms as well. These are all states that share an awful familiarity with gun violence, whether it's the horror of mass killings, or the street crime that's too common in too many neighborhoods. All of these states also share a strong tradition of hunting, and sport shooting, and gun ownership. It's been a part of the fabric of people's lives for generations. And every single one of those states -- including here in Connecticut -- decided that, yes, we can protect more of our citizens from gun violence while still protecting our Second Amendment rights. Those two things don't contradict each other.  We can pass common-sense laws that protect our kids and protect our rights. So Connecticut has shown the way. And now is the time for Congress to do the same.  Now is the time for Congress to do the same. This week is the time for Congress to do the same. Now, back in January, just a few months after the tragedy in Newtown, I announced a series of executive actions to reduce gun violence and keep our kids safe. And I put forward common-sense proposals -- much like those that passed here in Connecticut -- for Congress to consider. And you'll remember in my State of the Union address, I urged Congress to give those proposals a vote. And that moment is now. As soon as this week, Congress will begin debating these common-sense proposals to reduce gun violence. Your senators, Dick Blumenthal and Chris Murphy -- they're here -- your Representatives, John Larson, Rosa DeLauro, Elizabeth Esty, Jim Hines, Joe Courtney, they are all pushing to pass this legislation.  But much of Congress is going to only act if they hear from you, the American people. So here's what we have to do. Audience Member: I love you, Mr. President. President Obama: I appreciate that.  Here's what we've got to do. We have to tell Congress it's time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun so that people who are dangerous to themselves and others cannot get their hands on a gun. Let's make that happen. We have to tell Congress it's time to crack down on gun trafficking so that folks will think twice before buying a gun as part of a scheme to arm someone who won't pass a background check. Let's get that done. We have to tell Congress it's time to restore the ban on military-style assault weapons, and a 10-round limit for magazines, to make it harder for a gunman to fire 154 bullets into his victims in less than five minutes. Let's put that to a vote. We have to tell Congress it's time to strengthen school safety and help people struggling with mental health problems get the treatment they need before it's too late. Let's do that for our kids and for our communities. Now, I know that some of these proposals inspire more debate than others, but each of them has the support of the majority of the American people. All of them are common sense. All of them deserve a vote. All of them deserve a vote. Consider background checks. Over the past 20 years, background checks have kept more than 2 million dangerous people from getting their hands on a gun. A group of police officers in Colorado told me last week that, thanks to background checks, they've been able to stop convicted murderers, folks under restraining orders for committing violent domestic abuse from buying a gun. In some cases, they've actually arrested the person as they were coming to purchase the gun. So we know that background checks can work. But the problem is loopholes in the current law let so many people avoid background checks altogether. That's not safe. It doesn't make sense. If you're a law-abiding citizen and you go through a background check to buy a gun, wouldn't you expect other people to play by the same rules? If you're a law-abiding gun seller, wouldn't you want to know you're not selling your gun to someone who's likely to commit a crime?  Shouldn't we make it harder, not easier for somebody who is convicted of domestic abuse to get his hands on a gun? It turns out 90 percent of Americans think so. Ninety percent of Americans support universal background checks. Think about that. How often do 90 percent of Americans agree on anything?  And yet, 90 percent agree on this -- Republicans, Democrats, folks who own guns, folks who don't own guns; 80 percent of Republicans, more than 80 percent of gun owners, more than 70 percent of NRA households. It is common sense. And yet, there is only one thing that can stand in the way of change that just about everybody agrees on, and that's politics in Washington. You would think that with those numbers Congress would rush to make this happen. That's what you would think.  If our democracy is working the way it's supposed to, and 90 percent of the American people agree on something, in the wake of a tragedy you'd think this would not be a heavy lift. And yet, some folks back in Washington are already floating the idea that they may use political stunts to prevent votes on any of these reforms. Think about that. They're not just saying they'll vote \"no\" on ideas that almost all Americans support. They're saying they'll do everything they can to even prevent any votes on these provisions. They're saying your opinion doesn't matter. And that's not right. Audience: Booo -- President Obama: That is not right. Audience: We want a vote! President Obama: We need a vote. Audience: We want a vote! We want a vote! President Obama: We need a vote. Audience: We want a vote! President Obama:  Now, I've also heard some in the Washington press suggest that what happens to gun violence legislation in Congress this week will either be a political victory or defeat for me. Connecticut, this is not about me. This is not about politics. This is about doing the right thing for all the families who are here that have been torn apart by gun violence.  It's about them and all the families going forward, so we can prevent this from happening again. That's what it's about. It's about the law enforcement officials putting their lives at risk. That's what this is about. This is not about politics.  This is not about politics. This is about these families and families all across the country who are saying let's make it a little harder for our kids to get gunned down. When I said in my State of the Union address that these proposals deserve a vote -- that families of Newtown, and Aurora, and Tucson, and a former member of Congress, Gabby Giffords, that they all deserved a vote - virtually every member of that chamber stood up and applauded. And now they're going to start denying your families a vote when the cameras are off and when the lobbyists have worked what they do? You deserve better than that. You deserve a vote. Now, look, we knew from the beginning of this debate that change would not be easy. We knew that there would be powerful interests that are very good at confusing the subject, that are good at amplifying conflict and extremes, that are good at drowning out rational debate, good at ginning up irrational fears, all of which stands in the way of progress. But if our history teaches us anything, then it's up to us - the people - to stand up to those who say we can't, or we won't; stand up for the change that we need. And I believe that that's what the American people are looking for. When I first ran for this office, I said that I did not believe the country was as divided as our politics would suggest, and I still believe that.  I know sometimes, when you watch cable news or talk radio, or you browse the Internet, you'd think, man, everybody just hates each other, everybody is just at each other's throats. But that's not how most Americans think about these issues. There are good people on both sides of every issue. So if we're going to move forward, we can't just talk past one another. We've got to listen to one another. That's what Governor Malloy and all these legislative leaders did. That's why they were able to pass bipartisan legislation. I've got stacks of letters from gun owners who want me to know that they care passionately about their right to bear arms, don't want them infringed upon, and I appreciate every one of those letters. I've learned from them. But a lot of those letters, what they've also said is they're not just gun owners; they're also parents or police officers or veterans, and they agree that we can't stand by and keep letting these tragedies happen; that with our rights come some responsibilities and obligations to our communities and ourselves, and most of all to our children. We can't just think about \"us\" -- we've got to think about \"we, the people.\" I was in Colorado. I told a story about Michelle. She came back from a trip to rural Iowa; we were out there campaigning. Sometimes it would be miles between farms, let alone towns. And she said, you know, coming back, I can understand why somebody would want a gun for protection. If somebody drove up into the driveway and, Barack, you weren't home, the sheriff lived miles away, I might want that security. So she can understand what it might be like in terms of somebody wanting that kind of security. On the other hand, I also talked to a hunter last week who said, all my experiences with guns have been positive, but I also realize that for others, all their experiences with guns have been negative. And when he said that, I thought about the mom I met from suburban Chicago whose son was killed in a random shooting. And this mom told me, I hate it when people tell me that my son was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was on his way to school. He was exactly where he was supposed to be. He was in the right place at the right time, and he still got shot. The kids at Sandy Hook were where they were supposed to be. So were those moviegoers in Aurora. So were those worshippers in Oak Creek. So was Gabby Giffords. She was at a supermarket, listening to the concerns of her constituents. They were exactly where they were supposed to be. They were also exercising their rights -- to assemble peaceably; to worship freely and safely. They were exercising the rights of life and liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. So surely, we can reconcile those two things. Surely, America doesn't have to be divided between rural and urban, and Democrat and Republican when it comes to something like this. If you're an American who wants to do something to prevent more families from knowing the immeasurable anguish that these families here have known, then we have to act. Now is the time to get engaged. Now is the time to get involved. Now is the time to push back on fear, and frustration, and misinformation. Now is the time for everybody to make their voices heard from every state house to the corridors of Congress. And I'm asking everyone listening today, find out where your member of Congress stands on this. If they're not part of the 90 percent of Americans who agree on background checks, then ask them, why not? Why wouldn't you want to make it easier for law enforcement to do their job? Why wouldn't you want to make it harder for a dangerous person to get his or her hands on a gun? What's more important to you: our children, or an A-grade from the gun lobby? I've heard Nicole talk about what her life has been like since Dylan was taken from her in December. And one thing she said struck me. She said, \"Every night, I beg for him to come to me in my dreams so that I can see him again. And during the day, I just focus on what I need to do to honor him and make change.\" Now, if Nicole can summon the courage to do that, how can the rest of us do any less? How can we do any less? If there is even one thing we can do to protect our kids, don't we have an obligation to try? If there is even one step we can take to keep somebody from murdering dozens of innocents in the span of minutes, shouldn't we be taking that step?  If there is just one thing we can do to keep one father from having to bury his child, isn't that worth fighting for?", "filename": "08April2013GunViolenceReductionSpeechinConnecticut.txt"}, {"question": "Audience:  No! President Obama:  Never.  Audience Member:  Don't come to California. President Obama:  All right.  Well, listen, it is wonderful to see all of you.  First of all, please give Mark another round of applause for his hospitality.  And thanks to everyone at Nike for hosting us today, here in Federer Platz.  You know, the White House is cool.  Weve got a basketball court -- actually, it's a tennis court that we repainted some lines -- when I came into office.  So it's a combination basketball-tennis court.  There is a putting green that President Eisenhower put in.  Can you imagine, by the way, if I had put in a putting green?  Things have changed.    But youve got all that and the 18th tee box from Pebble Beach.  Come on.  Im sure some of my staff is running around right now in the Michael Jordan and Mia Hamm buildings -- they want to be lab rats for your new gear.  But it is wonderful to be here.  Please give it up for two people who fight every single day for Oregon workers -- your Representatives in Congress -- they do a great job -- Earl Blumenauer and Suzanne Bonamici.  They are both here.  Give them a big round of applause.  Yay!  And there are two people who couldn't make it here today, but theyre doing a great job and you should give them a round of applause as well, and that's Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Kurt Schrader.    So it is great to be at the world headquarters of such an iconic company -- a company that helps athletes succeed from the individual to the world stage.  And as youve heard, Ive come to Oregon to talk a little bit about trade -- which initially may have had some people thinking, what, is Mariota going someplace that we didnt know about?  Hes going to be great. Hes an outstanding young man.  Hes going to be terrific -- and from Hawaii, by the way.  Local boy.  But this is important, and I want to tell you why I think trade deals and our willingness to go out there and compete on the global stage is so important. Before I came out here, I had a chance to meet with some  small business owners from across Oregon, whose workers make everything from bikes to tea to stationery to wine.  And they know how important this is to them.  Sometimes when we talk about trade, we think of Nike, or we think of Boeing, or we think of G.E. -- we think about these big multinational companies.  But those small business leaders came here today because they understood that these markets outside the United States will help them grow, and will help them hire more folks -- just as all the suppliers to Nike or Boeing or G.E. or any of these other companies understand this is going to be critical to their growth and their ability to create new jobs. In fact, thats why Ron Wyden is not here -- because hes in Washington, D.C. as we speak quarterbacking this effort on behalf of Oregons small business owners and workers. Now, small businesses are the backbone of our economy.  Eventually, like Nike, they grow sometimes into really, really big companies.  They employ millions of people; 98 percent of exporters are small businesses.  Theyre the ones who make Made in Oregon and Made in the USA mean something.  And they represent something essential about this country -- the notion that if youve got a good idea and youre willing to work at it, you can turn that idea into a business, you can growth that business, and eventually, who knows what might happen.  You can give other people a chance to earn a living even as you do well.  Thats Americas promise.  And its up to us to keep that promise alive. Now, that promise was threatened for almost everybody just about seven years ago, when the economy nearly collapsed, and millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes and their life savings.  But thanks to the hard work of the American people and entrepreneurs like the ones who are here today -- and some pretty good policies from my Administration -- were in a different place today.  We're in a different place today. This morning, we learned that our economy created 223,000 new jobs last month.  The unemployment rate ticked down again to 5.4 percent -- which is the lowest its been in almost seven years.  Thats 3 million new jobs over the past 12 months -- nearly the fastest pace in over a decade.  And all told, over the past 62 months in a row, Americas businesses have created 12.3 million new jobs. I should add, by the way, 62 months ago is when I signed the Affordable Care Act.  So, obviously, it hasnt done too bad in terms of employment in this country.  I just thought Id mention that.  Since there were a lot of predictions of doom and gloom, I would just suggest those who were making those predictions go back and check the statistics.  Just saying. So small businesses deserve a lot of credit for that.  In fact, over the past several years, small businesses have created nearly two out of every three new American jobs.  And the question is, how do we build on that success?  Weve got to be relentless in our efforts to support small businesses who are creating jobs and helping to grow the economy. And thats been the purpose behind many of the policies Ive fought for as President.  Ive cut taxes for small businesses more than a dozen times.  Ive pushed for investments in infrastructure and faster Internet.  Its why weve made health care more accessible, affordable, portable -- to give people the freedom to change jobs or launch that startup without worrying about losing their health insurance. And passing trade agreements is part of that agenda if those trade agreements are the right kinds of trade agreements; if they make sure that theyre growing our businesses, and helping American workers by selling goods Made in America across the rest of the world. And Ive been talking a lot about this lately, because I view smart trade agreements as a vital piece of middle-class economics.  Not a contradiction to middle-class economics, its a part and parcel of it. I believe that our country does best when everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everybody plays by the same set of rules.  And that means making sure everybody has got a good education.  It means making sure that women are getting paid the same as men for doing the same work.  It means making sure that folks have to have sick leave and family leave and that they can balance work and family in a fair way.  It means, working to increase the minimum wage all across this country -- because folks who have some of the toughest jobs oftentimes get the lowest pay. Thats all part of middle-class economics, but, you know what, so is trade.  We strive to make sure our own economy lives up to high standards, but in a lot of parts of the world, the rules are unfair.  The playing field is uneven.  That puts American businesses and American workers at a disadvantage.  So the question is, what should we do about it? Some folks think we should just withdraw and not even try to engage in trade with these countries.  I disagree.  We have to make sure America writes the rules of the global economy.  And we should do it today, while our economy is in the position of global strength.  Because if we dont write the rules for trade around the world -- guess what -- China will.  And theyll write those rules in a way that gives Chinese workers and Chinese businesses the upper hand, and locks American-made goods out. Thats the choice we face.  We're not going to be able to isolate ourselves from world markets.  We got to be in there and compete.  And the question is, are we going to make sure that the rules are fair so that our businesses and our workers are on a level playing field.  Because when they are, we win every time.  When the rules are fair, we win every time. So this is why Im such a strong supporter of new trade agreements.  They're going to help our workers compete and our businesses compete.  This is not a left issue or a right issue, or a business or a labor issue.  It is about fairness and equity and access.  And like other issues that weve waged slow, steady fights on over the last seven years, this is also a question of the past versus the future. So the Trans-Pacific Partnership that were working on, its the biggest trade deal that we're working on right now -- has to do with the Asia Pacific region.  And it reflects our values in ways that, frankly, some previous trade agreements did not.  Its the highest-standard, most progressive trade deal in history.  Its got strong, enforceable provisions for workers, preventing things like child labor.  Its got strong, enforceable provisions on the environment, helping us to do things that havent been done before, to prevent wildlife trafficking, or deforestation, or dealing with our oceans.   And these are enforceable in the agreement. And Nike operates in the Pacific region, so they understand the competitive pressures they're under.  Nike has factories all around the world.  And lets face it, Mark I think doesn't mind me saying it that some of these countries, they don't have the standards for wages and labor conditions that we have here. So when you look at a country like Vietnam, under this agreement, Vietnam would actually, for the first time, have to raise its labor standards.  It would have to set a minimum wage. It would have to pass safe workplace laws to protect its workers. It would even have to protect workers freedom to form unions -- for the very first time.  That would make a difference.  That helps to level the playing field -- and it would be good for the workers in Vietnam, even as it helps make sure that theyre not undercutting competition here in the United States. So thats progress.  It doesnt mean that suddenly working conditions in Vietnam will be like they are here at Nike.  Or here in Portland right away.  But it moves us in the right direction. And if Vietnam, or any of the other countries in this trade agreement dont meet these requirements, theyll face meaningful consequences.  If youre a country that wants in to this agreement, you have to meet higher standards.  If you dont, youre out.  If you break the rules, there are actual repercussions.  And thats good for American businesses and American workers, because we already meet higher standards than most of the rest of the world, and that helps level the playing field. And this deal would strengthen our hand overseas by giving us the tools to open other markets to our goods and services and make sure they play by the fair rules we help write.  The truth is, we have one of the most open markets in the world.  Folks are already selling stuff here.  We got to be able to sell there.  That requires us to enter into trade agreements to open up their markets. I hear Oregon wine is actually pretty good.  Somebody told me that the pinot noir in Oregon is top-notch, right?  Ive got some winemakers right here.  Well, I want to make sure Japanese wine consumers have the opportunity to partake -- in our excellent Oregon wine. We got some Oregon beef producers and ranchers around here.   Beef is really expensive in Japan.  Lets make sure they try some Oregon steaks.  Its good stuff. And thats one of the best things that can happen for our businesses and our workers -- opening up markets that have previously been closed, particularly markets where theyre already selling stuff here.  Theres a lack of reciprocity.  Its not a fair deal right now.  We want to make it fair. Now, I want to acknowledge -- because this looks like a very well-read and informed crowd -- that there have been a bunch of critics about trade deals generally and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And whats interesting is typically theyre my friends, coming from my party, and theyre my fellow travelers on minimum wage and on job training and on clean energy.  On every progressive issue, theyre right there with me. And then on this one, theyre like whooping on me. But I tell you what.  Ive run my last election, and the only reason I do something is because I think its good for American workers and the American people and the American economy.  I dont have any other rationale for doing what I do than I think its the best thing for the American people.  And on this issue, on trade, I actually think some of my dearest friends are wrong.  Theyre just wrong.  And heres why. First of all, they say that this trade agreement will cost American jobs.  And theyre really basing this on some past experience, looking at what happened in the 90s, over the last 20 years, as there was a lot of outsourcing going on.  And you know what, past trade agreements, its true, didnt always reflect our values or didnt always do enough to protect American workers.  But thats why were designing a different kind of trade deal. And the truth is that companies that only care about low wages, theyve already moved.  They dont need new trade deals to move.  Theyve already outsourced.  Theyve already located in search of low wages. What this trade agreement would do is open the doors to the higher-skill, higher-wage jobs of the future -- jobs that we excel at.  It would make sure our manufacturers who are operating at the higher end of the value chain are able to access these growing markets.  And the fact is, over the past few years, our manufacturers have been steadily creating jobs for the first time since the 1990s -- under my Administration.  After more than a decade away from the top spot, business leaders around the world have declared the United States is the worlds number one place to invest for a third year in a row.  Third year in a row. So the point is, outsourcing is already giving way to insourcing.  Companies are starting to move back here to do more advanced manufacturing, and this is a trend we expect to continue.  This trade deal would help that. Just this morning, as Mark may have mentioned, Nike announced that, with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, it will make new investments in advanced manufacturing -- not overseas, but right here in the United States.  And far more Nike products would be made in the U.S.A.  And that means thousands of new jobs in manufacturing and engineering and design at Nike facilities across the country, and potentially tens of thousands of new jobs along Nikes supply chain here at home.  Thats what trade can do. Look, Ive spent six and a half years trying to rescue this economy -- six and a half years of trying to revitalize American manufacturing, including rescuing an American auto industry that was on its back and is now fully recovered.  So I would not risk any of that if I thought the trade deals were going to undermine it.  The reason Im for this is because I think it will enhance it and advance it.  So thats point number one. Point number two -- when you ask folks specifically, what do you oppose about this trade deal, they just say NAFTA.  NAFTA was passed 20 years ago.  That was a different agreement.  And in fact, this agreement fixes some of what was wrong with NAFTA by making labor and environmental provisions actually enforceable.  I was just getting out of law school when NAFTA got passed. Number three -- youve got some critics saying that any deal would be rushed through; its a secret deal, people dont know whats in it.  This is not true.  Any agreement that we finalize with the other 11 countries will have to be posted online for at least 60 days before I even sign it.  Then it would go to Congress -- and you know theyre not going to do anything fast.  So there will be months of review.  Every T crossed, every I dotted.  Everybody is going to be able to see exactly whats in it. Theres nothing fast-track about this.  This is a very deliberate track -- which will be fully subject to scrutiny.  And Im confident when people read the agreement for themselves, theyll see that this is the most progressive trade deal in history. Number four -- critics warn that parts of this deal would undermine American regulation -- food safety, worker safety, even financial regulations.  Theyre making this stuff up.  This is just not true.  No trade agreement is going to force us to change our laws.  This agreement would make sure our companies arent discriminated against in other countries. We already treat companies from other countries fairly here. But our companies dont always get treated fairly there.  So sometimes they need to have some way to settle disputes where its not subject to the whims of some government bureaucrat in that country.  Thats important.  We want our businesses to succeed in selling over there because that's how our workers will get more jobs here in the United States. And then finally, some critics talk about currency manipulation.  Now, this has been a problem in the past.  Some countries, they try to lower their currency so that it makes their goods cheaper, makes our more expensive.  There was a time when China was pretty egregious about this.  When I came into office, I started pounding on them.  Every time I meet with them, Id be talking about currency.  And we pushed back hard, and China moved.  In real terms, their currency has appreciated about 30 percent since I came into office.  And we're going to keep on going after it.  But thats not an argument against this trade agreement.  If we give up the chance to help our businesses sell their stuff in the worlds fastest-growing markets, that doesn't do anything to stop currency manipulation. So the fact is, some folks are just opposed to trade deals out of principle, a reflexive principle.  And what I tell them is, you know what, if you're opposed to these smart, progressive trade deals, then that means you must be satisfied with the status quo.  And the status quo hasnt been working for our workers.  It hasnt been working for our businesses.  And there are people here who will tell you why. Im going to just give you a couple of examples of small businesses who I had a chance to meet with today.  Egg Press is a Portland-based greeting card company.  Really nice. They sell their cards in Australia, which is a member of this Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  Their CEO, Tess Darrow -- wheres Tess?  Raise your hand.  I saw her.  There she is.  So Tess says that if they could more easily reach customers in Japan, as well, theyd sell half the volume that they do here in America.  Thats a lot. Right now, the logistics of exporting to Japan are too complicated.  Products end up being held up for months at the border.  This agreement would help solve some of those problems so Tess can sell more greeting cards in Japan -- presumably in Japanese.  Is there going to be -- there will be a translation process, I assume.  Yes, absolutely.  Im teasing. So the trade deal would help eliminate barriers, and simplify customs, and hold countries accountable for getting products delivered swiftly.  The more Tess sells, the more she can grow, the more she can hire here in Oregon, here in the United States. Oregon Fruit Products -- makes canned fruits, berries, other products -- depends on exports for 20 percent of its annual sales.  Right now, it exports to four members of this partnership that we're putting together:  Japan, Australia, Singapore, and Canada.  Unfortunately, selling in these countries right now can mean dealing with unfair rules designed to prevent our products from being offered in their markets.  Under this agreement, that would change.  Exporting becomes simpler, more consistent.  That means more people around the world eating Oregon berries all year long.  Berry tasty. Sokol Blosser Winery -- we got a lot of drinkers here.  Its a winery, family-run in Dayton, Oregon.  One of its top export markets is Japan.  Right now, there are high tariffs on American wine in that country.  Under this trade partnership, those tariffs would be eliminated, and wineries across America could see their sales grow overseas.  The brother  --and-sister team that runs this vineyard -- wave, guys -- they say, If we can make it easier to do business with countries that are already our trading partners, countries that are allies, thats a good thing. Theyre right.  This deal would be a good thing.  So lets just do it.  It took a while for you to catch that, didnt it?", "filename": "08May2015TranspacificTradePactSpeechatNikeHQ.txt"}, {"question": "Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, and fellow Americans: Tonight we meet at an urgent time for our country.  We continue to face an economic crisis that has left millions of our neighbors jobless, and a political crisis thats made things worse.  This past week, reporters have been asking, What will this speech mean for the President?  What will it mean for Congress?  How will it affect their polls, and the next election? But the millions of Americans who are watching right now, they dont care about politics.  They have real-life concerns.  Many have spent months looking for work.  Others are doing their best just to scrape by -- giving up nights out with the family to save on gas or make the mortgage; postponing retirement to send a kid to college.  These men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work and responsibility paid off.  They believed in a country where everyone gets a fair shake and does their fair share -- where if you stepped up, did your job, and were loyal to your company, that loyalty would be rewarded with a decent salary and good benefits; maybe a raise once in a while.  If you did the right thing, you could make it.  Anybody could make it in America.  For decades now, Americans have watched that compact erode.  They have seen the decks too often stacked against them.  And they know that Washington has not always put their interests first.  The people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities.  The question tonight is whether well meet ours.  The question is whether, in the face of an ongoing national crisis, we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy.  The question is -- the question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning.     Those of us here tonight cant solve all our nations woes.  Ultimately, our recovery will be driven not by Washington, but by our businesses and our workers.  But we can help.  We can make a difference.  There are steps we can take right now to improve peoples lives.  I am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass right away.  Its called the American Jobs Act.  There should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation.  Everything in here is the kind of proposal thats been supported by both Democrats and Republicans -- including many who sit here tonight.  And everything in this bill will be paid for.  Everything. The purpose of the American Jobs Act is simple:  to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working.  It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs for teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for long-term unemployed. It will provide -- it will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working American and every small business. It will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled, and give companies confidence that if they invest and if they hire, there will be customers for their products and services.  You should pass this jobs plan right away. Everyone here knows that small businesses are where most new jobs begin.  And you know that while corporate profits have come roaring back, smaller companies havent.  So for everyone who speaks so passionately about making life easier for job creators, this plan is for you. Pass this jobs bill -- pass this jobs bill, and starting tomorrow, small businesses will get a tax cut if they hire new workers or if they raise workers wages.  Pass this jobs bill, and all small business owners will also see their payroll taxes cut in half next year. If you have 50 employees -- if you have 50 employees making an average salary, thats an $80,000 tax cut.  And all businesses will be able to continue writing off the investments they make in 2012.  Its not just Democrats who have supported this kind of proposal.  Fifty House Republicans have proposed the same payroll tax cut thats in this plan.  You should pass it right away. Pass this jobs bill, and we can put people to work rebuilding America.  Everyone here knows we have badly decaying roads and bridges all over the country.  Our highways are clogged with traffic.  Our skies are the most congested in the world.  Its an outrage.    Building a world-class transportation system is part of what made us a economic superpower.  And now were going to sit back and watch China build newer airports and faster railroads?  At a time when millions of unemployed construction workers could build them right here in America? There are private construction companies all across America just waiting to get to work.  Theres a bridge that needs repair between Ohio and Kentucky thats on one of the busiest trucking routes in North America.  A public transit project in Houston that will help clear up one of the worst areas of traffic in the country.  And there are schools throughout this country that desperately need renovating.  How can we expect our kids to do their best in places that are literally falling apart?", "filename": "08September2011SpeechtoaJointSessionofCongressonEconomyandJobs.txt"}, {"question": "This approach is basically the one Ive been advocating for months.  In addition to the trillion dollars of spending cuts Ive already signed into law, its a balanced plan that would reduce the deficit by making additional spending cuts, by making modest adjustments to health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and by reforming our tax code in a way that asks the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share. Whats more, the spending cuts wouldnt happen so abruptly that theyd be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right away.   Now, I realize there are some in my party who dont think we should make any changes at all to Medicare and Medicaid, and I understand their concerns.  But heres the truth:  Millions of Americans rely on Medicare in their retirement.  And millions more will do so in the future.  They pay for this benefit during their working years.  They earn it.  But with an aging population and rising health care costs, we are spending too fast to sustain the program.  And if we dont gradually reform the system while protecting current beneficiaries, it wont be there when future retirees need it.  We have to reform Medicare to strengthen it. I am also -- Im also well aware that there are many Republicans who dont believe we should raise taxes on those who are most fortunate and can best afford it.  But here is what every American knows:  While most people in this country struggle to make ends meet, a few of the most affluent citizens and most profitable corporations enjoy tax breaks and loopholes that nobody else gets.  Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary -- an outrage he has asked us to fix.  We need a tax code where everyone gets a fair shake and where everybody pays their fair share. And by the way, I believe the vast majority of wealthy Americans and CEOs are willing to do just that if it helps the economy grow and gets our fiscal house in order.    Ill also offer ideas to reform a corporate tax code that stands as a monument to special interest influence in Washington.  By eliminating pages of loopholes and deductions, we can lower one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. Our tax code should not give an advantage to companies that can afford the best-connected lobbyists.  It should give an advantage to companies that invest and create jobs right here in the United States of America. So we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for this jobs plan in the process.  But in order to do this, we have to decide what our priorities are.  We have to ask ourselves, Whats the best way to grow the economy and create jobs? Should we keep tax loopholes for oil companies?  Or should we use that money to give small business owners a tax credit when they hire new workers?  Because we cant afford to do both.  Should we keep tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires?  Or should we put teachers back to work so our kids can graduate ready for college and good jobs? Right now, we cant afford to do both.   This isnt political grandstanding.  This isnt class warfare.  This is simple math.  This is simple math.  These are real choices.  These are real choices that weve got to make.  And Im pretty sure I know what most Americans would choose.  Its not even close.  And its time for us to do whats right for our future. Now, the American Jobs Act answers the urgent need to create jobs right away.  But we cant stop there.  As Ive argued since I ran for this office, we have to look beyond the immediate crisis and start building an economy that lasts into the future -- an economy that creates good, middle-class jobs that pay well and offer security.  We now live in a world where technology has made it possible for companies to take their business anywhere.  If we want them to start here and stay here and hire here, we have to be able to out-build and out-educate and out-innovate every other country on Earth. And this task of making America more competitive for the long haul, thats a job for all of us.  For government and for private companies.  For states and for local communities -- and for every American citizen.  All of us will have to up our game.  All of us will have to change the way we do business.  My administration can and will take some steps to improve our competitiveness on our own.  For example, if youre a small business owner who has a contract with the federal government, were going to make sure you get paid a lot faster than you do right now. Were also planning to cut away the red tape that prevents too many rapidly growing startup companies from raising capital and going public.  And to help responsible homeowners, were going to work with federal housing agencies to help more people refinance their mortgages at interest rates that are now near 4 percent.  Thats a step -- I know you guys must be for this, because thats a step that can put more than $2,000 a year in a familys pocket, and give a lift to an economy still burdened by the drop in housing prices.  So, some things we can do on our own.  Other steps will require congressional action.  Today you passed reform that will speed up the outdated patent process, so that entrepreneurs can turn a new idea into a new business as quickly as possible. Thats the kind of action we need.  Now its time to clear the way for a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American companies to sell their products in Panama and Colombia and South Korea - while also helping the workers whose jobs have been affected by global competition. If Americans can buy Kias and Hyundais, I want to see folks in South Korea driving Fords and Chevys and Chryslers. I want to see more products sold around the world stamped with the three proud words:  Made in America.  Thats what we need to get done. And on all of our efforts to strengthen competitiveness, we need to look for ways to work side by side with Americas businesses.  Thats why Ive brought together a Jobs Council of leaders from different industries who are developing a wide range of new ideas to help companies grow and create jobs.  Already, weve mobilized business leaders to train 10,000 American engineers a year, by providing company internships and training.  Other businesses are covering tuition for workers who learn new skills at community colleges.  And were going to make sure the next generation of manufacturing takes root not in China or Europe, but right here, in the United States of America. If we provide the right incentives, the right support -- and if we make sure our trading partners play by the rules -- we can be the ones to build everything from fuel-efficient cars to advanced biofuels to semiconductors that we sell all around the world.  Thats how America can be number one again.  And thats how America will be number one again.     Now, I realize that some of you have a different theory on how to grow the economy.  Some of you sincerely believe that the only solution to our economic challenges is to simply cut most government spending and eliminate most government regulations. Well, I agree that we cant afford wasteful spending, and Ill work with you, with Congress, to root it out.  And I agree that there are some rules and regulations that do put an unnecessary burden on businesses at a time when they can least afford it.  Thats why I ordered a review of all government regulations.  So far, weve identified over 500 reforms, which will save billions of dollars over the next few years.  We should have no more regulation than the health, safety and security of the American people require.  Every rule should meet that common-sense test.  But what we cant do -- what I will not do -- is let this economic crisis be used as an excuse to wipe out the basic protections that Americans have counted on for decades. I reject the idea that we need to ask people to choose between their jobs and their safety.  I reject the argument that says for the economy to grow, we have to roll back protections that ban hidden fees by credit card companies, or rules that keep our kids from being exposed to mercury, or laws that prevent the health insurance industry from shortchanging patients.  I reject the idea that we have to strip away collective bargaining rights to compete in a global economy. We shouldnt be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards.  America should be in a race to the top.  And I believe we can win that race. In fact, this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government, refund everybodys money, and let everyone write their own rules, and tell everyone theyre on their own -- thats not who we are.  Thats not the story of America.    Yes, we are rugged individualists.  Yes, we are strong and self-reliant.  And it has been the drive and initiative of our workers and entrepreneurs that has made this economy the engine and the envy of the world. But theres always been another thread running throughout our history -- a belief that were all connected, and that there are some things we can only do together, as a nation. We all remember Abraham Lincoln as the leader who saved our Union.  Founder of the Republican Party.  But in the middle of a civil war, he was also a leader who looked to the future -- a Republican President who mobilized government to build the Transcontinental Railroad -- launch the National Academy of Sciences, set up the first land grant colleges. And leaders of both parties have followed the example he set.  Ask yourselves -- where would we be right now if the people who sat here before us decided not to build our highways, not to build our bridges, our dams, our airports?  What would this country be like if we had chosen not to spend money on public high schools, or research universities, or community colleges?  Millions of returning heroes, including my grandfather, had the opportunity to go to school because of the G.I. Bill.  Where would we be if they hadnt had that chance?   How many jobs would it have cost us if past Congresses decided not to support the basic research that led to the Internet and the computer chip?  What kind of country would this be if this chamber had voted down Social Security or Medicare just because it violated some rigid idea about what government could or could not do?  How many Americans would have suffered as a result?", "filename": "08September2011SpeechtoaJointSessionofCongressonEconomyandJobs.txt"}, {"question": "President.

I want to thank the University of the West Indies for hosting us.  Big up, You-Wee! Thank you.  Ive been making myself at home here.    It is great to be in beautiful Jamaica -- not only because Im proud to be the first President of the United States to visit in more than 30 years, but because I just like the vibe here. I was born on an island, and it was warm, and so I feel right at home.  And Im grateful for the warm Jamaican hospitality that I received this morning, including from Prime Minister Simpson-Miller.  I also had the chance to meet with leaders from across the Caribbean, where we focused on issues of shared prosperity and shared security.  And tomorrow, Ill meet with leaders from across the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas in Panama.  But before my trip became all business, I wanted to come here and hear from young people like you.  Because it is your generation who will shape the future of our countries and our region and this planet that we share long after those of us who are currently in public service are gone from the stage. So Im going to only speak for a few minutes at the top, because Id rather spend time taking questions from you, and also because after we have a chance for our town hall, I get a chance to say hi to Usain Bolt and Shelly Ann Fraser-Pryce.  When you have the fastest people on the planet, youve got to say hi to them, right?  Because thats fast. There are a lot of people out there, and theyre the fastest.   Now, we are not just nations, were also neighbors.  Tens of millions of Americans are bound to the Caribbean and the Americas through ties of commerce, but also ties of kin.  More than one million Americans trace their ancestry to Jamaica.  More than one million Americans visit Jamaica each year.  So were committed to you and this region.  And as Ive said before, in our foreign policy there are no senior or junior partners in the Americas; there are just partners. And thats one reason why the United States has started a new chapter in our relations with the people of Cuba. We will continue to have some differences with the Cuban government, but we dont want to be imprisoned by the past.  When something doesnt work for 50 years, you dont just keep on doing it; you try something new. And we are as committed as ever to supporting human rights and political freedom in Cuba and around the world.  But I believe that engagement is a more powerful force than isolation, and the changes we are making can help improve the lives of the Cuban people.  And I also believe that this new beginning will be good for the United States and the entire hemisphere.  My point is, I believe we can move past some of the old debates that so often define the region, and move forward in a way that benefits your generation with new thinking -- an energetic, impatient, dynamic and diverse generation that you represent, both in the United States and across this hemisphere.  More than 100 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are between the ages of 15 and 24.  Most of the region is under 35.  And what gives me so much hope about your generation is that youre more interested in the hard work of waging peace than resorting to the quick impulses of conflict.  Youre more interested in the hard work of building prosperity through entrepreneurship, not cronyism or corruption. Youre more eager for progress that comes not by holding down any segment of society, but by holding up the rights of every human being, regardless of what we look like, or how we pray, or who we love.  You care less about the world as it has been, and more about the world as it should be and can be.  And unlike any other time in our history, the technology at your disposal means that you dont have to wait for the change that youre looking for; you have the freedom to create it in your own in powerful and disruptive ways.  Many of you already have, whether by starting your own enterprises or by helping others start theirs. And Im going to just single out two remarkable young leaders who are here today because I think theyre an example of what is possible, even in the most difficult of circumstances.  So Angeline Jackson is here today.  Where is Angeline?  There she is, right there.   Several years ago, when Angeline was 19, she and a friend were kidnapped, held at gunpoint and sexually assaulted.  And as a woman, and as a lesbian, justice and society were not always on her side.  But instead of remaining silent, she chose to speak out and started her own organization to advocate for women like her, and get them treatment and get them justice, and push back against stereotypes, and give them some sense of their own power. And she became a global activist.  But more than anything, she cares about her Jamaica, and making it a place where everybody, no matter their color, or their class, or their sexual orientation, can live in equality and opportunity.  Thats the power of one person, what they can do. Jerome Cowans grew up in a tough part of Kingston.  Wheres Jerome? When Jerome was 12, he saw a friend gunned down.  And when he looked at the shooters, he said, I realized that wasnt a life I wanted to live.  They had expensive machinery, but they had nothing else.  So at the ripe old age of 13, he founded a youth group to help others like him stay on the right path.  And he started small, with only six people, but they had one big thing in common and they believed that change was possible. And like Angeline, he was threatened for his work, but he kept at it.  And he said, Things wont get any better if no one does anything.  And today, the LEAD Youth Club he started has six chapters, including one in Colombia.  His work has taken him to five continents.  Last year, he became the first Jamaican to receive the Nelson Mandela Innovation Award.  Hes just 25 years old.    So individuals like those two young people -- the young people here today -- you remind me of something that Bob Marley once said.  You know I went to his house yesterday.   I thought, I'm only five minutes from his house, I got to go check it out. And one of the displays has to do when he was shot right before a concert he was supposed to give, trying to bring the political factions in Jamaica together.  And he was treated for his wounds and he went ahead with the program, went ahead with the show.  And somebody asked, well, why would you do that?  He said, The people who are trying to make this world worse are not taking the day off.  Why should I?  Why should I?    So none of us can afford to take the day off.  And I want you to have every chance, every tool you need to make this world better.  So today Im announcing nearly $70 million in U.S. investments in education, training, and employment programs for our young people throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. And these investments will help young people in unemployed and impoverished and marginalized communities, and give them a chance to gain the skills they need to compete and succeed in the 21st century economy. And thats not all.  As President, some of the initiatives Im most proud of are ones that increase my countrys engagement with the next generation of leaders like Angeline and Jerome and all of you -- leaders in government and civil society, and entrepreneurship and the private sector.  Four years ago, I launched an initiative called 100,000 Strong in the Americas.  And the goal was to have 100,000 U.S. students studying in this region, and 100,000 of this regions students studying in the United States by the end of this decade.  And we are on track to meet that goal.  So today, to build on that progress, Im proud to launch the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative right here in Kingston. Let me say this.  This is not your traditional exchange.  Were going to seek out the most innovative young entrepreneurs and civil society leaders in the Caribbean, Latin America, and we're going to give them a chance to earn a substantial continuum of the training and the resources and the connections, the networks and the capital that you need to make a difference. So this year, well bring two dozen entrepreneurs and civil society leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean -- including young Cuban leaders -- to the United States. Then next year, well increase this fellowship to 250 young leaders.  And well help you to expand your commercial and social ventures; we'll embed you in an American business and incubators.  Well give U.S. participants the chance to continue their collaboration with you in your home countries. So the idea is that youll get a chance to implement your ideas but now have linkages that give you access to capital and research and all the things you need to mobilize and implement the kinds of things that you're doing. And this isn't charity for us.  This is an investment in your future, because that means it's an investment in our future -- a future where climate researchers in the Amazon can collaborate with scientists in Alaska.  An idea in Barbados suddenly can be developed in an incubator in Boston.  Anti-gang activities in Honduras can be connected to similar activities in Houston, Texas.  Its a future where any kid from Kingston can choose a path that opens his or her horizons beyond their neighborhood to the wider world.  And that impulse to make the world better, to push back on those who try to make it worse, thats something that your generation has to hold on to.  And you have to remember, its never easy; there are no days off.  But if theres one thing that I know from my own life, its that with hard work and with hope, change is always within our reach. The Jamaican-American poet Claude McKay, who was a central figure of the Harlem renaissance, once wrote something along those lines:  We must strive on to gain the height although it may not be in sight.  As long as weve got young strivers like you -- and I hope to see you in Washington as part of this Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative -- Im confident that a brighter future will always be in sight. So thank you very much.  With that, lets take some questions. Alright? So.... So thank you very much.  With that, lets take some questions. Alright? So.... President Obama:  All right, since were getting to work Im going to take my jacket off and get comfortable.  All right.  There...are no rules to this except that there are people with microphones in the audience, so wait for them to come when I call on you.  Were going to go boy, girl, boy, girl so everybody gets a chance, so its fair.    Before your question, please introduce yourself and tell us where you are from, okay?  And try to keep your question or comment relatively short so we can get more questions or comments in, okay?  Well start with this young lady right here in the white blouse.  Its a little tight here. Question: Thank you.  Yani Campbell [ph], a lecturer at the University of the West Indies.  Thank you so much for your talk, very interesting.  And I wondered as well, on the Cuban issue, now that your policy has actually changed towards Cuba, I wondered about your views on how it is that we should approach -- CARICOM should approach its relationship with Cuba in terms of deepening that relationship.  Should they now perhaps move to join in CARICOM?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, first of all, I think CARICOM can make its own decisions and well respect it.  Cuba will be participating in the Summit of the Americas, and I think -- it is my strong belief that if we engage, that that offers the greatest prospect for escaping some of the constraints of the past. I think the Cuban people are extraordinary and have huge potential.  And whats encouraging is, is that the overwhelming majority of Cubans are interested in ending the Cold War -- the last vestige of the Cold War -- and moving forward.  Its going to take some time for the United States to fully implement some of the things that have already been agreed to, and its going to take a little bit longer before you actually have complete normal relations between the United States and Cuba.  What I would say to Caribbean countries is, absolutely, you should continue to engage in Cuba in the ways that youve already doing -- youve already done in the past.  I do think that it is important for all of us to be able to speak honestly where we see concerns about issues of human rights and political freedom.  And Im not saying anything publicly that I havent said directly to Raul Castro.  There are still constraints on the ability of the Cuban people to express themselves, or to organize political parties, or to start a business.  And sometimes, the same things we expect for ourselves and our country, somehow we think other people dont want.  But I believe that each country -- I believe each country has its own unique cultures, its own unique traditions.  I dont expect every country to pursue the same policies or have the same political practices as the United States.  And I am certainly aware of the flaws that exist in our own country that we have to fix.  But I do believe there are certain principles that are universal.  I think that all people want basic dignity and want basic freedom, and want to be able to worship as they please without being discriminated against, or they should be able to speak their mind about an important issue pertaining to their community without being arrested.  And so wherever we see that, we try to speak out.  But what we also try to do is engage and recognize that even with countries that we have differences, theres also going to be commonality and overlap.  And the United States and Cuba should both have an interest in dealing with climate change, for example, because when the oceans start lapping upon Miami or on Havana, nobody is going to distinguish, well, where do they stand on this or that ideological issue.  And so we have to find where there are areas of cooperation, but I will continue to try to be consistent in speaking out on behalf of the issues that are important to all people, not just some. All right, its a gentlemans turn.  This gentleman right here.  He looks very serious; hes got glasses.  Looking sharp.  Plus, hes got a copy of my book. So hes clearly a wise man. Question: Thank you very much.  My name is Chef Brian Lumley -- Im a young Jamaican chef here. And I own a restaurant -- 689 by Brian Lumley. Just saying. My question to you -- Im going to stay a little bit off the politics for a bit.  And Ive witnessed your journey a lot, and the question is kind of two-part.  If you go back and give yourself one piece of advice before the start of you 2008 term, what would it be?  And the second part is if you can sign this book when youre finished. Thank you very much. President Obama:  Ill sign the book.  So the question was, for those couldnt hear:  If I were to go back and give myself advice before I started in 2008, what would the advice be? I suppose I could have started dying my hair earlier -- so then people wouldnt say, man, hes getting old.  Youre going like this -- at least I got hair, man. Im teasing you.  Im messing with you.  I think that -- keep in mind that when I came into office we were going through the worst global financial crisis since the 1930s, and so we had to make a series of decisions very quickly, many of which were unpopular.  Overall, I think we got it right.  I think we did the right thing.  And because, I think, we took these steps, not only were we able to avoid the kind of Great Depression that we saw in the 1930s, not only was America able to bounce back and start growing more rapidly than most of our peers, drive down unemployment faster, create more jobs faster, but that also had an impact on the global economy and it had an impact on the Caribbean economy, that we were able to bounce back quicker than we might have if we hadn't taken those steps. But it was, I think, costly politically.  And what I would have probably advised was that I might have needed to warn the American people and paint a picture for them that was more accurate about the fact that it would take some time to dig ourselves out of a very big hole.  Because FDR, when he came into office, the Great Depression had already been going on for two, three years, and so people understood how serious it was.  With us, we came in just as people were really starting to feel the impacts.  And trying to paint a picture that we'll make it but it's going to take some time, and here are the steps that we need to take -- I think I would have advised myself to do a better job spending more time not just getting the policy right, but also describing it in ways that people understood, that gave them confidence in their own future.  I think that would probably be the most important advice that I would have given myself.    All right, it's a young ladys turn.  That young lady right there.  Yes, you.  You, yes.  Oh, well, I'll call on both of you.  I'll call on you later.  Go ahead. Question: Okay, so we're here and were looking at you, and we're all very honored to be here and very taken about by your leadership qualities.  And seeing that you are the President of the United States of America and youre so influential, I want to know how you handle the mental strain that comes with being in charge of so much. President Obama:  Whats your name? Question:  Kimberly -- from the University of the West Indies.  President Obama:  Fantastic.  How do I handle stress?  You know, I'll be honest with you.  One of the things that happens as you get older is you start appreciating both your strengths and your weaknesses.  Hopefully you gain a little wisdom about what you're good at and what you're not.  And Michelle can give you a long list of things I'm not good at. But one thing that I've always had, which has served me well, is a pretty good temperament.  And I attribute that partly from growing up on an island with trade winds and beaches, and it makes you calm.  But I try not to get too high when things are going well so that I don't get too low when things are going badly, and try to keep a long view of how the process of social change takes place, and how the trajectory of your own life is going to proceed. We get caught up in the day-to-day so much, and its interesting now when Im talking to my daughters and somebody said something at school, or theres -- well, I didnt do quite as well on that test as I wanted.  And you want them to take it seriously, but you also want to say to them, you know what, this, too, shall pass; I promise you three months from now, much less 30 years from now, you will not remember.  And so I think that trying to keep your eye on the prize of where it is that you want to go and not be discouraged or overly impressed with yourself on a day-to-day basis I think is very important.  And then you have to get some exercise in the morning. I dont run as fast as these folks, but I get a little exercise, which does help in terms of stress relief. All right.  Its a gentlemans turn.  Lets see, somebody from this side.  This young man right here in the sharp-looking checkered shirt. Question:  Good afternoon again, Mr. President.  Especially as it relates to human rights and social change -- Im Jomain McKenzie and Im a focal point with the Global Fund Board.  As it relates to human rights and social change, how do you make the decision to allow societies to go through the natural evolutionary process of having change occur on their own versus having governments exert policies to make these same political social changes? President Obama:  Thats a really interesting question.  Its an interesting question and its one that I have to struggle with all the time.  Every society, as I said, is at a different phase in development, in their own history; they have different cultural traditions.  And so the way I think about it is, is that the United States has certain core values and principles that we believe deeply in.  And we dont necessarily expect that every country will formulate how to secure those ideals and those principles.  We dont expect it to be done exactly as we do any more than we expect every -- obviously, our democracy is not the same as a Jamaican democracy or a British democracy or Australian democracy.  But we believe in democracy.  We think that if people have the ability to speak out about their own lives, some sense of agency, then that society will be stronger.  And that doesnt mean that we wont work with a country that doesnt precisely abide by those principles, but we will still speak out.  There are times where a country is clearly engaging in activities that are so egregious that its not culturally specific; it typically has to do with a government wanting to exert control over people and oppress them.  And in those instances, I think it is entirely appropriate for us to speak out forcibly and, in some cases, to not do business with them. Look at a country like North Korea.  I mean, obviously, Korean culture is different than American culture.  On the other hand, you look at whats happening in South Korea and you look at whats happening in North Korea and those are two entirely different societies.  And I can tell you which one youd rather live in.  And if you have a situation in which people are being murdered simply because they didnt agree with the government on something or didnt want their economic fate to be entirely determined by the whims of some government bureaucrat, and suddenly theyre sent to a labor camp -- thats something where we as an international community have to speak out on. And then there are some issues that may be culturally specific, but you know what, I think theyre wrong.  I wont -- were not going to try to force that country to change, but I may try to shame that country.  There are nations where slavery still exists.  And that may be part of the ancient culture in that society, but slavery is wrong.  And Im not going to give them the excuse that, well, this is who we are.  In Africa -- and I can speak I think fairly as somebody who is the son of an African father -- there are practices like female genital mutilation that may be part of the tradition there, but its wrong.  And Im going to say so.  And it will be U.S. policy to say that its wrong.  So the tools we use to try to bring about change around the world may vary.  And as I said earlier, were not always perfectly consistent.  There are times where weve got allies who are not observing all the human rights we would like, and there are times where there are countries that are adversaries of ours where they do some things quite well.  And you cant expect us, or any country, to be perfectly consistent in every circumstance.  But what Ive tried to do is be fairly consistent in terms of what we believe, what we stand for, and then we use different tools depending on what we think will bring about the most change.  In some cases, it will just be a diplomatic statement; in some cases, it may be serious enough that we will organize -- try to organize the United Nations or other multilateral forums to speak out against certain practices.  In some cases, it may be so egregious that we need to sanction them, and we will try to organize the international community in that way. And then finally, in the ultimate circumstance, where the violations of our values are so severe that they start spilling over and -- in the instance of, for example, genocide -- we may be say to ourselves, in concert with the international community, we need to intervene because this government is so brutal and so unacceptable that we need to protect people.  But we do that in the context of an international conversation so that were not simply making these decisions -- or were not so arrogant that were not paying attention to what the rest of the world community is saying. This young lady who I originally had called on and got skipped over.  No, no, this one right here.  Yes.  Right here.  Im sorry, I love you, too, though.    Question: Good afternoon, Mr. President.  My name is Katrina King-Smith.  Im from the Turks and Caicos Islands.  My question is two-part, as well.  Firstly, in countries such as the Turks and Caicos Islands where the population is small and our main sources of revenue are tourism and foreign direct investment, I was wondering if you can suggest two ways that the government may better generate and regulate sustainable revenue, especially with regulations currently being put in place to close off-shore financial centers.  And secondly, I was wondering if after your term has ended, would you mind coming to the Turks and Caicos to vacation?    President Obama:  On the second question, absolutely. Ill do some island-hopping once Im out of office.  And you guys can show me all the good places to go.    On this issue of off-shore financial centers, we respect each country to set up its own financial regulations.  And we recognize that for small countries, that providing services -- including financial services -- may be an important source of revenue.  The one thing that we have to make sure of is that these financial centers are not either used for illicit money laundering or tax avoidance by large U.S. corporations that set up cut-outs or front organizations, but as a practical matter are operating in the United States, employing folks in the United States, essentially headquartered in the United States and yet, somehow, their mailing address is such-and-such island where they have to pay no taxes. Those are the kinds of egregious concerns that were trying to deal with.  I think we try to take it on a case-by-case basis.  And in my CARICOM meeting that I just had, this issue was brought up.  There were a number of leaders who expressed concern that maybe they were being unfairly labeled as areas of high financial risk.  And what I committed to them is we will examine their complaints and go through in very concrete ways where our concerns are and how our governments can work together. More broadly, I think that the -- if you look at some of the most successful countries in the world, theyre actually pretty small countries -- like Singapore, for example -- that on paper look like they have no assets, and yet, if you go to Singapore, it has one of the highest standards of living in the world.  What is it that Singapore did that might be replicable? Well, one of the most important things they did was they made an enormous investment in their people. And if youve got a highly skilled, highly educated workforce, if youve set up rules of law and governance that are transparent and non-corrupt, then you can attract actually a lot of service industries to supplement the tourist industry, because people would want to locate in your country.  You could envision people wanting to operate and have offices there where youve got a trained workforce.  And these days, so many businesses are operating over the Internet that if youve got a really skilled workforce that provides value added, you will attract companies and youll attract businesses. What deters people from investing in most countries is conflict, corruption, and a lack of skills or infrastructure.  And those countries that are able to address those problems have rule of law and eliminate corruption.  Make sure that you are investing in the education of your people and its a continuous education; it doesnt just stop at the lower grades, but you give people constant opportunities to upgrade their skills.  You have a decent infrastructure -- youre going to be able to succeed.  Thats the recipe, the formula for a 21st-century economy. All right.  Uh oh, theyre starting to holler at me. Lets see, I havent gone back here in a while.  This gentleman in the blue shirt right here.  Question:  Thanks so much, Mr. President.  We know that theres been an increasing military assertiveness of China, especially in the South China Sea.  And it seems that the U.S. has responded to that by pledging to increase its military presence because it recognizes the danger that that military increase of China poses to its friends and allies there.  Now, Chinas growing power isnt just military, its economic.  On this side of the world, China has used this soft power, this economic power especially to woo Caribbean governments.  My questions are, how does the U.S. view Chinas influence in its own backyard, especially since youve just talked about the Cold War and alliances?  And secondly, what plan does the U.S. have, if any, to contribute more to economic life in the Caribbean to ward off China in terms of foreign direct investment? Thank you very much, Mr. President.  President Obama:  Whats your name? Question:  Oh, sorry.  My name is Newton Harris from the University of Technology-Jamaica.  President Obama:  Fantastic.  Well, first of all, let me say that it is U.S. official policy and it is my strong belief that we should welcome Chinas peaceful rise.  What China has done in the last 20, 30 years is remarkable.  More people have been lifted out of poverty in a shorter period of time than perhaps any time in human history. And thats good for the world.  I mean, we should be more fearful of a poorer, collapsing China than a China that is participating in the world marketplace and trading and is getting along with its neighbors and part of the international order, because there are a really large number of Chinese people and we want them to be doing well. So our policy is not to fear Chinas peaceful rise.  Where we get concerned with China is where it is not necessarily abiding by international norms and rules, and is using its size and muscle to force countries into subordinate positions.  And that's the concern we have around maritime issues.  We think this can be solved diplomatically, but just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesnt mean that they can just be elbowed aside. And, by the way, we don't have a particular view on the territorial disputes, the maritime disputes.  Our attitude is simply, lets use the mechanisms that we have in place internationally to resolve them.  Now, with respect to Chinese investment in the Caribbean or in the Americas, in the Western Hemisphere, my response is the same one that I gave when I was asked this question in Africa, which is, if China is making investments that are building up infrastructure, or improving education, or helping the people, then we welcome that.  We think that's great.  The only thing is you got to make sure you look at what strings may be attached.  If the investments are made and it's solely to build a road to a mine to extract raw materials that are going to then be immediately going to a port and shipped to China, and if Chinese workers are shipped in to build the road -- and if you don't know exactly what the deal was with the government that led to China getting the contract -- in those situations, it may not be, in fact, serving the long-term interests of the country. Now, I would say -- by the way, I'd say the same thing about the United States.  So if we come in with an aid package to your country, and we say we got this great deal, we're going to give you $100 million for such and such, but if when you evaluate the actual benefits, it's U.S. companies that are disproportionately benefitting from it, and it's creating a situation where over the long term the United States is making a whole lot of profits but is not leaving behind a sustainable industrial base or ways in which that country can develop, then you have to evaluate that and try to get a better deal. So what I'm saying is not unique to China.  I think that's how all countries should be operating.  Your government should be transparent; it should be clear about what you're getting.  There should be an accounting of how the money flows. There should be a sense that over the long term, Jamaican businesses or somebody from Belize is getting a job, or -- right?  I mean, there should be some sense of how is this benefitting us over the long term.  And that's I think the only criteria that we're going to lay out. Now, last thing I'll say -- because you asked -- you kind of posed, is there like a bidding war going on here for affections.  The Chinese are giving us flowers and chocolates -- what are you doing for us lately? And so what I would say is this.  The United States, I think historically, has been an enormous provider of development aid.  Not always, by the way, has it followed the rule I just laid out in terms of whether or not the local recipients are benefitting, but I think we've gotten a lot better at that.  And if you look at institutions like the World Bank or other multilateral institutions, we remain the largest contributors by far.  So sometimes when you get money from a multilateral institution -- you look at whos doing what; if you look at what happens in terms of when Haiti gets decimated, whos raising the money -- we tend to look pretty good.  It turns out we're doing more than our fair share.  And we will continue to do that.  We do have some fiscal constraints.  And sometimes, I think -- when I travel to the Americas, to the region, people ask, why don't we have sort of the kinds of Alliance for Progress programs with huge sums of money.  Well, part of it is, is that right after World War II, the United States was so large relative to the rest of the world.  Japan was decimated; Europe was decimated.  Huge chunks of the world were behind the Iron Curtain.  And so it was natural that we gave fivefold or tenfold more than anybody else could do.  Well, things have evened out, in case you haven't noticed. We're still, by far, the most powerful nation on Earth and we still do more than everybody else, but we do expect others to step up and do their fair share.  But I can guarantee you this:  We will always do our fair share.  And nowhere is that truer than in the Caribbean and in the Americas, because you are our neighbors and some of our closest friends.  Lets see.  It's a young ladys turn.  This young lady right here.  Right here.  Question:  Welcome, Mr. President.  I lived a block away from you in Chicago when I went to the University of Chicago. President Obama:  Is that right? Question:  And my college sweetheart, Sam Kass, was your private chef until very recently.  President Obama:  Oh, wow! Well, you're just putting Sams business all out there. All right.  Whats your name? Question:  Lisandra Rickards.  I work for the Branson Centre of Entrepreneurship. President Obama:  Cassandra? Question:  Lisandra.  President Obama:  Lisandra.  All right.  Well, I'll tease Sam about this one.    Question:  Please do.    President Obama:  Everybody knows about you now.  Go ahead. Question:  My question is around immigration.  We've heard a lot about your immigration policy for undocumented immigrants who are currently living in the U.S.  But what about hopeful families that are seeking a legal pathway for immigration into the U.S. but are finding seven- to ten-year delays before they even can get to apply?  I'd love to hear you talk some more about your policy regarding shortening that timeline and making it less onerous on the applicants. President Obama:  Good.  That's a great question.  That's a great question. The United States is a nation of immigrants.  And this region has contributed to the remarkable progress that the United States has made over the last two centuries.  And my goal during the course of my presidency has been to make sure we continue to be a nation of immigrants as well as a nation of laws, and that we're attracting talent from all around the world.  Part of what makes us special is you walk in Brooklyn and there are folks from everywhere.  But theyre all striving, theyre all talented, theyre all trying to make their dreams come true.  And that is what gives us the energy and the strength to be able to accomplish everything we've accomplished.  So we need to fix what is, right now, a broken immigration system.  Part of it is dealing with those who are undocumented but who have been living there a long time, are part of the community, providing them with a pathway in which they have to earn a legal status, but recognizing that theyre there and we're not going to be separating out families.  That's not who we are.  That's not true to our values.  And ultimately, it's not good for our economy. But you are absolutely right that part of the reason that some people take the illegal route is because we make the legal route so difficult.  And so we're trying to identify ways to streamline that process. Now, I have to be honest.  A lot of people want to come to America.  So unless we just had no borders, theres always going to be a wait.  Theres always going to be background checks.  Theres always going to be some prioritization in terms of whos admitted and whos not.  But I do think that there are practices we have -- for example, where someone has a relation in the United States, is clearly qualified to become at some point a legal resident and maybe in the future a citizen, but in order to do it they have to first leave the country, wait, and now theyre separated from their families.  I mean, there have to be ways in which we can make the system clearer and less burdensome. Some of those changes we wanted to make were in the legislation that was proposed and passed the United States Senate.  I think there is still the opportunity to get that done before my presidency is over, but it does require the Republican Party I think to engage with me in a more serious effort, and to put aside the politics. Thank you very much for the question. All right, this side has been neglected right here.  I'm going to go with this guy with the beard, man, because he looks a little bit like -- he looks a little bit like Marshawn Lynch.    Question:  Greetings, Mr. President. President Obama:  How are you? Question:  More life and blessings on you and your family.  President Obama:  Whats your name? Question:  My name is Miguel Williams, but you can call -- I am Steppa. President Obama:  Steppa. Question:  Ya mon, that is quite sufficient.  My question has to do and surrounds U.S. policy as it regards the -- the legalization, the decriminalization of marijuana.  President Obama:  How did I anticipate this question?  Question:  Ya mon...Ya mon...Ya mon. President Obama:  How did I guess this question?  Question:  Yes.  And, Mr. President, it really comes on the foreground of -- we face economic challenges with the IMF, et cetera.  And and we find realistically that the hemp industry, the marijuana industry provides a highly feasible alternative to rise above poverty.  So I am wanting to over stand and to understand how U.S. is envisioning and how you would you see Jamaica pushing forward on a decriminalization, legalization emphasis on the hemp industry.    President Obama:  Okay.  Well. Let me -- I do want to separate out what are serious issues in the United States and then how that relates to our foreign policy and our interactions with the region.  There is the issue of legalization of marijuana, and then there is the issue of decriminalizing or dealing with the incarceration and, in some cases, devastation of communities as a consequence of nonviolent drug offenses.  I am a very strong believer that the path that we have taken in the United States in the so-called War on Drugs has been so heavy in emphasizing incarceration that it has been counterproductive.  You have young people who did not engage in violence who get very long penalties, get placed in prison, and then are rendered economically unemployable, are almost pushed into, then, the underground economy, learn crime more effectively in prison, families are devastated. So its been very unproductive.  And what were trying to do is to reform our criminal justice system.  And the good news is there has actually been some interest on the part of unlikely allies like the evangelical community or some otherwise very conservative Republicans, because its very expensive to incarcerate people, and a recognition that this may not be the best approach.  So thats one issue. Theres then the second issue of legalizing marijuana, whether its medical marijuana or recreational use.  There are two states in the United States that have embarked on an experiment to decriminalize or legalize marijuana -- Colorado and Washington State.  And we will see how that experiment works its way through the process.  Right now, that is not federal policy, and I do not foresee anytime soon Congress changing the law at a national basis.  But I do think that if there are states that show that they are not suddenly a magnet for additional crime, that they have a strong enough public health infrastructure to push against the potential of increased addiction, then its conceivable that that will spur on a national debate.  But that is going to be some time off. And then the third issue is what will U.S. international policy be.  And we had some discussion with the CARICOM countries about this.  I know on paper a lot of folks think, you know what, if we just legalize marijuana, then itll reduce the money flowing into the transnational drug trade, there are more revenues and jobs created.  I have to tell you that its not a silver bullet, because, first of all, if you are legalizing marijuana, then how do you deal with other drugs, and where do you draw the line?  Second of all, as is true in the global economy generally, if you have a bunch of small medium-sized marijuana businesses scattered across the Caribbean and this is suddenly legal, if you think that big multi-national companies are not going to suddenly come in and market and try to control and profit from the trade -- thats I think a very real scenario. And so I think we have to have a conversation about this, but our current policy continues to be that in the United States, we need to decrease demand.  We need to focus on a public health approach to decreasing demand.  We have to stop the flow of guns and cash into the Caribbean and Central America and Latin America. And at the same time, I think the Caribbean, Latin America have to -- Central America -- have to cooperate with us to try to shrink the power of the transnational drug organizations that are vicious and hugely destructive.  And if we combine a public health perspective, a focus on not simply throwing every low-level person with possession into prison by trying to get them treatment, if we combine that with economic development and alternative opportunities for youth, then I think we can strike the right balance.  It may not comport with your -- completely with your vision for the future, but I think that we could certainly have a smarter approach to it than we currently do. Got time for one more question.  One more question.  Lets see -- this is always hard.  Its always hard to be that last -- its a ladys turn, so all the guys just have to put down their hands.  Its too late for you.  Lets see.  You know what, Im just going to go with this young lady right here.  Shes just right in front.  Go ahead, yes, you.  Hold on a second, wait for the mic.    Question:  Afternoon, Mr. President.  Im Alana Williams [ph], Im from the South Side of Chicago. President Obama:  Wait, youre from Chicago? Question:  Yes! President Obama:  Well, what are you doing here?  This is supposed to be for Caribbean young ladies. Question:  Actually, I attend Olivet Nazarene University and Im studying abroad, so Im here.  President Obama:  I see, okay.  Well, youre cheating a little bit.  Ill have to call on somebody else after you. But Im going to go ahead and let you ask a question real quick.  Because Ill see you in Chicago.    Question:  Most definitely.  My question is really more so about home.  I love my city, but the violence is terrible, specifically amongst young black men.  And I know were talking a lot about police brutality, but Ive lost a lot of friends from people who look just like me.  And thats the problem.  And so I would like to know what you believe is the true source of the violence, and what is one solution to an extreme problem.  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, look, I know you asked it about Chicago but I know there are neighborhoods right here in Jamaica that have the same problems, and in every place all across the Caribbean; certainly in Central America.  I dont think there is just one single factor.  Obviously, a contributor is one that we just talked about, which is the drug trade.  If you have an illicit trade that generates huge amounts of money and is not regulated above board, that is going to attract ultimately people trying to carve out turf, trying to control markets, and violence ensues.  So thats point number one. Point number two is the easy accessibility of weapons.  And we were talking earlier about different traditions; the United States has a tradition of gun ownership that is deep; dates back to the pioneer past.  And I think it is a mistake that we do not do a better job of putting in place common-sense gun-safety regulations that would keep guns out of the hands of criminals, but unfortunately a majority of Congress does not agree with me.  Even after six-year-olds were gunned down viciously in their classroom, we could not get action done.  But what we are doing is cooperating with the region as we are cooperating with local jurisdictions to try to stem at least the flow of guns using the administrative tools that I have.  So thats number two. Number three is providing alternative paths for young people.  If a young person is reading by the age -- by the third grade and at grade level, if they are enjoying school, if they see a path for success, then they are less likely to get involved in criminal activity and that will reduce gun violence, and that will reduce crime, and that will reduce death. Which means investing in things like early childhood education and improving our schools -- those things are absolutely vital.  But there is a fourth element to this, and that is our own responsibility.  And particularly, as I speak to young people here today, we always talk about what can we do about the violence as if its like just separate and apart.  But we have control in our communities of our immediate friends, our immediate family.  We influence our peers.  And I do think that the power that all of you have as young leaders to be able to not make excuses for violence -- because there are a whole bunch of folks who have really tough backgrounds and come from terrible circumstances, and are really poor, but they dont go around shooting somebody.  They dont beat somebody over the head because of sneakers or because they looked at them the wrong way. And so there is an element of us retaking our communities and being willing to speak out against violence in our midst.  That doesnt ignore all the social factors.  But Dr. King used to say its not an either/or situation, its a both/and situation.  Government has to act.  We have to have effective policing, which means policing that is actually protecting as opposed to some of the things that weve been seeing of late in the United States, and Im sure is true in other countries.  And I say that saying that police have an extraordinarily difficult job, and the overwhelming majority do a great job under severe circumstances.  But theres got to be trust built between the communities, and I had to put a task force together that put together some excellent reports in the wake of Ferguson around how we can do that. But ultimately, what happens in the home, what happens in the school -- some of you are parents already; some of you will be parents -- what we teach our children in terms of values, valuing themselves, valuing others, thats important, too.  So theres no single solution.  But all of us have to do better.  Because the tragedy of what we see in the United States but also in cities and towns all across the Caribbean and Central America, is terrible.  And theres no excuse for it.  All right.  Because I called accidentally on a Chicagoan, Ive got to call on one more person.  Look, this young lady stood up, so she showed -- that wasnt fair, but I called on her, go ahead.  Youre not from Chicago are you?  Question:  No. President Obama:  You promise?  Okay.  All right, get the mic -- oh, Im sorry.  You know what, I confess, even though I was going to call on you, she thought she was going to be called on.  Im going to call on both of you now, but each of you get a really short question.  Really short, quick. Question:  Well, Im the team leader for the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and I want to thank you for the initiatives that youre planning to do here.  And I wanted to invite you to our annual general meeting thats going to be held in Babson in the States, so we want you to come because you are part of a global team.  So Im representing Jamaica as the youngest female team leader, and Im inviting you to come so we can talk about Startup America and we can collaborate on different projects.  So Im inviting you to come to that event. President Obama:  Okay, that was good.  And I can say Ill await your invitation.  And what I will say very quickly is entrepreneurship, small- and medium-sized businesses, that is a priority and that means that weve got to create channels for access to capital, technical training.  These are areas where a lot of our development aid is shifting.  Instead of just giving somebody a fish, we want to teach them how to fish. And what youre seeing -- what you see among young people all around the world is, is that instead of just finding a job in a big organization, they may want to create something of their own, a new vision.  And that kind of creativity has to be tapped.  So were shifting a lot of the work that we do around issues of entrepreneurship, so Ill be interested in seeing what you have to say.   All right.  This young lady right here, go ahead. Question:  Hello, everyone.  Hi, Mr. President.  My name is Davianne Tucker, and Im the Guild president-elect for the University of the West Indies. Thank you.  So my question is, the Jamaican government has been holding firmly to the stipulations of the IMF agreement.  There are many who would like to know if the debt write-offs for Jamaica are being considered as a means of improving the livelihood of our people.  So is that being considered? President Obama:  Well, this came up in my bilateral with your Prime Minister.  And, look, historically, I think there has been times where the IMF or the international multilateral organizations worked with governments in ways that werent always productive, got them deep into debt, and then suddenly youve got a lot more flowing out than was going in.  And in some cases there were governments around the world that were corrupt, lent money, money goes into a Swiss bank account, suddenly the people are paying off for decades. In Jamaica, some of it just had to do with tough circumstances, not always the best fiscal management.  I think that the current government has been wise to work hard to abide by the IMF provisions.  Thats not been easy.  And I think that has been the right thing to do.  But what I also agreed with, when I spoke to the Prime Minister, is the need to try to address in a more systematic fashion how we can spur growth and not just put the squeeze on folks.  Because what it turns out is, is that if a -- the best way for a country to reduce its debt is to grow really fast, and to generate more income.    Now, that does require development plans and approaches that are productive.  And it is true that sometimes that requires some short-term sacrifice.  And I think the question that the people of Jamaica, just like the people of the United States and everywhere else, should be asking is:  If the government is spending money right now, is it on something that is going to help create long-term growth and help people succeed?", "filename": "09April2015YoungLeadersTownHallinJamaica.txt"}, {"question": "Please have a seat. Over the past few weeks, Ive been talking about what I believe should be our number-one priority as a country -- building a better bargain for the middle class and for Americans who want to work their way into the middle class. At the same time, Im focused on my number-one responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, and that's keeping the American people safe. And in recent days, weve been reminded once again about the threats to our nation. As I said at the National Defense University back in May, in meeting those threats we have to strike the right balance between protecting our security and preserving our freedoms. And as part of this rebalancing, I called for a review of our surveillance programs. Unfortunately, rather than an orderly and lawful process to debate these issues and come up with appropriate reforms, repeated leaks of classified information have initiated the debate in a very passionate, but not always fully informed way. Now, keep in mind that as a senator, I expressed a healthy skepticism about these programs, and as President, Ive taken steps to make sure they have strong oversight by all three branches of government and clear safeguards to prevent abuse and protect the rights of the American people. But given the history of abuse by governments, its right to ask questions about surveillance -- particularly as technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives. Im also mindful of how these issues are viewed overseas, because American leadership around the world depends upon the example of American democracy and American openness -- because what makes us different from other countries is not simply our ability to secure our nation, its the way we do it -- with open debate and democratic process. In other words, its not enough for me, as President, to have confidence in these programs. The American people need to have confidence in them as well. And that's why, over the last few weeks, Ive consulted members of Congress who come at this issue from many different perspectives. Ive asked the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to review where our counterterrorism efforts and our values come into tension, and I directed my national security team to be more transparent and to pursue reforms of our laws and practices. And so, today, Id like to discuss four specific steps -- not all inclusive, but some specific steps that were going to be taking very shortly to move the debate forward. First, I will work with Congress to pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the Patriot Act -- the program that collects telephone records. As Ive said, this program is an important tool in our effort to disrupt terrorist plots. And it does not allow the government to listen to any phone calls without a warrant. But given the scale of this program, I understand the concerns of those who would worry that it could be subject to abuse. So after having a dialogue with members of Congress and civil libertarians, I believe that there are steps we can take to give the American people additional confidence that there are additional safeguards against abuse. For instance, we can take steps to put in place greater oversight, greater transparency, and constraints on the use of this authority. So I look forward to working with Congress to meet those objectives. Second, Ill work with Congress to improve the publics confidence in the oversight conducted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISC. The FISC was created by Congress to provide judicial review of certain intelligence activities so that a federal judge must find that our actions are consistent with the Constitution. However, to build greater confidence, I think we should consider some additional changes to the FISC. One of the concerns that people raise is that a judge reviewing a request from the government to conduct programmatic surveillance only hears one side of the story -- may tilt it too far in favor of security, may not pay enough attention to liberty. And while Ive got confidence in the court and I think theyve done a fine job, I think we can provide greater assurances that the court is looking at these issues from both perspectives -- security and privacy. So, specifically, we can take steps to make sure civil liberties concerns have an independent voice in appropriate cases by ensuring that the governments position is challenged by an adversary. Number three, we can, and must, be more transparent. So Ive directed the intelligence community to make public as much information about these programs as possible. Weve already declassified unprecedented information about the NSA, but we can go further. So at my direction, the Department of Justice will make public the legal rationale for the governments collection activities under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The NSA is taking steps to put in place a full-time civil liberties and privacy officer, and released information that details its mission, authorities, and oversight. And finally, the intelligence community is creating a website that will serve as a hub for further transparency, and this will give Americans and the world the ability to learn more about what our intelligence community does and what it doesnt do, how it carries out its mission, and why it does so. Fourth, were forming a high-level group of outside experts to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies. We need new thinking for a new era. We now have to unravel terrorist plots by finding a needle in the haystack of global telecommunications. And meanwhile, technology has given governments -- including our own -- unprecedented capability to monitor communications. So I am tasking this independent group to step back and review our capabilities -- particularly our surveillance technologies. And theyll consider how we can maintain the trust of the people, how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used, ask how surveillance impacts our foreign policy -- particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public. And they will provide an interim report in 60 days and a final report by the end of this year, so that we can move forward with a better understanding of how these programs impact our security, our privacy, and our foreign policy. So all these steps are designed to ensure that the American people can trust that our efforts are in line with our interests and our values. And to others around the world, I want to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people. Our intelligence is focused, above all, on finding the information thats necessary to protect our people, and -- in many cases -- protect our allies. Its true we have significant capabilities. Whats also true is we show a restraint that many governments around the world don't even think to do, refuse to show -- and that includes, by the way, some of Americas most vocal critics. We shouldnt forget the difference between the ability of our government to collect information online under strict guidelines and for narrow purposes, and the willingness of some other governments to throw their own citizens in prison for what they say online. And let me close with one additional thought. The men and women of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe because they love this country and believe in our values. They're patriots. And I believe that those who have lawfully raised their voices on behalf of privacy and civil liberties are also patriots who love our country and want it to live up to our highest ideals. So this is how were going to resolve our differences in the United States -- through vigorous public debate, guided by our Constitution, with reverence for our history as a nation of laws, and with respect for the facts. So, with that, Im going to take some questions. And lets see who weve got here. Were going to start with Julie Pace of AP. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about some of the foreign policy fallout from the disclosure of the NSA programs that you discussed. Your spokesman said yesterday that theres no question that the U.S. relationship with Russia has gotten worse since Vladimir Putin took office. How much of that decline do you attribute directly to Mr. Putin, given that you seem to have had a good working relationship with his predecessor? Also will there be any additional punitive measures taken against Russia for granting asylum to Edward Snowden? Or is canceling the September summit really all you can do given the host of issues the U.S. needs Russian cooperation for? Thank you. President Obama: Good. I think theres always been some tension in the U.S.-Russian relationship after the fall of the Soviet Union. Theres been cooperation in some areas; theres been competition in others. It is true that in my first four years, in working with President Medvedev, we made a lot of progress. We got START done -- or START II done. We were able to cooperate together on Iran sanctions. They provided us help in terms of supplying our troops in Afghanistan. We were able to get Russia into the WTO -- which is not just good for Russia, its good for our companies and businesses because they're more likely then to follow international norms and rules. So there's been a lot of good work that has been done and that is going to continue to be done. What's also true is, is that when President Putin -- who was prime minister when Medvedev was president -- came back into power I think we saw more rhetoric on the Russian side that was anti-American, that played into some of the old stereotypes about the Cold War contests between the United States and Russia. And I've encouraged Mr. Putin to think forward as opposed to backwards on those issues -- with mixed success. And I think the latest episode is just one more in a number of emerging differences that we've seen over the last several months around Syria, around human rights issues, where it is probably appropriate for us to take a pause, reassess where it is that Russia is going, what our core interests are, and calibrate the relationship so that we're doing things that are good for the United States and hopefully good for Russia as well, but recognizing that there just are going to be some differences and we're not going to be able to completely disguise them. And that's okay. Keep in mind that although I'm not attending the summit, I'll still be going to St. Petersburg because Russia is hosting the G20. That's important business in terms of our economy and our jobs and all the issues that are of concern to Americans. I know that one question that's been raised is how do we approach the Olympics. I want to just make very clear right now I do not think it's appropriate to boycott the Olympics. We've got a bunch of Americans out there who are training hard, who are doing everything they can to succeed. Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing in Russia. But as I said just this week, I've spoken out against that not just with respect to Russia but a number of other countries where we continue to do work with them, but we have a strong disagreement on this issue. And one of the things I'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we're seeing there. And if Russia doesn't have gay or lesbian athletes, then it probably makes their team weaker. Question: Are there going to be any additional punitive measures for Russia, beyond canceling the summit? President Obama: Keep in mind that our decision to not participate in the summit was not simply around Mr. Snowden. It had to do with the fact that, frankly, on a whole range of issues where we think we can make some progress, Russia has not moved. And so we don't consider that strictly punitive. We're going to assess where the relationship can advance U.S. interests and increase peace and stability and prosperity around the world. Where it can, were going to keep on working with them. Where we have differences, were going to say so clearly. And my hope is, is that over time, Mr. Putin and Russia recognize that rather than a zero-sum competition, in fact, if the two countries are working together we can probably advance the betterment of both peoples. Chuck Todd. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Given that you just announced a whole bunch of reforms based on essentially the leaks that Edward Snowden made on all of these surveillance programs, is that change -- is your mindset changed about him? Is he now more a whistle-blower than he is a hacker, as you called him at one point, or somebody that shouldnt be filed charges? And should he be provided more protection? Is he a patriot? You just used those words. And then just to follow up on the personal -- I want to follow up on a personal -- President Obama: Okay, I want to make sure -- everybody is asking one question it would be helpful. Question: No, I understand. It was a part of a question that you didnt answer. Can you get stuff done with Russia, big stuff done, without having a good personal relationship with Putin? President Obama: I dont have a bad personal relationship with Putin. When we have conversations, theyre candid, theyre blunt; oftentimes, theyre constructive. I know the press likes to focus on body language and hes got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom. But the truth is, is that when were in conversations together, oftentimes its very productive. So the issue here really has to do with where do they want to take Russia -- its substantive on a policy front. And -- Question: [Inaudible] President Obama: No. Right now, this is just a matter of where Mr. Putin and the Russian people want to go. I think if they are looking forward into the 21st century and how they can advance their economy, and make sure that some of our joint concerns around counterterrorism are managed effectively, then I think we can work together. If issues are framed as if the U.S. is for it then Russia should be against it, or were going to be finding ways where we can poke each other at every opportunity, then probably we dont get as much stuff done. See, now Ive forgotten your first question, which presumably was the more important one. No, I dont think Mr. Snowden was a patriot. As I said in my opening remarks, I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks. My preference -- and I think the American peoples preference -- would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws, a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place. Because I never made claims that all the surveillance technologies that have developed since the time some of these laws had been put in place somehow didn't require potentially some additional reforms. That's exactly what I called for. So the fact is, is that Mr. Snowden has been charged with three felonies. If, in fact, he believes that what he did was right, then, like every American citizen, he can come here, appear before the court with a lawyer and make his case. If the concern was that somehow this was the only way to get this information out to the public, I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistleblower protection to the intelligence community -- for the first time. So there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions. But having said that, once the leaks have happened, what weve seen is information come out in dribs and in drabs, sometimes coming out sideways. Once the information is out, the administration comes in, tries to correct the record. But by that time, its too late or weve moved on, and a general impression has, I think, taken hold not only among the American public but also around the world that somehow were out there willy-nilly just sucking in information on everybody and doing what we please with it. That's not the case. Our laws specifically prohibit us from surveilling U.S. persons without a warrant. And there are a whole range of safeguards that have been put in place to make sure that that basic principle is abided by. But what is clear is that whether, because of the instinctive bias of the intelligence community to keep everything very close -- and probably whats a fair criticism is my assumption that if we had checks and balances from the courts and Congress, that that traditional system of checks and balances would be enough to give people assurance that these programs were run probably -- that assumption I think proved to be undermined by what happened after the leaks. I think people have questions about this program. And so, as a consequence, I think it is important for us to go ahead and answer these questions. What Im going to be pushing the IC to do is rather than have a trunk come out here and leg come out there and a tail come out there, lets just put the whole elephant out there so people know exactly what they're looking at. Lets examine what is working, whats not, are there additional protections that can be put in place, and lets move forward. And theres no doubt that Mr. Snowdens leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through, and I had sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through. It would have been less exciting. It would not have generated as much press. I actually think we would have gotten to the same place, and we would have done so without putting at risk our national security and some very vital ways that we are able to get intelligence that we need to secure the country. Major Garrett. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Id like to ask you about this debate that's playing itself out in editorial pages, in the blogosphere, even in the Senate Democratic caucus, about the choice you eventually will make for the next Federal Reserve chairman. There is a perception among Democrats that Larry Summers has the inside track, and perhaps youve made some assurances to him about that. Janet Yellen is the vice chair of the Federal Reserve. There are many women in the Senate who are Democrats who believe that breaking the glass ceiling there would be historic and important. President Obama: Right. Question: Are you annoyed by this sort of roiling debate? Do you find it any way unseemly? And do you believe this will be one of the most important -- if not the most important -- economic decisions youll make in the remainder of your presidency? President Obama: It is definitely one of the most important economic decisions that Ill make in the remainder of my presidency. The Federal Reserve chairman is not just one of the most important economic policymakers in America, he or she is one of the most important policymakers in the world. And that person presumably will stay on after Im President. So this, along with Supreme Court appointments, is probably as important a decision as I make as President. I have a range of outstanding candidates. Youve mentioned two of them -- Mr. Summers and Mr. Yellen -- Ms. Yellen. And they're both terrific people. I think the perception that Mr. Summers might have an inside track simply had to do with a bunch of attacks that I was hearing on Mr. Summers preemptively, which is sort of a standard Washington exercise, that I don't like. Because when somebody has worked hard for me and worked hard on behalf of the American people, and I know the quality of those people, and I see them getting slapped around in the press for no reason -- before theyve even been nominated for anything -- then I want to make sure that somebody is standing up for them. I felt the same way when people were attacking Susan Rice before she was nominated for anything. So I tend to defend folks who I think have done a good job and don't deserve attacks. But I consider them both outstanding candidates. My main criteria -- Ive stated this before, but I want to repeat it -- my main criteria for the Fed Reserve chairman is somebody who understands theyve got a dual mandate. A critical part of the job is making sure that we keep inflation in check, that our monetary policy is sound, that the dollar is sound. Those are all critical components of the job. And weve seen what happens when the Fed is not paying attention. We saw, prior to Paul Volcker coming into place, inflation shooting up in ways that really damaged the real economy. But the other mandate is full employment. And right now, if you look at the biggest challenges we have, the challenge is not inflation; the challenge is weve still got too many people out of work, too many long-term unemployed, too much slack in the economy, and were not growing as fast as we should. And so I want a Fed chairman whos able to look at those issues and have a perspective that keeps an eye on inflation, makes sure that were not seeing artificial bubbles in place, but also recognizing, you know what, a big part of my job right now is to make sure the economy is growing quickly and robustly, and is sustained and durable, so that people who work hard in this country are able to find a job. And, frankly, I think both Larry Summers and Janet Yellen are highly qualified candidates. There are a couple of other candidates who are highly qualified as well. Ill make the decision in the fall. Question: Can you see how the perception of you defending Larry Summers as vigorously as you just did and in other quarters lead some to believe youve already made up your mind? President Obama: Well, except I just told you I havent. Major, Id defend you if somebody was saying something that wasnt true about you. I really would. In fact, Ive done that in the White House some times. Carol Lee. And, Carol, congratulations on Hudson. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama: Do you have pictures? Question: I do. Ill have to show you -- President Obama: Okay, Im going to have to see them. Question: I appreciate you making it a slow news week. I wanted to ask you about your evolution on the surveillance issues. I mean, part of what youre talking about today is restoring the public trust. And the public has seen you evolve from when you were in the U.S. Senate to now. And even as recently as June, you said that the process was such that people should be comfortable with it, and now youre saying youre making these reforms and people should be comfortable with those. So why should the public trust you on this issue, and why did you change your position multiple times? President Obama: Well, I think its important to say, Carol, first of all, I havent evolved in my assessment of the actual programs. I consistently have said that when I came into office I evaluated them. Some of these programs I had been critical of when I was in the Senate. When I looked through specifically what was being done, my determination was that the two programs in particular that had been at issue, 215 and 702, offered valuable intelligence that helps us protect the American people and they're worth preserving. What we also saw was that some bolts needed to be tightened up on some of the programs, so we initiated some additional oversight, reforms, compliance officers, audits and so forth. And if you look at the reports -- even the disclosures that Mr. Snowden has put forward -- all the stories that have been written, what you're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's emails. What you're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused. Now, part of the reason they're not abused is because these checks are in place, and those abuses would be against the law and would be against the orders of the FISC. Having said that, though, if you are outside of the intelligence community, if you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying, U.S.-Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, et cetera, well, understandably, people would be concerned. I would be, too, if I wasn't inside the government. And so in light of the changed environment where a whole set of questions have been raised, some in the most sensationalized manner possible, where these leaks are released drip by drip, one a week, to kind of maximize attention and see if they can catch us at some imprecision on something -- in light of that, it makes sense for us to go ahead, lay out what exactly we're doing, have a discussion with Congress, have a discussion with industry -- which is also impacted by this -- have a discussion with civil libertarians, and see can we do this better. I think the main thing I want to emphasize is I don't have an interest and the people at the NSA don't have an interest in doing anything other than making sure that where we can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, that we're able to carry out that critical task. We do not have an interest in doing anything other than that. And we've tried to set up a system that is as failsafe as so far at least we've been able to think of to make sure that these programs are not abused. But people may have better ideas and people may want to jigger slightly sort of the balance between the information that we can get versus the incremental encroachments on privacy that if haven't already taken place might take place in a future administration, or as technologies develop further. And the other thing thats happening is, is that as technology develops further, technology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So, for example, if people dont have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress are sufficient to give us confidence that government is not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological fixes that provide another layer of assurance. And so those are the kinds of things that Im looking forward to having a conversation about. Question: Can you understand, though, why some people might not trust what you're saying right now about wanting to -- President Obama: No, I cant. Question: -- that they should be comfortable with the process? President Obama: Well, the fact that I said that the programs are operating in a way that prevents abuse, that continues to be true, without the reforms. The question is how do I make the American people more comfortable. If I tell Michelle that I did the dishes -- now, granted, in the White House I dont do the dishes that much -- but back in the day -- and shes a little skeptical, well, Id like her to trust me, but maybe I need to bring her back and show her the dishes and not just have her take my word for it. And so the program is -- I am comfortable that the program currently is not being abused. Im comfortable that if the American people examined exactly what was taking place, how it was being used, what the safeguards were, that they would say, you know what, these folks are following the law and doing what they say theyre doing. But it is absolutely true that with the expansion of technology -- this is an area thats moving very quickly -- with the revelations that have depleted public trust, that if there are some additional things that we can do to build that trust back up, then we should do them. Jonathan Karl. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. You have said that core al Qaeda has been decimated, that its leaders are on the run. Now that weve seen this terror threat that has resulted in embassies closed throughout the Arab world, much of Africa, do you still believe that al Qaeda has been decimated? And if I can ask in the interest of transparency, can you tell us about these drone strikes that weve seen over the last couple of weeks in Yemen? President Obama: What I said in the same National Defense University speech back in May that I referred to earlier is that core al Qaeda is on its heels, has been decimated. But what I also said was that al Qaeda and other extremists have metastasized into regional groups that can pose significant dangers. And Id refer you back to that speech just back in May where I said specifically that although they are less likely to be able to carry out spectacular homeland attacks like 9/11, they have the capacity to go after our embassies. They have the capacity, potentially, to go after our businesses. They have the capacity to be destabilizing and disruptive in countries where the security apparatus is weak. And thats exactly what we are seeing right now. So its entirely consistent to say that this tightly organized and relatively centralized al Qaeda that attacked us on 9/11 has been broken apart and is very weak and does not have a lot of operational capacity, and to say we still have these regional organizations like AQAP that can pose a threat, that can drive potentially a truck bomb into an embassy wall and can kill some people. And so that requires us, then, to make sure that we have a strategy that is strengthening those partners so that theyve got their own capacity to deal with what are potentially manageable regional threats if these countries are a little bit stronger and have more effective CT and so forth. It means that weve got to continue to be vigilant and go after known terrorists who are potentially carrying out plots or are going to strengthen their capacity over time -- because theyre always testing the boundaries of, well, maybe we can try this, maybe we can do that. So this is a ongoing process. We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is to weaken it and to strengthen our partnerships in such a way that it does not pose the kind of horrible threat that we saw on 9/11. And Im not going to discuss specific operations that have taken place. Again, in my speech in May, I was very specific about how we make these determinations about potential lethal strikes, so I would refer you to that speech. Question: So you wont even confirm that we carried out drone strikes in Yemen? President Obama: I will not have a discussion about operational issues. Ed Henry. Question: I hope you would defend me as well. President Obama: I would. Question: Okay, thank you. I want to ask you about two important dates that are coming up. October 1st youve got to implement your signature health care law. You recently decided on your own to delay a key part of that. And I wonder, if you pick and choose what parts of the law to implement, couldnt your successor down the road pick and choose whether theyll implement your law and keep it in place? And on September 11th well have the first anniversary of Benghazi. And you said on September 12th, Make no mistake, well bring to justice the killers who attacked our people. Eleven months later, where are they, sir? President Obama: Well, I also said that wed get bin Laden, and I didnt get him in 11 months. So we have informed, I think, the public that theres a sealed indictment. Its sealed for a reason. But we are intent on capturing those who carried out this attack, and were going to stay on it until we get them. Question: And youre close to having suspects in custody? President Obama: I will leave it at that. But this remains a top priority for us. Anybody who attacks Americans, anybody who kills, tragically, four Americans who were serving us in a very dangerous place, were going to do everything we can to get those who carried out those attacks. With respect to health care, I didnt simply choose to delay this on my own. This was in consultation with businesses all across the country, many of whom are supportive of the Affordable Care Act, but -- and many of whom, by the way, are already providing health insurance to their employees but were concerned about the operational details of changing their HR operations, if theyve got a lot of employees, which could be costly for them, and them suggesting that there may be easier ways to do this. Now, whats true, Ed, is, is that in a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the Speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesnt go to the essence of the law -- it has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify the attestation of employers as to whether theyre already providing health insurance or not -- it looks like there may be some better ways to do this; let's make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do. But we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to \"Obamacare.\" We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation. Let me tell you what is the core of implementation that's already taken place. As we speak, right now, for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they are benefiting from being able to keep their kid on their plan if their kid is 26 or younger. That's benefiting millions of young people around the country, which is why lack of insurance among young people has actually gone down. That's in large part attributable to the steps that we've taken. You've got millions of people who have received rebates, because part of the Affordable Care Act was to say that if an insurance company isn't spending 80 percent of your premium on your health care, you get some money back. And, lo and behold, people have been getting their money back. It means that folks who have been bumping up with lifetime limits on their insurance, that it leaves them vulnerable. That doesn't exist. Seniors have been getting discounts on their prescription drugs. That's happening right now. Free preventive care -- mammograms, contraception. That's happening right now. I met a young man today on a bill signing I was doing with the student loan bill who came up to me and said thank you -- he couldn't have been more than 25, 26 years old -- thank you; I have cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act working with the California program, I was able to get health care and I'm now in remission. And so right now people are already benefiting. Now, what happens on October 1st, in 53 days, is for the remaining 15 percent of the population that doesnt have health insurance, they're going to be able to go on a website or call up a call center and sign up for affordable quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market. And if even with lower premiums they still can't afford it, we're going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it. And between October 1st into March there will be an open enrollment period in which millions of Americans for the first time are going to be able to get affordable health care. Now, I think the really interesting question is why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their number-one priority. The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits I just mentioned -- kids staying on their parents' plan; seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs; I guess a return to lifetime limits on insurance; people with preexisting conditions continuing to be blocked from being able to get health insurance. That's hard to understand as an agenda that is going to strengthen our middle class. At least they used to say, well, we're going to replace it with something better. Theres not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better. The notion is simply that those 30 million people, or the 150 million who are benefiting from the other aspects of Affordable Care, will be better off without it. That's their assertion -- not backed by fact, not backed by any evidence. Its just become an ideological fixation. Well, I tell you what, they're wrong about that. There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say, you know what, we should have thought of that earlier. Or this would work a little bit better. Or this needs an adjustment. That was true of Social Security. That was true of Medicare. That was true of the Childrens Health Insurance Program. That was true of the prescription drug program, Part D, that was rolled out by a Republican President and supported by Republicans who are still in the House of Representatives. That's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. Its true of Apple rolling out the new iPad. So you will be able to, whenever you want during the course of the next six months and probably the next year, find occasions where you say, ah-ha, you know what, that could have been done a little bit better. Or that thing, they're kind of making an administrative change; that's now how it was originally thought this thing was going to work. Yes, exactly. Because our goal is to actually deliver high-quality, affordable health care for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck. And I make no apologies for that. And let me just make one last point about this. The idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea. What you should be thinking about is how can we advance and improve ways for middle-class families to have some security so that if they work hard, they can get ahead and their kids can get ahead. Jessica Yellin. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. And following on what you just said, Republicans in the House might give you that choice soon to either allow the government to shut down or see Obamacare defunded. Would you choose to let the government shut down to ensure that Obamacare remains funded? President Obama: Well, Im not going to engage in hypotheticals. I can tell you that the American people would have difficulty understanding why we would weaken our economy, shut down our government, shut down vital services, have people who are not getting paid who then can't go to restaurants or shop for clothes, or all the other things that were doing here because Republicans have determined that they don't want to see these folks get health care. Again, they used to say they had a replacement. That never actually arrived, right? I mean, Ive been hearing about this whole replacement thing for two years -- now I just dont hear about it, because basically they dont have an agenda to provide health insurance to people at affordable rates. And the idea that you would shut down the government at a time when the recovery is getting some traction; where were growing, although not as fast as we need to; where the housing market is recovering, although not as fast as we would like; that we would precipitate another crisis here in Washington that no economist thinks is a good idea -- Im assuming that they will not take that path. I have confidence that common sense, in the end, will prevail. Question: And if they do, sir, you will have to make that choice? President Obama: Well see what happens. Weve got a couple of months. Question: Whens the last time you spoke to Speaker Boehner about the budget? President Obama: Fairly recently, yes. Probably right before they left. Okay. Scott Horseley. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Part of the political logic behind immigration reform was the strong showing by Latino voters last November. That doesnt seem to resonate with a lot of House Republicans who represent overwhelmingly white districts. What other political leverage can you bring to bear to help move a bill in the House?", "filename": "09August2013IntelligenceGatheringReformPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Over the past two days, American pilots and crews have served with courage and skill in the skies over Iraq. First, American forces have conducted targeted airstrikes against terrorist forces outside the city of Erbil to prevent them from advancing on the city and to protect our American diplomats and military personnel. So far, these strikes have successfully destroyed arms and equipment that ISIL terrorists could have used against Erbil. Meanwhile, Kurdish forces on the ground continue to defend the city, and the United States and the Iraqi government have stepped up our military assistance to Kurdish forces as they wage their fight. Second, our humanitarian effort continues to help the men, women and children stranded on Mount Sinjar.1 American forces have so far conducted two successful airdrops -- delivering thousands of meals and gallons of water to these desperate men, women and children. And American aircraft are positioned to strike ISIL terrorists around the mountain to help forces in Iraq break the siege and rescue those who are trapped there. Now, even as we deal with these immediate situations, we continue to pursue a broader strategy in Iraq. We will protect our American citizens in Iraq, whether theyre diplomats, civilians or military. If these terrorists threaten our facilities or our personnel, we will take action to protect our people. We will continue to provide military assistance and advice to the Iraqi government and Kurdish forces as they battle these terrorists, so that the terrorists cannot establish a permanent safe haven. We will continue to work with the international community to deal with the growing humanitarian crisis in Iraq. Even as our attention is focused on preventing an act of genocide and helping the men and women and children on the mountain, countless Iraqis have been driven or fled from their homes, including many Christians. This morning, I spoke with Prime Minister Cameron of the United Kingdom and President Hollande of France. Im pleased that both leaders expressed their strong support for our actions and have agreed to join us in providing humanitarian assistance to Iraqi civilians who are suffering so much. Once again, America is proud to act alongside our closest friends and allies. More broadly, the United Nations in Iraq is working urgently to help respond to the needs of those Iraqis fleeing from areas under threat. The U.N. Security Council has called on the international community to do everything it can to provide food, water and shelter. And in my calls with allies and partners around the world, Ill continue to urge them to join us in this humanitarian effort. Finally, we continue to call on Iraqis to come together and form the inclusive government that Iraq needs right now. Vice President Biden has been speaking to Iraqi leaders, and our team in Baghdad is in close touch with the Iraqi government. All Iraqi communities are ultimately threatened by these barbaric terrorists and all Iraqi communities need to unite to defend their country. Just as we are focused on the situation in the north affecting Kurds and Iraqi minorities, Sunnis and Shia in different parts of Iraq have suffered mightily at the hands of ISIL. Once an inclusive government is in place, Im confident it will be easier to mobilize all Iraqis against ISIL, and to mobilize greater support from our friends and allies. Ultimately, only Iraqis can ensure the security and stability of Iraq. The United States cant do it for them, but we can and will be partners in that effort. One final thing -- as we go forward, well continue to consult with Congress and coordinate closely with our allies and partners. And as Americans, we will continue to show gratitude to our men and women in uniform who are conducting our operations there. When called, they were ready -- as they always are. When given their mission, theyve performed with distinction -- as they always do. And when we see them serving with such honor and compassion, defending our fellow citizens and saving the lives of people theyve never met, it makes us proud to be Americans -- as we always will be. So with that, let me take a couple questions. Q: Mr. President, for how long a period of time do you see these airstrikes continuing for? And is your goal there to contain ISIS or to destroy it? THE PRESIDENT: Im not going to give a particular timetable, because as Ive said from the start, wherever and whenever U.S. personnel and facilities are threatened, its my obligation, my responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, to make sure that they are protected. And were not moving our embassy anytime soon. Were not moving our consulate anytime soon. And that means that, given the challenging security environment, were going to maintain vigilance and ensure that our people are safe. Our initial goal is to not only make sure Americans are protected, but also to deal with this humanitarian situation in Sinjar. We feel confident that we can prevent ISIL from going up a mountain and slaughtering the people who are there. But the next step, which is going to be complicated logistically, is how do we give safe passage for people down from the mountain, and where can we ultimately relocate them so that they are safe. Thats the kind of coordination that we need to do internationally. I was very pleased to get the cooperation of both Prime Minister Cameron and President Hollande in addressing some of the immediate needs in terms of airdrops and some of the assets and logistical support that theyre providing. But theres a broader set of questions that our experts now are engaged in with the United Nations and our allies and partners, and that is how do we potentially create a safe corridor or some other mechanism so that these people can move. That may take some time -- because there are varying estimates of how many people are up there, but theyre in the thousands, and moving them is not simple in this kind of security environment. Just to give people a sense, though, of a timetable -- that the most important timetable that Im focused on right now is the Iraqi government getting formed and finalized. Because in the absence of an Iraqi government, it is very hard to get a unified effort by Iraqis against ISIL. We can conduct airstrikes, but ultimately theres not going to be an American military solution to this problem. Theres going to have to be an Iraqi solution that America and other countries and allies support. And that cant happen effectively until you have a legitimate Iraqi government. So right now we have a president, we have a speaker. What we dont yet have is a prime minister and a cabinet that is formed that can go ahead and move forward, and then start reaching out to all the various groups and factions inside of Iraq, and can give confidence to populations in the Sunni areas that ISIL is not the only game in town. It also then allows us to take those Iraqi security forces that are able and functional, and they understand who theyre reporting to and what theyre fighting for, and what the chain of command is. And it provides a structure in which better cooperation is taking place between the Kurdish region and Baghdad. So were going to be pushing very hard to encourage Iraqis to get their government together. Until we do that, it is going to be hard to get the unity of effort that allows us to not just play defense, but also engage in some offense. Q: Mr. President, the United States has fought long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq with uncertain outcomes. How do you assure the American people that were not getting dragged into another war in Iraq? Have you underestimated the power of ISIS? And finally, you said that you involved international partners in humanitarian efforts. Is there any thought to talking to international partners as far as military actions to prevent the spread of ISIS? THE PRESIDENT: Well, a couple of things I would say. Number one, Ive been very clear that were not going to have U.S. combat troops in Iraq again. And we are going to maintain that, because we should have learned a lesson from our long and immensely costly incursion in Iraq. And that is that our military is so effective that we can keep a lid on problems wherever we are, if we put enough personnel and resources into it. But it can only last if the people in these countries themselves are able to arrive at the kinds of political accommodations and compromise that any civilized society requires. And so it would be, I think, a big mistake for us to think that we can, on the cheap, simply go in, tamp everything down again, restart without some fundamental shift in attitudes among the various Iraqi factions. Thats why it is so important to have an Iraqi government on the ground that is taking responsibility that we can help, that we can partner with, that has the capacity to get alliances in the region. And once thats in place, then I think we end up being one of many countries that can work together to deal with the broader crisis that ISIL poses. What were your other questions? Did we underestimate ISIL? I think that there is no doubt that their advance, their movement over the last several months has been more rapid than the intelligence estimates and I think the expectations of policymakers both in and outside of Iraq. And part of that is I think not a full appreciation of the degree to which the Iraqi security forces, when theyre far away from Baghdad, did not have the incentive or the capacity to hold ground against an aggressive adversary. And so thats one more reason why Iraqi government formation is so important -- because there has to be a rebuilding and an understanding of who it is that the Iraqi security forces are reporting to, what they are fighting for. And there has to be some investment by Sunnis in pushing back against ISIL. I think were already seeing -- and we will see even further -- the degree to which those territories under ISIL control alienated populations, because of the barbarity and brutality with which they operate. But in order to ensure that Sunni populations reject outright these kinds of incursions, theyve got to feel like theyre invested in a broader national government. And right now, they dont feel that. So the upshot is that what weve seen over the last several months indicates the weaknesses in an Iraqi government. But what weve also seen I think is a wake-up call for a lot of Iraqis inside of Baghdad recognizing that were going to have to rethink how we do business if were going to hold our country together. And, hopefully, that change in attitude supplemented by improved security efforts in which we can assist and help, that can make a difference. Q: You just expressed confidence that the Iraqi government can eventually prevent a safe haven. But youve also just described the complications with the Iraqi government and the sophistication of ISIL. So is it possible that what youve described and your ambitions there could take years, not months? THE PRESIDENT: I dont think were going to solve this problem in weeks, if thats what you mean. I think this is going to take some time. The Iraqi security forces, in order to mount an offensive and be able to operate effectively with the support of populations in Sunni areas, are going to have to revamp, get resupplied -- have a clearer strategy. Thats all going to be dependent on a government that the Iraqi people and the Iraqi military have confidence in. We can help in all those efforts. I think part of what were able to do right now is to preserve a space for them to do the hard work thats necessary. If they do that, the one thing that I also think has changed is that many of the Sunni countries in the region who have been generally suspicious or wary of the Iraqi government are more likely to join in, in the fight against ISIS, and that can be extremely helpful. But this is going to be a long-term project. Part of what weve seen is that a minority Sunni population in Iraq, as well as a majority Sunni population in Syria, has felt dissatisfied and detached and alienated from their respective governments. And that has been a ripe territory for these jihadists and extremists to operate. And rebuilding governance in those areas, and legitimacy for stable, moderate governing in those areas is going to take time. Now, there are some immediate concerns that we have to worry about. We have to make sure that ISIL is not engaging in the actions that could cripple a country permanently. Theres key infrastructure inside of Iraq that we have to be concerned about. My team has been vigilant, even before ISIL went into Mosul, about foreign fighters and jihadists gathering in Syria, and now in Iraq, who might potentially launch attacks outside the region against Western targets and U.S. targets. So theres going to be a counterterrorism element that we are already preparing for and have been working diligently on for a long time now. There is going to be a military element in protecting our people, but the long-term campaign of changing that environment so that the millions of Sunnis who live in these areas feel connected to and well-served by a national government, thats a long-term process. And thats something that the United States cannot do, only the Iraqi people themselves can do. We can help, we can advise, but we cant do it for them. And the U.S. military cannot do it for them. And so this goes back to the earlier question about U.S. military involvement. The nature of this problem is not one that a U.S. military can solve. We can assist and our military obviously can play an extraordinarily important role in bolstering efforts of an Iraqi partner as they make the right steps to keep their country together, but we cant do it for them. Last question. Q: America has spent 800 billion dollars in Iraq. Do you anticipate having to ask Congress for additional funds to support this mission? THE PRESIDENT: Currently, we are operating within the budget constraints that we already have. And well have to evaluate what happens over time. We already have a lot of assets in the region. We anticipate, when we make our preliminary budgets, that there may be things that come up requiring us to engage. And right now, at least, I think we are okay. If and when we need additional dollars to make sure that American personnel and American facilities are protected, then we will certainly make that request. But right now, thats not our primary concern. Last question. Q: Mr. President, do you have any second thoughts about pulling all ground troops out of Iraq? And does it give you pause as the U.S. -- is it doing the same thing in Afghanistan?", "filename": "09August2014UpdateonAirStrikesandHumanitarianAidinIraq.txt"}, {"question": "Before I get into the reason that Im here today, I want to begin by saying just a few words about the tragic events that weve watched unfold in France over the last several hours and days.  And because events have been fast-moving this morning, I wanted to make sure to comment on them. I just spoke to my counterterrorism advisor.  We have been in close touch with the French government throughout this tragedy.  The moment that the outrageous attack took place, we directed all of our law enforcement and counterintelligence operations to provide whatever support that our ally needs in confronting this challenge.  Were hopeful that the immediate threat is now resolved, thanks to the courage and professionalism of the French personnel on the ground.  But the French government continues to face the threat of terrorism and has to remain vigilant.  The situation is fluid.  President Hollande has made it clear that theyre going to do whatever is necessary to protect their people.  And I think its important for us to understand:  France is our oldest ally.  I want the people of France to know that the United States stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the families who have been directly impacted.  We grieve with you.  We fight alongside you to uphold our values, the values that we share -- universal values that bind us together as friends and as allies.  And in the streets of Paris, the world has seen once again what terrorists stand for.  They have nothing to offer but hatred and human suffering.  And we stand for freedom and hope and the dignity of all human beings.  And thats what the city of Paris represents to the world, and that spirit will endure forever -- long after the scourge of terrorism is banished from this world. Now, Im in Knoxville not only because I just like Knoxville, but Im here today because one of my resolutions is to make sure that folks across this great country feel like they are coming back.  And there is no doubt:  Thanks to the steps we took early on to rescue our economy and to rebuild it on a new foundation, America is coming back.  Now, Im not running for office anymore, so let me just present the facts.  I promised that 2014 would be a breakthrough year for America.  This morning, we got more evidence to back that up.  In December, our businesses created 240,000 new jobs.  Our unemployment rate fell to 5.6 percent, which is the lowest in six and a half years.  What that means is, 2014 was the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s.  Unemployment fell in 2014 faster than any year since 1984.  Now, think about that.  Its been 30 years since unemployment fell as fast as it did last year.  And most importantly, were seeing faster job growth in industries that provide good-paying jobs, traditionally middle-class jobs, than anything else.  Since 2010, the United States of America has create more jobs than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. American manufacturing is in its best stretch of job growth since the 1990s.  Were actually seeing companies insourcing instead of outsourcing.  Theyre realizing, we want to be here with American workers making American products.  America is now the worlds number-one producer in oil, gas.  Weve doubled the production of clean energy.  And, by the way, youre saving about a buck-ten a gallon at the pump over this time last year. Although I keep on reminding folks, gas prices, they go up and they come down and then they go up.  So I just want everybody to know that you should enjoy this.  Take the money youre saving, pay off the credit card or go get a new appliance, or buy a fuel-efficient car -- so that when prices go back up, youre still well-positioned. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance over the past year.  And, by the way, weve done this while cutting our deficits by about two-thirds.  Everybody thinks that -- they did a survey -- in every survey, they ask, is the deficit going up or going down?  And 70 percent of Americans say that the deficit is going up.  The deficit has come down by two-thirds since I took office. Meanwhile, thanks to the hard work of students and educators, dropout rates are down, graduation rates are up.  And after 13 long years, our war in Afghanistan has come to a responsible end, and weve got more troops that were home this holiday season. So I say all this because these six years have demanded a lot of hard work and a lot of sacrifice on everybodys part.  And as a country, weve got every right to be proud of what weve got to show for it.  Americas resurgence is real.  And now that weve seen calmer waters economically, if we all do our part, if we all pitch in, then we can start making sure that all boats are actually lifted again, and wages and incomes start rising again.  And we can make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers Americas prosperity just as it always has. So thats going to be the focus of my State of the Union address in a couple weeks.  I wanted to give you a little preview.  Dont tell anybody I said this.  Im giving you the inside scoop.  Thats going to be the essence of my message:  How do we build on the progress that weve made?  And I figured, why wait for the State of the Union?  Why stand on formalities; lets get the ball rolling right now. Two days ago, I visited Michigan, where workers have brought the auto industry roaring back.  And we talked about what else we can do around advanced manufacturing.  Yesterday, I was in Arizona, where I announced new actions to make the dream of homeownership a reality for more middle-class families.  Later today, Joe and I are going to head to a company in Clinton to take action that will develop high-tech industry even further here in Tennessee.  And right here, right now, at Pellissippi State, Im going to announce one of my most important State of the Union proposals, and thats helping every American afford a higher education. Now, part of the reason I wanted to come here was because Tennessee is at the forefront of doing some really smart stuff.  And weve got some proud Tennesseans who can take some credit for the great work thats been done.  First, your Governor, Bill Haslam, whos here.  Your two very fine senators, -- youve got Bob Corker -- and your senior Senator, Lamar Alexander, whos a former Secretary of Education himself, so he knows a little bit about this.  Youve got Congressman John Duncan.  Your Mayor, Madeline Rogero.  And we've got Pellissippis president, Anthony Wise. Hey!  And we've got all of you. Now, Joe and Jill both already touched on these themes, but let me just amplify them a little bit.  Here in America we don't guarantee equal outcomes.  Some folks work harder; some folks don't.  Some folks take advantage of opportunities; some folks don't.  Some people have good luck; some people have bad luck and things don't always work out where everything is perfectly equal.  But we do expect that everybody gets an equal shot.  We do expect everybody can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them.  We don't expect anybody to be bound by the circumstances of their birth.  If they were, I wouldn't be here, and neither would Joe.  Jill -- shes so accomplished she would have succeeded no matter what.  But we expect everybody to get a fair shot.  And in exchange, we do our fair share.  That's the basic bargain at the heart of this country:  If you work hard, you can get ahead.  It shouldnt matter what your last name is, or what we look like, or what family we were born into, or how we worship.  What matters is effort and merit.  That's the promise of America.  And the way we deliver on that is making sure that our education system works on behalf of every person who lives here.  America thrived in the 20th century in large part because we made high school the norm, and then we sent a generation to college on the GI Bill -- including my grandfather.  Then we dedicated ourselves to cultivating the most educated workforce in the world and we invested in whats one of the crown jewels of this country, and that's our higher education system.  And dating back to Abraham Lincoln, we invested in land-grant colleges.  We understood that this was a hallmark of America, this investment in education. But eventually, the world caught on and the world caught up.  And thats why we have to lead the world in education again.  Thats why my administration is working to make high-quality early childhood education available to all of our kids.  We know if we invest in them early, that it pays dividends on the backend. That's why we're working to bring high-speed broadband to 99 percent of Americas students within the next four years.  We want to make sure every child is plugged in.  That's why we're recruiting more highly trained math and science teachers.  That's why were working to raise standards and invest more in our elementary and middle and high schools, so that every young person is prepared for a competitive world.  And this work is not easy.  Sometimes it's controversial. It's not going to be the same in every state.  But in places like Tennessee, we're seeing incredible strides as a consequence of these efforts.  Over the past few years, Tennessee students have improved their reading scores and math scores more than any other state in the country.  Thats a credit to their hard work, their teachers hard work, to Governor Haslams hard work, leaders from both parties.  It's been a bipartisan effort.  Every Tennessean should be proud of that.  And today, in a 21st century economy, where your most valuable asset is your knowledge, the single most important way to get ahead is not just to get a high school education, youve got to get some higher education.  Thats why all of you are here. Now, the value of an education is not purely instrumental.  Education helps us be better people.  It helps us be better citizens.  You came to college to learn about the world and to engage with new ideas and to discover the things youre passionate about -- and maybe have a little fun.  And to expand your horizons.  Thats terrific -- thats a huge part of what college has to offer.  But youre also here, now more than ever, because a college degree is the surest ticket to the middle class.  It is the key to getting a good job that pays a good income -- and to provide you the security where even if you don't have the same job for 30 years, you're so adaptable and you have a skill set and the capacity to learn new skills, it ensures you're always employable. And that is the key not just for individual Americans, thats the key for this whole countrys ability to compete in the global economy.  In the new economy, jobs and businesses will go wherever the most skilled, best-educated workforce resides.  Because businesses are mobile now.  Technology means they can locate anywhere.  And where they have the most educated, most adaptable, most nimble workforce, that's where theyre going to locate.  And I want them to look no further than the United States of America.  I want them coming right here.  I want those businesses here, and I want the American people to be able to get those businesses -- or get those jobs that those businesses create.  So thats why weve increased grants and took on a student loan system that was funneling billions of taxpayer dollars through big banks, and said lets cut out the middleman, lets give them directly to students instead, we can help more students.  Weve increased scholarships.  We've cut taxes for people paying tuition.  We've let students cap their federal student loan payments at 10 percent of income so that they can borrow with confidence, particularly if you're going into a job like nursing or teaching that may not pay a huge salary but that's where your passions are.  Were creating a new college ratings system that will give parents and students the kind of clear, concise information you need to shop around for a school with the best value for you -- and gives us the capacity to recognize schools that offer a great education at a reasonable price.  On the flight over here, Lamar and I were talking about how we can do more to simplify the application process for federal student loans, which is still too complicated.  So we've done a lot of good work over the last six years; we're going to keep at it.  But today, I want to focus on a centerpiece of my education agenda -- and thats the community colleges, like this one.  For millions of Americans, community colleges are essential pathways to the middle class because theyre local, theyre flexible.  They work for people who work full-time.  They work for parents who have to raise kids full-time.  They work for folks who have gone as far as their skills will take them and want to earn new ones, but dont have the capacity to just suddenly go study for four years and not work.  Community colleges work for veterans transitioning back into civilian life.  Whether youre the first in your family to go to college, or coming back to school after many years away, community colleges find a place for you.  And you can get a great education.  Now, Jill has been teaching English at community colleges for 20 years.  She started when she was like 15.  And shes still full-time today.  And she sees -- I talk to her and she talks about her students, and she can see the excitement and the promise, and sometimes the fear of being a 32-year-old mom whos going back to school and never finished the degree that she had started, and life got in the way and now shes coming back and suddenly getting a whole new skills set and seeing a whole range of career options opening up to her.  Its exciting.  And thats what community colleges are all about -- the idea that no one with drive and discipline should be left out, should be locked out of opportunity, and certainly that nobody with that drive and discipline should be denied a college education just because they dont have the money.  Every American, whether theyre young or just young at heart, should be able to earn the skills and education necessary to compete and win in the 21st century economy. So today Im announcing an ambitious new plan to bring down the cost of community college tuition in America.  I want to bring it down to zero.  Were going to -- I want to make it free.  I want to make it free.  Community colleges should be free for those willing to work for it -- because in America, a quality education cannot be a privilege that is reserved for a few.  I think its a right for everybody whos willing to work for it. Now, the good news is, you already do something like this in Tennessee.  You call it Tennessee Promise.  So you call it Tennessee Promise, and we thought why not just build on what works.  So were going to call it Americas College Promise. And the concept is simple:  Americas College Promise will make two years of community college free to responsible students who are willing to work for it.  Now, I want to underscore that last clause -- everybody whos working hard for it.  There are no free rides in America.  You would have to earn it.  Students would have to do their part by keeping their grades up.  Colleges would have to do their part by offering high-quality academics and helping students actually graduate.  States would have to do their part too.  This isnt a blank check.  Its not a free lunch.  But for those willing to do the work, and for states and local communities that want to be a part of this, it can be a game-changer. Think about it:  Students who started at community colleges during those two years, and then go on to a four-year institution, they essentially get the first half of their bachelors degree for free.  People who enroll for skills training will graduate already ready to work, and they wont have a pile of student debt.  Two years of college will become as free and universal as high school is today.  Now, were also taking another page out of Tennessees playbook and making investments to expand technical training programs at community colleges, much like you do through your 27 Colleges of Applied Technology.   Joe did a terrific job running a task force that we put together just to look at the job training and technical training systems all around the country.  And at a time when jobs are changing, and higher wages call for higher skills, weve got to make sure workers have a chance to get those skills.  We want young people to graduate with real-world training that leads directly to good jobs, and we want older workers to get retrained so they can compete.  And we want more women and minorities to get jobs in fields that traditionally theyve been left out of, like science and technology, and engineering and math.  And we want to connect community colleges with employers, because when thats done right, these partnerships pay off for everybody:  Students learn on the job, employers get access to talent, colleges get help designing courses that actually prepare people for the workplace, all of which creates better pathways to todays middle class.  So were going to find the programs that work and were going to help them grow.  Now, in a few weeks, Im going to send to Congress my plan for free community college.  I hope that Congress will come together to support it, because opening the doors of higher education shouldnt be a Democratic issue or a Republican issue.  This is an American issue.    Governor Haslam is a Republican.  And thanks to his leadership, last year Democrats and Republicans came together and made Tennessee the first state in decades to offer free community college to its students.  Meanwhile, up in my hometown of Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is a Democrat, is now offering free community college, and theyre pairing students with growing sectors of the economy so they graduate with good jobs.  So if a state with Republican leadership is doing this and a city with Democratic leadership is doing this, then how about we all do it?  Lets do it for our future. And as I said before, there are a bunch of good bipartisan ideas out there.  A few days ago, Senator Alexander joined forces with a Democratic Senator, Michael Bennet, to introduce the legislation that would make financial aid forms simpler.  I noticed a lot of people applauded, because its been a while since I filled it out -- but I understand theres more than 100 questions on it.  It just shouldnt be that hard to apply for aid for college.  And so Ive committed to working with Senator Alexander.  Lets shrink it down.  Lets make life a little easier for millions of families.  The point is, were not going to agree on everything.  But simplifying that form, thats something we should be able to agree on.  Lets get that done this year. Because in the end, nothing is more important to our country than you, our people.  Thats our asset.  Weve got very nice real estate here.  Weve got this incredible bounty, the God-given resources that we enjoy in this country.  But our greatest resources are people.  And I want to say to the students here and the staff and faculty how proud I am of what you guys are doing.  A lot of students here, I know you had to overcome some obstacles to get here.  Many of you are the first in your families to go to college.  Some of you are working full time while youre going to school.  But youre making this investment in you, and by doing that, youre making an investment in this countrys future. And I just want to use one persons story as an example, Caitlin McLawhorn.

And she pressed the button and nodded her head.  Some things do not change -- even 50 years later. To all the members of Congress, the warriors for justice, the elected officials and community leaders who are here today -- I want to thank you. Four days into his sudden presidency -- and the night before he would address a joint session of the Congress in which he once served -- Lyndon Johnson sat around a table with his closest advisors, preparing his remarks to a shattered and grieving nation. He wanted to call on senators and representatives to pass a civil rights bill -- the most sweeping since Reconstruction.  And most of his staff counseled him against it.  They said it was hopeless; that it would anger powerful Southern Democrats and committee chairmen; that it risked derailing the rest of his domestic agenda.  And one particularly bold aide said he did not believe a President should spend his time and power on lost causes, however worthy they might be.  To which, it is said, President Johnson replied, Well, what the hells the presidency for?1  What the hells the presidency for if not to fight for causes you believe in?", "filename": "10April2014CivilRightsSummitKeynoteSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "It is hard to eulogize any man -- to capture in words not just the facts and the dates that make a life, but the essential truth of a person -- their private joys and sorrows; the quiet moments and unique qualities that illuminate someones soul.  How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice, and in the process moved billions around the world. Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by the elders of his Thembu tribe, Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century.  Like Gandhi, he would lead a resistance movement -- a movement that at its start had little prospect for success.  Like Dr. King, he would give potent voice to the claims of the oppressed and the moral necessity of racial justice.  He would endure a brutal imprisonment that began in the time of Kennedy and Khrushchev, and reached the final days of the Cold War.  Emerging from prison, without the force of arms, he would -- like Abraham Lincoln -- hold his country together when it threatened to break apart.  And like Americas Founding Fathers, he would erect a constitutional order to preserve freedom for future generations -- a commitment to democracy and rule of law ratified not only by his election, but by his willingness to step down from power after only one term. Given the sweep of his life, the scope of his accomplishments, the adoration that he so rightly earned, its tempting I think to remember Nelson Mandela as an icon, smiling and serene, detached from the tawdry affairs of lesser men.  But Madiba himself strongly resisted such a lifeless portrait.  Instead, Madiba insisted on sharing with us his doubts and his fears; his miscalculations along with his victories.  \"I am not a saint,\" he said, \"unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying.\" It was precisely because he could admit to imperfection -- because he could be so full of good humor, even mischief, despite the heavy burdens he carried -- that we loved him so.  He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood -- a son and a husband, a father and a friend.  And thats why we learned so much from him, and thats why we can learn from him still.  For nothing he achieved was inevitable.  In the arc of his life, we see a man who earned his place in history through struggle and shrewdness, and persistence and faith.  He tells us what is possible not just in the pages of history books, but in our own lives as well. Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals.  Perhaps Madiba was right that he inherited, \"a proud rebelliousness, a stubborn sense of fairness\" from his father.  And we know he shared with millions of black and colored South Africans the anger born of, \"a thousand slights, a thousand indignities, a thousand unremembered momentsa desire to fight the system that imprisoned my people,\" he said. But like other early giants of the ANC -- the Sisulus and Tambos -- Madiba disciplined his anger and channeled his desire to fight into organization, and platforms, and strategies for action, so men and women could stand up for their God-given dignity.  Moreover, he accepted the consequences of his actions, knowing that standing up to powerful interests and injustice carries a price: I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination.  Ive cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and [with] equal opportunities.  It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.  But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.1 Mandela taught us the power of action, but he also taught us the power of ideas; the importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those who you agree with, but also those who you dont agree with.  He understood that ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a snipers bullet.  He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate.  He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement.  And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his. Mandela demonstrated that action and ideas are not enough.  No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions.  He was practical, testing his beliefs against the hard surface of circumstance and history.  On core principles he was unyielding, which is why he could rebuff offers of unconditional release, reminding the Apartheid regime that \"prisoners cannot enter into contracts.\" But as he showed in painstaking negotiations to transfer power and draft new laws, he was not afraid to compromise for the sake of a larger goal.  And because he was not only a leader of a movement but a skillful politician, the Constitution that emerged was worthy of this multiracial democracy, true to his vision of laws that protect minority as well as majority rights, and the precious freedoms of every South African. And finally, Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit.  There is a word in South Africa -- Ubuntu -- a word that captures Mandelas greatest gift:  his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that are invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. We can never know how much of this sense was innate in him, or how much was shaped in a dark and solitary cell.  But we remember the gestures, large and small -- introducing his jailers as honored guests at his inauguration; taking a pitch in a Springbok uniform; turning his familys heartbreak into a call to confront HIV/AIDS -- that revealed the depth of his empathy and his understanding.  He not only embodied Ubuntu, he taught millions to find that truth within themselves. It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well -- to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth.  He changed laws, but he also changed hearts. For the people of South Africa, for those he inspired around the globe, Madibas passing is rightly a time of mourning, and a time to celebrate a heroic life.  But I believe it should also prompt in each of us a time for self-reflection.  With honesty, regardless of our station or our circumstance, we must ask:  How well have I applied his lessons in my own life?", "filename": "10December2013AddressatthePublicMemorialforNelsonMandela.txt"}, {"question": "Look at all of you.

Now how did they pull that off?", "filename": "10February2011NationalWirelessInitiativeAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Speaker, Mr. President, members of the General Assembly, my fellow Illinoisans:  Its actually kind of fun to start a speech like that twice in one month. What an incredible privilege it is to address this chamber. And to Governor Rauner, Senator Durbin, members of Congress, Speaker Madigan, Former Governor Pat Quinn, Mayor Langfelder and the people of Springfield -- thank you for such a warm welcome as I come back home.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  It's good to be home.  Thank you, guys. Thank you.  Thank you.  It is great to see so many old friends like John Cullerton and Emil Jones.  I miss you guys. It's great to be in the State Capitol.  Being here today calls to mind the first time I spoke on the Senate floor, almost 20 years ago.  And I was passionate, idealistic, ready to make a difference.  Just to stand in that magnificent chamber was enough to fill me up with a heightened sense of purpose. And I probably needed a little dose of reality when I first arrived.  So one day, I rose to speak about a bill.  And I thought Id made some compelling points, with irrefutable logic.  And I was about to sit down, feeling pretty good about myself, when Pate Philip sauntered over to my desk.  Now, there are some young people here, so for those of you who don't remember, Pate Philip was the Senate Majority Leader at the time. He was a Marine, and big shock of white hair, chomped on a cigar; was so politically incorrect that you don't even know how to describe it.  But he always treated me well.  And he came by and he slapped me on the back, he said, \"Kid, that was a pretty good speech.  In fact, I think you changed a lot of minds. But you didnt change any votes.\"  Then he singled, and they gaveled, and we got blown out. So that was my first lesson in humility.  The next came when I presented my own first bill.  It was a simple piece of legislation that would make it a lot easier for Illinois manufacturers to hire graduating community college students.  I didnt know any serious opposition, so I asked for a vote.  And what I got was a good hazing.  I assume that this custom still exists. So a senior colleague put the vote on hold to ask, \"Could you correctly pronounce your name for me?  Im having a little trouble with it.\"  \"Obama,\" I said.  \"Is that Irish?\" he asked.  And being in my early 30s at the time, I was a little cocky -- I said, \"It will be when I run countywide.\"  \"That was a good joke,\" he said, but he wasnt amused.  \"This bill is still going to die.\" And he went on to complain that my predecessors name was easier to pronounce than mine, that I didnt have cookies at my desk like she did, how would I ever expect to get any votes without having cookies on my desk.  \"I definitely urge a no vote,\" he said, \"whatever your name is.\" And for the next several minutes, the Senate debated on whether I should add an apostrophe to my name for the Irish, or whether the fact that \"Obama\" ends in a vowel meant I actually belonged to the Italians -- and just how many trees had had to die to print this terrible, miserable bill, anyway. And I was chastened.  And I said, \"If I survive this event, I will be eternally grateful and consider this a highlight of my legal and legislative career.\"  And I asked for a vote.  And initially the tote board showed that it was going down, but at the last minute it flipped and my bill passed.  But I was duly reminded that I was a freshman in the minority.  And I want to thank all my former colleagues in both chambers for not letting me forget it. To be a rookie in the minority party, as I was, is not much fun in any legislature.  We were called \"mushrooms\" -- because we were kept in the dark and fed a lot of manure.  But one benefit of being in such a position -- not being invited into the meetings where the big deals were being made -- is that I had a lot of time to get to know my colleagues.  And many of us were away from our families, and so we became friends. We went to fish fries together.  Wed go to union halls.  Wed play in golf scrambles.  We had a great bipartisan poker game at the Illinois Manufacturers Association.  Boro Relijie would host, and folks like Dave Luechtefeld and Terry Link, others would join in.  Wed eat downstairs -- and I cant say I miss the horseshoes.  But away from the glare of TV, or the tweets, or the GIFs of todays media, what we discovered was that despite our surface differences -- Democrats and Republicans, downstate hog farmers, inner-city African Americans, suburban businesspeople, Latinos from Pilsen or Little Village -- despite those differences, we actually had a lot in common.  We cared about our communities.  We cared about our families.  We cared about America. We fought hard for our positions.  I dont want to be nostalgic here -- we voted against each other all the time.  And party lines held most of the time.  But those relationships, that trust wed built meant that we came at each debate assuming the best in one another and not the worst. I was reminiscing with Christine Radogno -- we came in in the same class.  And we were on opposite sides of most issues, but I always trusted her and believed that she was a good person. And if we had a bill that we might be able to work together on, it was a pleasure to work with her on.  Or Dave Syverson, who -- we worked together on the Public Health and Welfare Committee, and we got some important work done that made a difference in peoples lives. And we didnt call each other idiots or fascists who were trying to destroy America.  Because then wed have to explain why we were playing poker or having a drink with an idiot or a fascist who was trying to destroy America. And that respect gave us room for progress.  And after Id served here for six years, my party finally gained the majority. Emil Jones became the President of the Senate.  And by then, I had made some friends across the aisle -- like Kirk Dillard, who I believe is here today, and we were able to pass the first serious ethics reform in 25 years.  And working closely with law enforcement, who knew by then that we cared about cops and sheriffs and prosecutors.  And working with folks like John Cullerton, we passed Illinois first racial profiling law, which was good for police officers and minority communities. And because someone like my friend, John Bouman, who worked at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, helped us build coalitions across the state, including with business, and was able to then reach out to Republicans, we were able to increase tax credits for the working poor and expand health insurance to children in need. And we wouldnt bend on our most deeply held principles, but we were willing to forge compromises in pursuit of a larger goal. We were practical when we needed to be.  We could fight like heck on one issue and then shake hands on the next.  Somebody like Jesse White was able to travel around the state and people didnt even know what party he was necessarily from because he brought so much joy with the tumblers and the work that they were doing. So I want you to know that this is why Ive always believed so deeply in a better kind of politics, in part because of what I learned here in this legislature.  Because of what I learned traveling across the state, visiting some of your districts, before I was running statewide, before I was a U.S. senator; learning all the corners of this state -- this most-representative of states.  A state of small towns and rich farmland, and the worlds greatest city.  A microcosm of America, where Democrats and Republicans and independents, and good people of every ethnicity and every faith shared certain bedrock values. I just saw a story the other day showing that if you rank all 50 states across categories like education levels and household incomes, and race and religion, the one state that most closely mirrors America as a whole is Illinois, this state. And I learned by talking to your constituents that if you were willing to listen, it was possible to bridge a lot of differences.  I learned that most Americans arent following the ins and outs of the legislature carefully, but they instinctively know that issues are more complicated than rehearsed sound bites; that they play differently in different parts of the state and in the country.  They understand the difference between realism and idealism; the difference between responsibility and recklessness. They had the maturity to know what can and cannot be compromised, and to admit the possibility that the other side just might have a point. And it convinced me that if we just approached our national politics the same way the American people approach their daily lives - at the workplace, at the Little League game; at church or the synagogue -- with common sense, and a commitment to fair play and basic courtesy, that there is no problem that we couldnt solve together. And that was the vision that guided me when I first ran for the United States Senate.  Thats the vision I shared when I said we are more than just a collection of red states and blue states, but we are the United States of America.  And that vision is why, nine years ago today, on the steps of the Old State Capitol just a few blocks from here, I announced my candidacy for President. Now, over these nine years, I want you to know my faith in the generosity and the fundamental goodness of the American people has been rewarded and affirmed over and over and over again.  Ive seen it in the determination of autoworkers who had been laid off but were sure that they could once again be part of a great, iconic Americans industry.  Ive seen it in the single mom who goes back to school even as shes working and looking after her kids because she wants a better life for that next generation.  Ive seen it the vision and risk-taking of small businessmen.  Ive seen it time and time again in the courage of our troops. But its been noted often by pundits that the tone of our politics hasnt gotten better since I was inaugurated, in fact its gotten worse; that theres still this yawning gap between the magnitude of our challenges and the smallness of our politics.  Which is why, in my final State of the Union address, and in the one before that, I had to acknowledge that one of my few regrets is my inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics.  I was able to be part of that here and yet couldnt translate it the way I wanted to into our politics in Washington. And people ask me why Ive devoted so much time to this topic.  And I tell them its not just because Im President, and the polarization and the gridlock are frustrating to me.  The fact is weve gotten a heck of a lot done these past seven years, despite the gridlock.  We saved the economy from a depression.  We brought back an auto industry from the brink of collapse.  We helped our businesses create 14 million new jobs over the past six years.  We cut the unemployment rate from 10 percent to 4.9 percent.  We covered nearly 18 million more Americans with health insurance.  We ignited a clean energy revolution.  We got bin Laden.  We brought the vast majority of our troops home to their families.  We got a lot done.  We're still getting a lot done. And our political system helped make these things possible, and the list could go on.  Theres no doubt America is better off today than when I took office.  I didn't want this to be a State of Union speech where we have the standing up and the sitting down.  Come on, guys, you know better than that.  No, no, no, Ive got a serious point to make here.  Ive got a serious point to make here because this is part of the issue, right?  We have an importation of our politics nationally, and on cable and talk radio, and it seeps into everything. The point Im trying to make is I care about fixing our politics not only because Im the President today, or because some of my initiatives have been blocked by Congress -- that happens to every President, happens to every governor, happens to everybody who participates -- anybody who participates in a democracy.  You're not going to get 100 percent of what you want all the time. The reason this is important to me is, next year Ill still hold the most important title of all, and that's the title of citizen.  And as an American citizen, I understand that our progress is not inevitable -- our progress has never been inevitable.  It must be fought for, and won by all of us, with the kind of patriotism that our fellow Illinoisan, Adlai Stevenson, once described not as a \"short, frenzied outburst of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.\"  It requires citizenship and a sense that we are one. And today that kind of citizenship is threatened by a poisonous political climate that pushes people away from participating in our public life.  It turns folks off.  It discourages them, makes them cynical.  And when that happens, more powerful and extreme voices fill the void.  When that happens, progress stalls.  And thats how we end up with only a handful of lobbyists setting the agenda.  Thats how we end up with policies that are detached from what working families face every day.  Thats how we end up with the well-connected who publicly demand that government stay out of their business but then whisper in its ear for special treatment. Thats how our political system gets consumed by small things when we are a people that are called to do great things -- to give everybody a shot in a changing economy; to keep America safe and strong in an uncertain world; to repair our climate before it threatens everything we leave for our kids. So thats whats on my mind as I come back to Illinois today.  This is what will be a focus of mine over the course of this year and beyond:  What can we do, all of us, together, to try to make our politics better?  And I speak to both sides on this.  As all of you know, it could be better, and all of you would feel prouder of the work you do if it was better. So, first, lets put to rest a couple of myths about our politics.  One is the myth that the problems with our politics are new.  They are not.  American politics has never been particularly gentle or high-minded -- especially not during times of great change. As I mentioned when I visited a mosque in Maryland last week, Thomas Jeffersons opponent tried to stir things up by suggesting he was a Muslim.  So Im in good company.  But thats nothing compared to the newspaper which warned that if Jefferson were elected, \"murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will be openly taught and practiced.\"  His Vice President, Aaron Burr, literally killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel.  I dont even want to tell you what Andrew Jacksons opponents said about his mamma.  Lincoln, himself, was routinely called \"weak, wishy-washy,\" a \"yahoo,\" \"an unshapely man,\" \"the obscene ape of Illinois,\" and, my favorite -- a \"facetious pettifogger.\"  I dont know what that means -- but it sounds insulting. So, comparatively speaking, today is not that bad -- as long as youve got a thick skin.  As Harold Washington once said:  \"Politics ain't beanbag.\"  Its tough.  And thats okay. Theres also the notion sometimes that our politics are broken because politicians are significantly more corrupt or beholden to big money than they used to be.  Theres no doubt that lobbyists still have easier access to the halls of power than the average American.  Theres a lot of work that we need to do to make sure that the system works for ordinary people and not just the well-connected.  Thats true at the federal level; thats true at the state level.  Folks arent entirely wrong when they feel as if the system too often is rigged and does not address their interests. But, relative to the past, listen, Im confident weve got enough rules and checks to prevent anyone in my Cabinet from siphoning whiskey tax revenue into their own pockets like President Grants administration did.  Until FDR went after the ward bosses of Tammany Hall, they controlled judges and politicians as they pleased -- patronage, bribery, and money laundering.  Its not as easy as it was to whip up tens of thousands of phantom votes, whether in Chicago or South Texas. From the Teapot Dome to Watergate, history tells us we should always be vigilant and demand that our public servants follow the highest ethical standards.  But the truth is that the kind of corruption that is blatant, of the sort that we saw in the past, is much less likely in todays politics.  And the Justice Department and the media work hard to keep it that way.  And thats a very good thing.  So we dont want to romanticize the past and think somehow its a difference in the people being elected. And it also isnt true that todays issues are inherently more polarizing than the past.  I remember, we endured four years of Civil War that resulted in hundreds of thousands of dead Americans.  This country was divided on a fundamental question. Before Pearl Harbor, entering into World War II was a highly charged debate.  The fault lines of Vietnam, the culture wars of the 60s -- they still echo into our politics a half-century later. Weve been arguing since our founding over the proper size and role of government; the meaning of individual freedom and equality; over war and peace, and the best way to give all of our citizens opportunity.  And these are important debates that everybody should join, with all the rigor that a free people require. My point is, the problem is not that politicians are worse, the problem is not that the issues are tougher.  And so its important for us to understand that the situation we find ourselves in today is not somehow unique or hopeless.  Weve always gone through periods when our democracy seems stuck.  And when that happens, we have to find a new way of doing business. Were in one of those moments.  Weve got to build a better politics -- one thats less of a spectacle and more of a battle of ideas; one thats less of a business and more of a mission; one that understands the success of the American experiment rests on our willingness to engage all our citizens in this work. And that starts by acknowledging that we do have a problem. And we all know it.  Whats different today is the nature and the extent of the polarization.  How ideologically divided the parties are is brought about by some of the same long-term trends in our politics and our culture.  The parties themselves have become more homogenous than ever.  A great sorting has taken place that drove Southern conservatives out of the Democratic Party, Northern moderates out of the Republican Party, so you dont have within each party as much diversity of views. And youve got a fractured media.  Some folks watch FOX News; some folks read the Huffington Post.  And very often, whats profitable is the most sensational conflict and the most incendiary sound bites.  And we can choose our own facts.  We dont have a common basis for whats true and whats not.  I mean, if I listened to some of these conservative pundits, I wouldnt vote for me either.  I sound like a scary guy. Youve got advocacy groups that, frankly, sometimes benefit from keeping their members agitated as much as possible, assured of the righteousness of their cause.  Unlimited dark money -- money that nobody knows where its coming from, whos paying -- drowns out ordinary voices.  And far too many of us surrender our voices entirely by choosing not to vote.  And this polarization is pervasive and it seeps into our society to the point where surveys even suggest that many Americans wouldnt want their kids to date someone from another political party.  Now, some of us dont want our kids dating, period.  But thats a losing battle. But this isnt just an abstract problem for political scientists.  This has real impact on whether or not we can get things done together.  This has a real impact on whether families are able to support themselves, or whether the homeless are getting shelter on a cold day.  It makes a difference as to the quality of the education that kids are getting.  This is not an abstraction. But so often, these debates, particularly in Washington but increasingly in state legislatures, become abstractions.  Its as if there are no people involved, its just cardboard cutouts and caricatures of positions.  It encourages the kind of ideological fealty that rejects any compromise as a form of weakness.  And in a big, complicated democracy like ours, if we cant compromise, by definition, we cant govern ourselves. Look, I am a progressive Democrat.  I am proud of that.  I make no bones about it.   Im going to make another point here.  I believe that people should have access to health care.  I believe they should have access to a good public education.  I believe that workers deserve a higher minimum wage. I believe that collective bargaining is critical to the prospects of the middle class, and that pensions are vital to retirement, as long as theyre funded responsibly. Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Sit down, Democrats.  Sit down.  Sit down -- just for a second.  I appreciate that, but I want to make this larger point. I believe were judged by how we care for the poor and the vulnerable.  I believe that in order to live up to our ideals, we have to continually fight discrimination in all its forms.   I believe in science, and the science behind things like climate change, and that a transition to cleaner sources of energy will help preserve the planet for future generations. I believe in a tough, smart foreign policy that says America will never hesitate to protect our people and our allies, but that we should use every element of our power and never rush to war. Those are the things I believe.  But heres the point I want to make.  I believe that there are a lot of Republicans who share many of these same values, even though they may disagree with me on the means to achieve them.  I think sometimes my Republican colleagues make constructive points about outdated regulations that may need to be changed, or programs that even though well-intended, didn't always work the way they were supposed to. And where Ive got an opportunity to find some common ground, that doesnt make me a sellout to my own party.  That applies -- well, well talk later, Duncan.  This is what happens, everybody starts cherry-picking.  One thing Ive learned is folks don't change. So trying to find common ground doesn't make me less of a Democrat or less of a progressive.  It means Im trying to get stuff done. And the same applies to a Republican who, heaven forbid, might agree with me on a particular issue -- or if I said America is great, decided to stand during a State of Union.  Its not a controversial proposition.  You're not going to get in trouble. But the fact that that's hard to do is a testament to how difficult our politics has become.  Because folks are worried, well, Im going to get yelled at by you, or this blogger is going to write that, or this talk show host is going to talk about me, and suddenly Ive got to challenger, and calling me a RINO or a not a real progressive. So when I hear voices in either party boast of their refusal to compromise as an accomplishment in and of itself, Im not impressed.  All that does is prevent what most Americans would consider actual accomplishments -- like fixing roads, educating kids, passing budgets, cleaning our environment, making our streets safe. It cuts both ways, guys.  See, suddenly everybody is standing.  This is fascinating to watch. The point is, it cuts both ways. Our Founders trusted us with the keys to this system of self-government.  Our politics is the place where we try to make this incredible machinery work; where we come together to settle our differences and solve big problems, do big things together that we could not possibly do alone.  And our Founders anchored all this in a visionary Constitution that separates power and demands compromise, precisely to prevent one party, or one wing of a party, or one faction, or some powerful interests from getting 100 percent of its way. So when either side makes blanket promises to their base that it cant possibly meet -- tax cuts without cuts to services -- \"everything will be fine, but we wont spend any money\" -- war without shared sacrifice -- \"were going to be tough, but dont worry, it will be fine\" -- union bashing or corporate bashing without acknowledging that both workers and businesses make our economy run -- that kind of politics means that the supporters will be perennially disappointed.  It only adds to folks sense that the system is rigged.  Its one of the reasons why we see these big electoral swings every few years.  Its why people are so cynical. Now, I dont pretend to have all the answers to this.  These trends will not change overnight.  If I did, I would have already done them through an executive action.  That was just a joke, guys.  Relax.   A sense of humor is also helpful. But I do want to offer some steps that we can take that I believe would help reform our institutions and move our system in a way that helps reflect our better selves.  And these arent particularly original, but I just want to go ahead and mention them. First is to take, or at least reduce, some of the corrosive influence of money in our politics. Now, this year, just over 150 families -- 150 families -- have spent as much on the presidential race as the rest of America combined.  Today, a couple of billionaires in one state can push their agenda, dump dark money into every state -- nobody knows where its coming from -- mostly used on these dark ads, everybody is kind of dark and the worst picture possible.  And theres some ominous voice talking about how theyre destroying the country. And they spend this money based on some ideological preference that really is disconnected to the realities of how people live.  Theyre not that concerned about the particulars of whats happening in a union hall in Galesburg, and what folks are going through trying to find a job.  Theyre not particularly familiar with whats happening at a VFW post.  [Phone rings.]  Somebodys phone is on. In Carbondale.  They havent heard personally from farmers outside of the Quads and what theyre going through.  Those are the voices that should be outweighing a handful of folks with a lot of money.  Im not saying the folks with a lot of money should have no voice; Im saying they shouldnt be able to drown out everybody elses. And thats why I disagree with the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision.  I dont believe that money is speech, or that political spending should have no limits, or that it shouldnt be disclosed.  I still support a constitutional amendment to set reasonable limits on financial influence in Americas elections. But amending the Constitution is an extremely challenging and time-consuming process -- as it should be.  So were going to have to come up with more immediate ways to reduce the influence of money in politics.  There are a lot of good proposals out there, and we have to work to find ones that can gain some bipartisan support -- because a handful of families and hidden interests shouldnt be able to bankroll elections in the greatest democracy on Earth. The second step towards a better politics is rethinking the way that we draw our congressional districts.  Now, let me point this out -- I want to point this out, because this is another case of cherry-picking here.  This tends to be popular in states where Democrats have been drawing the lines among Republicans, and less popular among Republicans where they control drawing the lines.  So lets be very clear here -- nobody has got clean hands on this thing. Nobody has got clean hands on this thing. The fact is, today technology allows parties in power to precision-draw constituencies so that the oppositions supporters are packed into as few districts as possible.  Thats why our districts are shaped like earmuffs or spaghetti.  Its also how one party can get more seats even when it gets fewer votes. And while this gerrymandering may insulate some incumbents from a serious challenge from the other party, it also means that the main thing those incumbents are worried about are challengers from the most extreme voices in their own party.  Thats whats happened in Congress.  You wonder why Congress doesnt work?  The House of Representatives there, there may be a handful -- less than 10 percent -- of districts that are even competitive at this point.  So if youre a Republican, all youre worried about is what somebody to your right is saying about you, because you know youre not going to lose a general election.  Same is true for a lot of Democrats.  So our debates move away from the middle, where most Americans are, towards the far ends of the spectrum.  And that polarizes us further. Now, this is something we have the power to fix.  And once the next census rolls around and we have the most up-to-date picture of Americas population, we should change the way our districts are drawn.  In America, politicians should not pick their voters; voters should pick their politicians.  And this needs to be done across the nation, not just in a select few states.  It should be done everywhere. Now, the more Americans use their voice and participate, the less captive our politics will be to narrow constituencies.  No matter how much undisclosed money is spent, no matter how many negative ads are run, no matter how unrepresentative a district is drawn, if everybody voted, if a far larger number of people voted, that would overcome in many ways some of these other institutional barriers.  It would make our politics better. And thats why a third step towards a better politics is making voting easier, not harder; and modernizing it for the way that we live now. Now, this shouldnt be controversial, guys.  You liked the redistricting thing, but not letting people vote.  I should get some applause on that, too. Listen, three years ago, I set up a bipartisan commission to improve the voting experience in America.  It had the election lawyers from my campaign and from Mitt Romneys campaign.  They got together outside of the context of immediate politics.  And I actually want to thank this assembly for moving to adopt some of its recommendations.  Thanks to the good work of my dear friend, Senator Don Harmon, and many of you, theres a new law going into effect this year that will allow Illinoisans to register and vote at the polls on Election Day.  It expands early voting -- something that makes it a lot easier for working folks and busy parents to go vote. Think about it.  If youre a single mom, and youve got to take public transportation to punch a clock, work round the clock, get home, cook dinner on a Tuesday in bad weather -- thats tough.  Why would we want to make it so that she couldnt do it on a Saturday or a Sunday?

But the question youre going to have to ask yourself when you caucus in January and you vote in November is, Whats next for America?", "filename": "10November2007SpeechattheJefferson-JacksonDinner.txt"}, {"question": "Over the past two years, what began as a series of peaceful protests against the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad has turned into a brutal civil war.  Over 100,000 people have been killed.  Millions have fled the country.  In that time, America has worked with allies to provide humanitarian support, to help the moderate opposition, and to shape a political settlement.  But I have resisted calls for military action, because we cannot resolve someone elses civil war through force, particularly after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. The situation profoundly changed, though, on August 21st, when Assads government gassed to death over a thousand people, including hundreds of children.  The images from this massacre are sickening:  Men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas.  Others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath.  A father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.  On that terrible night, the world saw in gruesome detail the terrible nature of chemical weapons, and why the overwhelming majority of humanity has declared them off-limits -- a crime against humanity, and a violation of the laws of war. This was not always the case.  In World War I, American GIs were among the many thousands killed by deadly gas in the trenches of Europe.  In World War II, the Nazis used gas to inflict the horror of the Holocaust.  Because these weapons can kill on a mass scale, with no distinction between soldier and infant, the civilized world has spent a century working to ban them.  And in 1997, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved an international agreement prohibiting the use of chemical weapons, now joined by 189 governments that represent 98 percent of humanity. On August 21st, these basic rules were violated, along with our sense of common humanity.  No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria.  The world saw thousands of videos, cell phone pictures, and social media accounts from the attack, and humanitarian organizations told stories of hospitals packed with people who had symptoms of poison gas. Moreover, we know the Assad regime was responsible.  In the days leading up to August 21st, we know that Assads chemical weapons personnel prepared for an attack near an area where they mix sarin gas.  They distributed gasmasks to their troops.  Then they fired rockets from a regime-controlled area into 11 neighborhoods that the regime has been trying to wipe clear of opposition forces.  Shortly after those rockets landed, the gas spread, and hospitals filled with the dying and the wounded.  We know senior figures in Assads military machine reviewed the results of the attack, and the regime increased their shelling of the same neighborhoods in the days that followed.  Weve also studied samples of blood and hair from people at the site that tested positive for sarin. When dictators commit atrocities, they depend upon the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory.  But these things happened.  The facts cannot be denied. The question now is what the United States of America, and the international community, is prepared to do about it.  Because what happened to those people -- to those children -- is not only a violation of international law, its also a danger to our security. Let me explain why.  If we fail to act, the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons.  As the ban against these weapons erodes, other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas, and using them.  Over time, our troops would again face the prospect of chemical warfare on the battlefield.  And it could be easier for terrorist organizations to obtain these weapons, and to use them to attack civilians.  If fighting spills beyond Syrias borders, these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan, and Israel.  And a failure to stand against the use of chemical weapons would weaken prohibitions against other weapons of mass destruction, and embolden Assads ally, Iran -- which must decide whether to ignore international law by building a nuclear weapon, or to take a more peaceful path. This is not a world we should accept.  This is whats at stake.  And that is why, after careful deliberation, I determined that it is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regimes use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike.  The purpose of this strike would be to deter Assad from using chemical weapons, to degrade his regimes ability to use them, and to make clear to the world that we will not tolerate their use.  That's my judgment as Commander-in-Chief.  But Im also the President of the worlds oldest constitutional democracy.  So even though I possess the authority to order military strikes, I believed it was right, in the absence of a direct or imminent threat to our security, to take this debate to Congress.  I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress.  And I believe that America acts more effectively abroad when we stand together.  This is especially true after a decade that put more and more war-making power in the hands of the President, and more and more burdens on the shoulders of our troops, while sidelining the peoples representatives from the critical decisions about when we use force. Now, I know that after the terrible toll of Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of any military action, no matter how limited, is not going to be popular.  After all, I've spent four and a half years working to end wars, not to start them.  Our troops are out of Iraq.  Our troops are coming home from Afghanistan.  And I know Americans want all of us in Washington -- especially me -- to concentrate on the task of building our nation here at home:  putting people back to work, educating our kids, growing our middle class. Its no wonder, then, that you're asking hard questions.  So let me answer some of the most important questions that I've heard from members of Congress, and that I've read in letters that you've sent to me. First, many of you have asked, wont this put us on a slippery slope to another war?  One man wrote to me that we are still recovering from our involvement in Iraq.  A veteran put it more bluntly:  This nation is sick and tired of war. My answer is simple:  I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.  I will not pursue an open-ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan.  I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo.  This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective:  deterring the use of chemical weapons, and degrading Assads capabilities. Others have asked whether it's worth acting if we dont take out Assad.  As some members of Congress have said, theres no point in simply doing a pinprick strike in Syria. Let me make something clear:  The United States military doesnt do pinpricks.  Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.  I don't think we should remove another dictator with force -- we learned from Iraq that doing so makes us responsible for all that comes next.  But a targeted strike can make Assad, or any other dictator, think twice before using chemical weapons. Other questions involve the dangers of retaliation.  We dont dismiss any threats, but the Assad regime does not have the ability to seriously threaten our military.  Any other retaliation they might seek is in line with threats that we face every day.  Neither Assad nor his allies have any interest in escalation that would lead to his demise.  And our ally, Israel, can defend itself with overwhelming force, as well as the unshakeable support of the United States of America. Many of you have asked a broader question:  Why should we get involved at all in a place that's so complicated, and where  -- as one person wrote to me -- those who come after Assad may be enemies of human rights? Its true that some of Assads opponents are extremists.  But al Qaeda will only draw strength in a more chaotic Syria if people there see the world doing nothing to prevent innocent civilians from being gassed to death.  The majority of the Syrian people -- and the Syrian opposition we work with -- just want to live in peace, with dignity and freedom.  And the day after any military action, we would redouble our efforts to achieve a political solution that strengthens those who reject the forces of tyranny and extremism. Finally, many of you have asked:  Why not leave this to other countries, or seek solutions short of force?  As several people wrote to me, We should not be the worlds policeman. I agree, and I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions.  Over the last two years, my administration has tried diplomacy and sanctions, warning and negotiations -- but chemical weapons were still used by the Assad regime. However, over the last few days, weve seen some encouraging signs.  In part because of the credible threat of U.S. military action, as well as constructive talks that I had with President Putin, the Russian government has indicated a willingness to join with the international community in pushing Assad to give up his chemical weapons.  The Assad regime has now admitted that it has these weapons, and even said theyd join the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits their use.  Its too early to tell whether this offer will succeed, and any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments.  But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force, particularly because Russia is one of Assads strongest allies. I have, therefore, asked the leaders of Congress to postpone a vote to authorize the use of force while we pursue this diplomatic path.  Im sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet his Russian counterpart on Thursday, and I will continue my own discussions with President Putin.  Ive spoken to the leaders of two of our closest allies, France and the United Kingdom, and we will work together in consultation with Russia and China to put forward a resolution at the U.N. Security Council requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons, and to ultimately destroy them under international control.  Well also give U.N. inspectors the opportunity to report their findings about what happened on August 21st.  And we will continue to rally support from allies from Europe to the Americas -- from Asia to the Middle East -- who agree on the need for action.  Meanwhile, Ive ordered our military to maintain their current posture to keep the pressure on Assad, and to be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.  And tonight, I give thanks again to our military and their families for their incredible strength and sacrifices. My fellow Americans, for nearly seven decades, the United States has been the anchor of global security.  This has meant doing more than forging international agreements -- it has meant enforcing them.  The burdens of leadership are often heavy, but the world is a better place because we have borne them.  And so, to my friends on the right, I ask you to reconcile your commitment to Americas military might with a failure to act when a cause is so plainly just.  To my friends on the left, I ask you to reconcile your belief in freedom and dignity for all people with those images of children writhing in pain, and going still on a cold hospital floor.  For sometimes resolutions and statements of condemnation are simply not enough. Indeed, Id ask every member of Congress, and those of you watching at home tonight, to view those videos of the attack, and then ask:  What kind of world will we live in if the United States of America sees a dictator brazenly violate international law with poison gas, and we choose to look the other way?", "filename": "10September2013SpeechtotheNationonSyria.txt"}, {"question": "This has been my third Summit of the Americas and my eighth visit to Latin America.  And my trip reflects, as I mentioned earlier, a new era of U.S. engagement in the region.  Over the past few days weve advanced our engagement across the board. In keeping with the Inter-American Democratic Charter, we continue to stand up strongly for democracy and human rights.  This was the first Summit of the Americas to include a formal role for civil society.  As I said at yesterdays forum, the United States will continue to deepen our support for civil society groups across the Americas and around the world.  Im pleased that there was widespread agreement among the nations here that civil society groups have a permanent role in future summits.  And the United States will support this work through the new innovation center were creating to empower civil society groups across Latin America.  How to promote greater opportunity for the Cuban people was also a major focus of my meeting with President Castro, the first between leaders of our two nations in more than half a century.  I told President Castro in private what Ive have said in public -- that our governments will continue to have differences and the United States will continue to stand firmly for universal values and human rights.  At the same time, we agreed that we can continue to take steps forward that advance our mutual interests. Well continue to work toward reestablishing diplomatic relations, reopening embassies in Havana and Washington, and encouraging greater contacts and commerce and exchanges between our citizens.  Im optimistic that well continue to make progress and that this can indeed be a turning point -- not just between the United States and Cuba, but for greater cooperation among countries across the region. Second, we continued our work to create more prosperity and opportunity for our people.  At our meeting yesterday, Central American leaders reaffirmed their commitment to pursue the good governance and economic and security reforms that are needed, and I reiterated my commitment to working with Congress to secure the $1 billion Ive proposed for our engagement with Central America. Yesterdays deal between Boeing and Copa Airlines will support jobs in the United States, in Panama, and across the region, and I think is representative of the commercial opportunities that allow both north and southern hemispheres -- both North and South America, as well as Central America to prosper if we deepen those trade ties. I was encouraged by the support of many leaders here for the WTO Trade Facilitation agreement, which would boost regional trade, and for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with its high standards for trade and strong protections for workers and the environment. Thanks to Panamas leadership, this summit included a special focus on how countries can expand access to education.  I want to thank our private sector partners who pledged to continue their support of our 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative to encourage more exchanges between our students.  The nearly $70 million in investments that Ive announced in Jamaica will expand education and training and employment programs for young people across Latin America and the Caribbean, including in impoverished and marginalized communities.  And the Young Leaders of the Americas initiative that I launched will help young entrepreneurs and civil society leaders across the entire region access the training and the resources and connections they need to start new ventures, including the small businesses that create so many jobs in the region. Finally, we took new steps to invest in clean energy and combat climate change.  The new fund I announced with our Caribbean and Central American partners will help mobilize private sector investment in clean energy projects and reduce carbon emissions across the region, and our new energy task force will identify additional steps we can take together.  A number of our countries committed to doubling our collective share of non-hydro renewable energy by 2030.  I reaffirmed that, through our $3 billion pledge to the Green Climate Fund, the United States will continue to help developing nations deal with the impacts of climate change.  And I reiterated our commitment to ensure that all countries in the hemisphere have open access to climate data as we meet this challenge together. So, continued progress on Cuba; new commitments to help lift up young people in the region; new partnerships to protect this beautiful land and our planet.  As I said this morning, the United States is more deeply engaged across the region than we have been in decades, and I believe the relationship between the United States and the Americas is as good as it has ever been.  Were focused on the future and what we can build and achieve together.  And our engagement with the countries and peoples of the Americas is going to continue throughout the remainder of my presidency.  So, with that, let me take some questions.  I'll start with Jim Kuhnhenn. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Sir, you head back to the United States with the task of convincing the American people and Congress on two major foreign policy initiatives -- the framework for a nuclear deal with Iran, and likely soon, the decision to remove Cuba from a list of state sponsors of terror.  Recent remarks by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini have raised doubts among some as to whether that deal can occur in Iran.  And Senator Schumer, an ally of yours, has -- wants Congress to have the right to vote on removal of sanctions.  Presidential politics are likely to play a part in this Cuba decision inevitably.  So Im wondering if it would take a lot of political capital just to get one done, let alone two.  Have you bitten off more than you can chew? President Obama:  No.  You may be surprised by that response, Jim.  Let me take them in turn. First of all, with respect to Cuba, there is majority support of our policy in the United States, and theres overwhelming support for our policy in Cuba.  I think people recognize that if you keep on doing something for 50 years and it doesnt work, you should try something new.  And so the American people dont need to be persuaded that this is, in fact, the right thing to do.  I recognize that there are still concerns and questions that Congress may have; weve got concerns and questions about specific activities that are taking place in Cuba, and human rights and reform.  And there were two members of the Cuban civil society that were in attendance at the meeting that I had yesterday who expressed much of what they have to go through on a day-to-day basis.  They were supportive of our policy of engagement with Cuba. And so I dont think that its so much we have to persuade anybody.  The issue of the State Sponsor of Terrorism list -- as you know, the State Department has provided a recommendation; its gone through our interagency process.  Ill be honest with you, I have been on the road, and I want to make sure that I have a chance to read it, study it, before we announce publicly what the policy outcome is going to be. But in terms of the overall direction of Cuba policy, I think there is a strong majority both in the United States and in Cuba that says our ability to engage, to open up commerce and travel and people-to-people exchanges is ultimately going to be good for the Cuban people. Now, with respect to Iran, I have always been clear:  We are not done yet.  What we were able to obtain was a political framework between the P5+1 nations and Iran that provided unprecedented verification of what is taking place in Iran over the next two decades that significantly cuts back on its centrifuges, that cuts of pathways for it to obtain a nuclear weapon, and that calls for, in return, the rolling back of sanctions in a phased way that allows us to snap back if Iran violates the agreement.  Thats the political framework.  That was not just something that the United States and Iran agreed to, but Iran agreed to a political framework with the other P5+1 nations. Now, whats always been clear is, is that Iran has its own politics around this issue.  They have their own hardliners.  They have their own countervailing impulses in terms of whether or not to go forward with something, just as we have in our country.  And so its not surprising to me that the Supreme Leader or a whole bunch of other people are going to try to characterize the deal in a way that protects their political position.  But I know what was discussed at -- in arriving at the political agreement.  What Ive always said, though, is that theres the possibility of backsliding.  Theres the possibility that it doesnt get memorialized in a way that satisfies us that were able to verify that, in fact, Iran is not getting a nuclear weapon, and that we are preserving the capacity to snap back sanctions in the event that they are breaking any deal. And thats why the work is going to be so important between now and the end of June to memorialize this so that we can all examine it.  And we dont have to speculate on what the meaning of a deal is going to be.  Either theres going to be a document that Iran agrees with the world community about and a series of actions that have to be taken, or theres not.  Part of the challenge in this whole process has been opponents of basically any deal with Iran have constantly tried to characterize what the deal is without seeing it.  Now, if we are able to obtain a final deal that comports with the political agreement -- and I say if because thats not yet final -- then Im absolutely positive that that is the best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.  And thats not my opinion; thats the opinion of people like Ernie Moniz, my Secretary of Energy, who is a physicist from MIT and actually knows something about this stuff.  Thats the opinion of a whole bunch of nuclear experts who examined the deal.  Very rarely do you see a consensus -- consensus is too strong a word -- a large majority of people who are experts in the field saying this is actually a realistic, plausible, meaningful approach to cut off the pathways for Iran getting a nuclear weapon, and that it is more likely to succeed not only than maintaining current sanctions or additional sanctions, but more likely to succeed than if we took a military approach to solving the problem. Again, thats not uniquely my opinion.  That is -- talk to people who are not affiliated with the administration, some of whom were skeptical about our capacity to get a deal done and have now looked at it and said if were able to actually get what was discussed in the political framework, its absolutely the right thing to do. Now, theres politics and political pressure inside of the United States.  We all know that.  The Prime Minister of Israel is deeply opposed to it.  I think hes made that very clear.  I have repeatedly asked, what is the alternative that you present that you think makes it less likely for Iran to get a nuclear weapon, and I have yet to obtain a good answer on that that.  And the narrow question thats going to be presented next week when Congress comes back is whats Congresss appropriate role in looking at a final deal.  And Ive talked to not only Bob Corker, but Ive talked to Ben Cardin, the Ranking Member on the Democratic side.  And I want to work with them so that Congress can look at this deal when its done.  What Im concerned about is making sure that we dont prejudge it, or those who are opposed to any deal whatsoever try to use a procedural argument essentially to screw up the possibility of a deal.  Last comment Im going to make on this.  When I hear some, like Senator McCain recently, suggest that our Secretary of State, John Kerry, who served in the United States Senate, a Vietnam veteran, whos provided exemplary service to this nation, is somehow less trustworthy in the interpretation of whats in a political agreement than the Supreme Leader of Iran -- thats an indication of the degree to which partisanship has crossed all boundaries.  And were seeing this again and again.  We saw it with the letter by the 47 senators who communicated directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran -- the person that they say cant be trusted at all -- warning him not to trust the United States government. We have Mitch McConnell trying to tell the world, oh, dont have confidence in the U.S. governments abilities to fulfill any climate change pledge that we might make.  And now we have a senator suggesting that our Secretary of State is purposely misinterpreting the deal and giving the Supreme Leader of Iran the benefit of the doubt in the interpretations.  Thats not how were supposed to run foreign policy, regardless of whos President or Secretary of State.  We can have arguments, and there are legitimate arguments to be had.  I understand why people might be mistrustful of Iran.  I understand why people might oppose the deal -- although the reason is not because this is a bad deal per se, but they just dont trust any deal with Iran, and may prefer to take a military approach to it. But when you start getting to the point where you are actively communicating that the United States government and our Secretary of State is somehow spinning presentations in a negotiation with a foreign power, particularly one that you say is your enemy, thats a problem.  It needs to stop. Jim Acosta.  Oh, Im sorry -- wheres Jim? Question:  Right here. President Obama:  There you are.  Question:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I was wondering if you were struck by Raul Castros warm words for you today.  He said he admired you; said he had read some of your autobiographies; described you as an honest man.  Im just curious what you thought about that.  And do you feel that Raul Castro is an honest man and can be trusted?  And I would be remiss if I didnt ask you about another Secretary of State -- Hillary Clinton -- who is expected to announce her campaign for the presidency tomorrow.  Do you foresee being involved in her campaign?  And do you hope that she runs on your record?  Thank you very much. President Obama:  It was a candid and fruitful conversation between me and Raul Castro.  I can tell you that, in the conversations Ive had so far with him -- two on the phone and, most recently, face-to-face -- that we are able to speak honestly about our differences and our concerns in ways that I think offer the possibility of moving the relationship between our two countries in a different and better direction. We have very different views of how society should be organized.  And I was very direct with him that we are not going to stop talking about issues like democracy and human rights and freedom of assembly and freedom of the press -- not because we think we are perfect and that every country has to mimic us exactly, but because there are a set of universal principles for which we stand. And one of the goals of my administration is to have some consistency in speaking out on behalf of those who oftentimes dont have a voice.  And I think during his speech in the plenary session, he was pretty clear about areas of U.S. policy he doesnt like, and I suspect hes going to continue to speak out on those. Whats been clear from this entire summit, though, is the unanimity with which, regardless of their ideological predispositions, the leaders of Latin America think this is the right thing to do.  Because what they see is the possibility of a more constructive dialogue that ultimately benefits the Cuban people, and removes what too often has been a distraction or an excuse from the hemisphere acting on important challenges that we face. So I am cautiously optimistic that over the coming months and coming years that the process that weve initiated, first announced in December, reaffirmed here at the Summit of the Americas, will lead to a different future for the Cuban people and a different relationship between the United States and Cuba. With respect to Hillary Clinton, Ill make my comments very brief.  She was a formidable candidate in 2008.  She was a great supporter of mine in the general election.  She was an outstanding Secretary of State.  She is my friend.  I think she would be an excellent President.  And Im not on the ballot.  So Im not going to step on her lines.  When she makes a decision to announce, Im confident that she will be very clear about her vision for the country moving forward, if she announces.  And in terms of her relationship with my administration, she was focused and working on really important foreign policy initiatives.  And the one thing I can say is that shes going to be able to handle herself very well in any conversations or debates around foreign policy.  And her track record with respect to domestic policy is I think one that cares about working families.  If she decides to run and she makes an announcement, shes going to have some strong messages to deliver. Jim Avila. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  First of all, on Cuba, if I could, two questions.  The Cuban government has frequently said that it cannot allow more political or personal freedoms, or press freedoms, because the United States has used both covert and otherwise actions to try to overthrow the Castros.  Does your new era, in fact, end regime-change efforts by the United States? And should the Cubans then respond by allowing free elections and tolerance of dissent now because of the changed policy?  And secondly, on the issue of Hillary Clinton, Vice President Biden, of course, said that the Democratic race is wide open.  The polls seem to say otherwise.  What is your opinion on that?  Is the race still wide open? President Obama:  Not only have I run my last election, but I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections.  That is your job.  (Laughter.)  And theres no shortage of people who are happy to opine on that.  I will not be one of them.  On Cuba, we are not in the business of regime change.  We are in the business of making sure the Cuban people have freedom and the ability to participate and shape their own destiny and their own lives, and supporting civil society.  And theres going to be an evolution, regardless of what we do, inside of Cuba.  Partly it's going to be generational.  If you listened to President Castros comments earlier this morning, a lot of the points he made referenced actions that took place before I was born, and part of my message here is the Cold War is over.  Theres still a whole lot of challenges that we face and a lot of issues around the world, and we're still going to have serious issues with Cuba on not just the Cuban governments approach to its own people, but also regional issues and concerns.  There are going to be areas where we cooperate as well.  Cuban doctors deployed during the Ebola crisis made a difference; Cuban activity in Haiti in the wake of the earthquake made a difference.  And so there may be areas of collaboration as well. What I said to President Castro is the same thing that I've said to leaders throughout the region.  We have a point of view and we won't be shy about expressing it.  But I'm confident that the way to lift up the values that we care about is through persuasion.  And that's going to be the primary approach that we take on a whole host of these issues -- primarily because they don't implicate our national security in a direct way.  And I think that we have to be very clear if Cuba is not a threat to the United States.  That doesnt mean we don't have differences with it.  But on the list of threats that I'm concerned about, I think it's fair to say that between ISIL and Iran getting a nuclear weapon, and activities in Yemen and Libya, and Boko Haram, Russian aggression in Ukraine and the impact on our allies there -- I could go down a pretty long list -- climate change -- so I think our approach has to be one of trying to work with the region and other countries, and be very clear about what we believe and what we stand for, and what we think works and what doesnt. And so often, when we insert ourselves in ways that go beyond persuasion, it's counterproductive.  It backfires.  That's been part of our history -- which is why countries keep on trying to use us as an excuse for their own governance failures.  Lets take away the excuse.  And lets be clear that we're prepared to partner and engage with everybody to try to lift up opportunity and prosperity and security for people in the region. Major Garrett. Question:  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Allow me, if you will, to correct -- to quote the Supreme Leader directly. President Obama:  Yes. Question:  The United States activity since the announcement of the framework has been deceptive, it is lying, it is devilish.  And on two particular points, he said -- direct quotes -- Irans military sites cannot be inspected under the excuse of nuclear supervision, and all sanctions should be removed when the deal is signed.  Is it your opinion, Mr. President, that this is pure posturing and it should be disregarded by your government and by you and your Secretary of State?  And if so, could you help me understand to whom the Supreme Leader would be posturing?  Because under my limited understanding of Iranian politics, that's not a job description usually applied to the Supreme Leader. President Obama:  That was a well-crafted question, Major.  And let me just suggest that even a guy with the title Supreme Leader has to be concerned about his own constituencies.  And the issue is not whether I have to take his word for whether that's his understanding -- because we've got work until the end of June to see if we've got a document that works.  And if that is his understanding and his position, in ways that can't be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isn't cheating under any program, and that we don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation, then we're probably not going to get a deal. So part of the concern that I have in this debate here, Major, is I don't understand why it is that everybody is working so hard to anticipate failure.  The opponents of the deal don't seem to be focused on how do we get to a good deal as much as theyre focused on how can we show that it's not possible to get a good deal.  And my simple point is lets wait and see what the deal is, and we'll be able to look.  And if, in fact, we're not satisfied that it cuts off the pathways for Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, then we won't sign it.  If, on the other hand, it does, then I will strongly argue, and I believe the American people will support and the international community will support, that its far preferable to the other alternatives. Now, Major, it's not going to be perfect, in the sense that if you asked Prime Minister Netanyahu or some members of the Republican caucus, or even some Democrats.  If you ask me, would I prefer that Iran never had, never did have, will never have even a single nut, bolt, anything related to nuclear power, don't have any nuclear scientists, don't have any capacity to develop it, that would be great.  But that's not possible.  That's not achievable.  That's not achievable through sanctions; it's not achievable through military means.  Theyre going to have some form of peaceful nuclear power, and that will then pose a challenge for the international community, which is why the political agreement calls for unprecedented framework of inspections that allows us to assure that its not being used or diverted in ways that could be weaponized.  But were going to have to see whether or not we can get a deal or not.  My only question is why we keep on trying to short-circuit the actual negotiations.  Nobody is -- were not disarming.  Were not getting rid of our nuclear weapons.  Were not getting rid of our Navy.  Were not giving anything up.  We are simply waiting to see what it is that the negotiators come up with.  And if, in fact, we are able to come up with something that works, then well know. And with respect to the Supreme Leader, yes, its a pretty important title.  It seems a little more clear-cut than President.  On the other hand, there may be ways of structuring a final deal that satisfy their pride, their optics, their politics, but meet our core practical objectives.  And thats what weve got to give the negotiators room to determine. Last question.  Karen DeYoung.  Wheres Karen?  There she is. Question:   Thank you.  Just to belabor the point on that question, Mr. President, your people have said that the framework agreement, that whats in it stands, that they are not renegotiable points, although the implementation of them can be renegotiated in some way.  And I wonder how, within that framework thats already been agreed, how we can come up with something that satisfies the kinds of concerns that he raised -- no inspection of military sites, immediate lifting of all sanctions the day that the thing is signed.  And also on Cuba, I wanted to ask, as you discussed the State Sponsor of Terrorism list with President Castro, the Cubans have raised some issues about the 45-day waiting period.  I wondered if that came up.  I know that your government is eager, assuming that the recommendation is approved -- is to remove it and is approved by you -- that we move ahead quickly with embassies.  The Cubans have raised concerns about that 45 days and how something could go wrong in those 45 days.  And it really doesnt give them access to the kinds of things they think they can have once theyre -- if and when theyre removed from the list.  Did that come up?  And is it your belief that once theyre removed from the list, then there is no impediment to go ahead with opening embassies, once you approve their removal from the list?", "filename": "11April2015PressConferenceFollowingSummitoftheAmericas.txt"}, {"question": "And I have to say -- please give Tolu another round of applause.  It takes a lot of courage to do what Tolu did -- to step out of the shadows, to share her story, and to hope that, despite the risks, she could make a difference.  But Tolu I think is representative of so many DREAMers out there who have worked so hard -- and I've had a chance to meet so many of them whove been willing to give a face to the undocumented and have inspired a movement across America.  And with each step, theyve reminded us -- time and again -- what this debate is all about.  This is not an abstract debate.  This is about incredible young people who understand themselves to be Americans, who have done everything right but have still been hampered in achieving their American Dream. And they remind us that we're a nation of immigrants.  Throughout our history, the promise we found in those who come from every corner of the globe has always been one of our greatest strengths.  Its kept our workforce vibrant and dynamic.  Its kept our businesses on the cutting edge.  Its helped build the greatest economic engine that the world has ever known.  When I speak to other world leaders, one of the biggest advantages we have economically is our demographics.  We're constantly replenishing ourselves with talent from across the globe.  No other country can match that history.  And what was true years ago is still true today -- whos beeping over there?  Youre feeling kind of self-conscious, arent you?  Its okay.  In recent years, one in four of Americas new small business owners were immigrants.  One in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants.  Forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by a first- or second-generation American. Think about that -- almost half of the Fortune 500 companies when they were started were started by first- or second-generation immigrants.  So immigration isnt just part of our national character.  It is a driving force in our economy that creates jobs and prosperity for all of our citizens. Now, heres the thing.  Over the past two decades, our immigration system hasnt kept pace with changing times and hasnt matched up with our most cherished values.  Right now, our immigration system invites the best and the brightest from all over the world to come and study at our top universities, and then once they finish -- once theyve gotten the training they need to build a new invention or create a new business -- our system too often tells them to go back home so that other countries can reap the benefits, the new jobs, the new businesses, the new industries.  Thats not smart.  But thats the broken system we have today.  Right now, our immigration system keeps families apart for years at a time.  Even for folks who, technically, under the legal immigration system, should be eligible to become citizens but it is so long and so cumbersome, so byzantine, that families end up being separated for years.  Because of a backlog in visas, people who come here legally -- who are ready to give it their all to earn their place in America -- end up waiting for years to join their loved ones here in the United States.  Its not right. But thats the broken system we have today.  Right now, our immigration system has no credible way of dealing with the 11 million men and women who are in this country illegally.  And, yes, they broke the rules; they didnt wait their turn.  They shouldnt be let off easy.  They shouldnt be allowed to game the system.  But at the same time, the vast majority of these individuals arent looking for any trouble.  Theyre just looking to provide for their families, contribute to their communities.  Theyre our neighbors.  We know their kids.  Too often, theyre forced to do what they do in a shadow economy where shady employers can exploit them by paying less than the minimum wage, making them work without overtime, not giving them any benefits. That pushes down standards for all workers.  Its bad for everybody.  Because all the businesses that do play by the rules, that hire people legally, that pay them fairly -- theyre at a competitive disadvantage.  American workers end up being at a competitive disadvantage.  Its not fair.  But thats the broken system that we have today. Now, over the past four years, weve tried to patch up some of the worst cracks in the system.  We made border security a top priority.  Today, we have twice as many border patrol agents as we did in 2004.  We have more boots on the ground along our southern border than at any time in our history.  And in part, by using technology more effectively, illegal crossings are near their lowest level in decades.     We focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who are endangering our communities.  And today, deportation of criminals is at its highest level ever. And having put border security in place, having refocused on those who could do our communities harm, we also then took up the cause of the DREAMers, young people like Tolu who were brought to this country as children.  We said that if youre able to meet some basic criteria, like pursuing a higher education, then well consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so you can continue to work here, and study here, and contribute to our communities legally. So my administration has done what we can on our own.  And weve got members of my administration here whove done outstanding work over the past few years to try to close up some of the gaps that exist in the system.  But the system is still broken.  And to truly deal with this issue, Congress needs to act.  And that moment is now.  This week, the Senate will consider a common-sense, bipartisan bill that is the best chance weve had in years to fix our broken immigration system.  It will build on what weve done and continue to strengthen our borders.  It will make sure that businesses and workers are all playing by the same set of rules, and it includes tough penalties for those who dont.  Its fair for middle-class families, by making sure that those who are brought into the system pay their fair share in taxes and for services.  And its fair for those who try to immigrate legally by stopping those who try to skip the line.  Its the right thing to do. Now, this bill isnt perfect.  Its a compromise.  And going forward, nobody is going to get everything that they want -- not Democrats, not Republicans, not me.  But this is a bill thats largely consistent with the principles that I and the people on this stage have laid out for common-sense reform.  First of all, if passed, this bill would be the biggest commitment to border security in our nations history.  It would put another $6.5 billion -- on top of what were already spending -- towards stronger, smarter security along our borders.  It would increase criminal penalties against smugglers and traffickers.  It would finally give every employer a reliable way to check that every person theyre hiring is here legally.  And it would hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers.  So it strengthens border security, but also enforcement within our borders. I know theres a lot of talk right now about border security, so let me repeat -- today, illegal crossings are near their lowest level in decades.  And if passed, the Senate bill as currently written and as hitting the floor would put in place the toughest border enforcement plan that America has ever seen.  So nobody is taking border enforcement lightly.  Thats part of this bill.    Number two, this bill would provide a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are in this country illegally.  So that pathway is arduous.  You've got to pass background checks.  You've got to learn English.  You've got to pay taxes and a penalty.  And then you've got to go to the back of the line behind everybody whos done things the right way and have tried to come here legally. So this wont be a quick process.  It will take at least 13 years before the vast majority of these individuals are able to even apply for citizenship.  So this is no cakewalk.  But its the only way we can make sure that everyone whos here is playing by the same rules as ordinary families -- paying taxes and getting their own health insurance.  Thats why, for immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship.  If were asking everybody to play by the same rules, you got to give people a sense of certainty that they go through all these sacrifices, do all this, that theres at the end of the horizon, the opportunity -- not the guarantee, but the opportunity -- to be part of this American family.  And by the way, a majority of Americans support this idea. Number three, this bill would modernize the legal immigration system so that, alongside training American workers for the jobs of tomorrow, were also attracting the highly skilled entrepreneurs and engineers from around the world who will ultimately grow our economy.  And this bill would help make sure that our people dont have to wait years before their loved ones are able to join them here in America. So thats what immigration reform looks like:  Smarter enforcement; a pathway to earned citizenship; improvements to our legal system.  Theyre all common-sense steps.  Theyve got bipartisan support.  Theyve got the support of a broad cross-section of leaders from every walk of life.  So theres no reason Congress cant get this done by the end of the summer.  Remember, the process that led to this bill was open and inclusive.  For months, the bipartisan Gang of Eight looked at every issue, reconciled competing ideas, built a compromise that works.  Then the Judiciary Committee held numerous hearings.  More than a hundred amendments were added, often with bipartisan support.  The good news is every day that goes by, more and more Republicans and Democrats are coming out to support this common-sense immigration reform bill. And Im sure the bill will go through a few more changes in the weeks to come.  But this much is clear:  If you genuinely believe we need to fix our broken immigration system, theres no good reason to stand in the way of this bill.  A lot of people -- Democrats and Republicans -- have done a lot of good work on this bill.  So if youre serious about actually fixing the system, then this is the vehicle to do it.  If youre not serious about it, if you think that a broken system is the best America can do, then I guess it might make sense to try to block it.  But if you're actually serious and sincere about fixing a broken system, this is the vehicle to do it.  And now is the time to get it done.  There is no good reason to play procedural games or engage in obstruction just to block the best chance weve had in years to address this problem in a way thats fair to middle-class families, to business owners, to legal immigrants.  And theres no good reason to undo the progress weve already made -- especially when it comes to extreme steps like stripping protections from DREAMers that my administration has provided, or asking law enforcement to treat them the same way they treat violent criminals.  Thats not who we are.  We owe it to America to do better.  We owe it to the DREAMers to do better.  We owe it to the young people like Tolu and Diego Sanchez, whos with us here today.  Where's Diego?  Right here.  Diego came here from Argentina with his parents when he was just a kid, and growing up, America was his home.  This is where he went to school.  This is where he made friends.  This is where he built a life.  You ask Diego and hell tell you he feels American in every way -- except one; on paper.    In high school, Diego found out that he was undocumented.  Think about that.  With all the stuff you're already dealing with in high school -- and suddenly, oh, man, really?  So he had done everything right -- stayed out of trouble, excelled in class, contributed to his community -- feeling hopeful about his future, and suddenly he finds out he's got to live in fear of deportation. Watching his friends get their licenses knowing he couldnt get one himself.  Seeing his classmates apply for summer jobs knowing he couldnt do that either.  When Diego heard that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows, he went and signed up. All he wanted, he said, was a chance to, live a normal life and to contribute to the country I love.  And Diego, this year, was approved for deferred action.  A few weeks ago, he graduated from St. Thomas University, where he was student body president and Student of the Year. So now hes set his sights higher -- master's degree and then law school so he can pursue a career in public policy, help America shape its future.  Why wouldnt we want to do the right thing by Diego?  What rationale is there out there that wouldnt want to make sure Diego achieves his dreams?", "filename": "11June2013USSenateCalltoComprehensiveImmigrationReform.txt"}, {"question": "President, you're very nice to be here with us today.

It is very exciting for us to have you here for a face-to-face conversation with U.S. service members.  Were very, very pleased to have you. President Obama:  Well, Nathan, thank you so much for your participation.  I want to thank everybody whos here in Fort Meade.  There are a couple of people I want to acknowledge. First of all, your Garrison Commander, Colonel Brian Foley.  Where is he?  I just rode over with him.  There he is.  Hes in charge of a lot of stuff.  I was -- with everything thats going on out of this incredible facility.  Obviously we cant succeed in our missions without a strong support from Congress, and weve got a congressman here who works very hard on behalf of our military and our intelligence -- Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger.  Wheres Dutch?  There he is.  Thank you so much, Dutch. Im going to be very brief at the front, because I want to mainly take questions from folks not just here but all around the world.  Today is a solemn day.  I started my day commemorating 9/11 and all the people who were killed on that day.  And Ive had an opportunity as President to meet with many of the survivors, the family members of those who were killed.  And on this particular day, we are constantly reminded of their loss.  We want to let them know that we do not forget those who are fallen.  We are inspired by the survivors, many of whom still have the scars, both seen and unseen, of that terrible, terrible day.  And its also a good time to remember all the people who have served and sacrificed since 9/11 in order to keep America safe and free. We have veterans now from every state in the union who have served oftentimes in multiple tours, both in Iraq and Afghanistan.  And although we have made enormous strides in degrading the core al Qaeda, including bin Laden himself that had helped to direct the plot on 9/11, we are well aware of the fact that those threats still exist out there. And here at Fort Meade, we do some of the most important work in helping to coordinate our efforts to make sure that we are bringing to bear all elements of American power against those who would try to do us harm here in the homeland or overseas, or would threaten our allies.  Despite the progress weve made in Afghanistan, its still critically important that weve got thousands of trainers and advisors who are supporting the Afghan military efforts there.  Our combat role is complete, but we still have to make sure that they are getting the kind of help and assistance that they need.  The emergence of ISIL in Iraq and Syria has meant that we have to be present and we are pounding them every single day.  Our airmen are doing extraordinary work with the support of all the other service branches.  And were providing training and assistance and support to the Iraqi security forces on the ground as they continue to push back ISIL from territory that they had taken. But both in Iraq and in Syria, in Afghanistan, in North Africa, what were very clear about is, is that we still have significant threats coming from terrorist organizations and a terrorist ideology.  We also have the traditional threats that our military has to be prepared for -- from a new Pacific region where historically we have underwritten the security and prosperity of a region that came back after World War II and where we have tremendous alliances, to Europe and our role as the cornerstone of NATO. And so we are going to continually have to work at every level to make sure that our men and women in uniform are provided the strategy they need to succeed, the resources they need to succeed, the equipment, the training.  And in this new era, thats not just a matter of tanks and rifles; as everybody I think here is aware, especially here at Fort Meade, cybersecurity is opening up a whole new era in which we have to watch out for our adversaries. So on 9/11, I thought it was particularly appropriate for me to be able to address you directly, and to say thank you on behalf of the American people.  When I look out in this audience and when I think about all the members of the armed services all around the world who serve, this represents America.  Youve got people of every race, religion, faith, every region of the country.  But what we share is a common creed, a common commitment to freedom, a common commitment to rule of law, a common belief that America is an indispensable force for good around the world, and that our military is a linchpin in our ability to project our values alongside our diplomatic efforts, our economy, and the people-to-people relations that helped to spread those core beliefs that all of you are willing to sacrifice for.  So I want to say thank you to you.  I want to especially say thank you to those who are serving overseas and who are watching here today because many of them are away from family right now.  We are grateful for your service.  I dont have a greater honor than serving as your Commander-in-Chief.  And every single day I see the extraordinary work that you do and I benefit from it as well. So with that, why dont we start taking some questions? Moderator Parry:  Yes, of course, sir.  As you mentioned, we do have family members and service members worldwide watching this worldwide troop talk through American Forces Network and on ships at sea.  Were going to go out there in a little bit, but the first question we do want to be represented from one of the many service members we have here.  So the first question will go out to the audience if someone has one ready. Sergeant Harvey. Sergeant Harvey:  Good morning, Mr. President -- good afternoon. President Obama:  Good afternoon. Sergeant Harvey:  Im Sergeant Brianna Harvey [ph].  Im from Texas.  And my question is, what made you initiate MBK on the 27th of February in 2014?  And will you create something similar for females?  And what will you miss the most once youre no longer President and out of the Oval Office? President Obama:  Well, those are great questions.  What part of Texas you from? Sergeant Harvey:  Harker Heights, Texas. President Obama:  Harker Heights, Texas. Sergeant Harvey:  Yes, Mr. President. President Obama:  Well, tell everybody back home I said hi.  Sergeant Harvey:  Yes, sir. President Obama:  For service members who arent aware, what were referring to when we talk about MBK is what we call My Brothers Keeper.  One of the most important principles I think of America is that no matter who you are, no matter what you look like, if you work hard, you can get ahead.  And there are pockets of poverty in places where people dont have an opportunity, and thats particularly true among young men who too often are ending up in prison instead of going to school or serving in our military. And so what weve been trying to do is to setup mentorship programs, make sure that theyre aware of whats going on, provide them with job training.  I had a meeting with some folks in New Orleans -- young men who just come from terrible circumstances, terrible neighborhoods -- and we want to make sure that they are aware of how they can break the cycle and do right by themselves and ultimately do right by their families. And one of the young men who was sitting next to me was interested in enrolling in the Marines, but he was worried that he had heard a rumor that he might not be able to serve in the Marines if he had tattoos.  I said, I dont think -- Ive met a lot of Marines, I dont think thats going to be a problem.  But it gives you a sense of some young people are so out of the loop and have so little exposure that they dont know where to go and how to apply themselves in ways that allow them to succeed.  So we are working diligently on that -- not just ourselves, but businesses and our military leaders are helping out on this issue.  Young women, we have a whole other set of initiatives in the White House called -- we have a White House Council on Women and Girls to provide opportunity for them as well.  I have to say, generally, the young women are doing better than the young men -- thats because you guys are a little smarter, but obviously they need opportunities as well. In terms of what Im going to miss the most, I meant what I said:  The greatest privilege I have is serving as your Commander-in-Chief.  When I travel around the world, every place I go, I see folks who are doing incredible work.  And its not typically fighting.  A lot of times its helping train other countries so that they can secure themselves.  A lot of times its helping on engineering projects or development projects or helping people after a natural disaster.  You are ambassadors and spread good will around the world every single day at enormous sacrifice to yourselves.  And so Ill miss that a lot. The plane is nice, too -- I got to admit, but my lease is running out.  So Im hoping that Im not going to have to start taking off my shoes again going through security.  What I wont miss is the fact that I can -- I live in whats called the bubble, right, so they dont let me go anywhere.  So if I just want to go take a walk, Ive got to have helicopters and boats and all that stuff.  And even when I cross the Potomac, theyve got everybody in position.  And I cant just on a Saturday morning go down to Starbucks or something, not shave.  It sounds pretty good to me.  So those are some of the things Ill be doing when I get out of here.  And I probably wont wear a tie for at least a month.  Thank you very much. Sergeant Harvey:  Thank you, Mr. President. Moderator Parry:  Thank you, Sergeant Harvey for that question.  I promised we were going to go worldwide, sir, and we are.  Your first question from overseas is a place that you are familiar with, youve traveled there a few times and Im sure our service members are familiar with it as well.  Our first question is going to come from downrange.  And Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us there. Petty Officer Laurie Bent [Moderator]:  Mr. President, we have your first live satellite question from Afghanistan.  We have Sergeant Aaron Giese.  Sergeant Giese, if you can hear me, go ahead and nod.  You are on the line with the President.  Go ahead with your question. Sergeant Giese:  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  My name is Sergeant Aaron Giese, and I first want to take time to thank you for the opportunity to speak with me today. President Obama:  Thank you, Aaron. Sergeant Giese:  My question for you is, due to the recent Russian activity in Syria and the possibility of future activity, how will that affect our current military strategy within the region?   President Obama:  Well, it's a great question, Aaron.  First of all, let me just say thank you for your service, and please tell everybody in your unit that we appreciate them as well, that we're thinking about them and you're in our thoughts and prayers. As I indicated in my opening remarks, we've done an incredible job in going after and systematically dismantling the core al Qaeda network that was operating primarily in the FATA region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  They still pose a threat, but it is much diminished.  But whats happened with this radical, violent extremism is that it's metastasized and it's spread to other areas.  And right now, ground zero for those activities is in Syria with ISIL. And our strategy has consistently been that we will use our airpower to support efforts by Iraqi security forces on the ground and, where we can find it, moderate opposition inside of Syria to push back on ISIL -- to put pressure on them, to go after their financing, to go after their networks, their supplies.  A lot of their operations are funded by oil sales, and so blocking those, going after the infrastructure that theyve built up. Those strategies will all continue.  The challenge we've had in Syria is that the President there, Bashar al-Assad, has been so destructive towards his own people, destroying entire cities, dropping bombs, creating a sectarian conflict between Shia and Sunni inside of Syria, that it has become a magnet for jihadists throughout the region. And the good news is, is that Russia shares with us a concern about countering violent extremism and shares with us the view that ISIL is very dangerous.  So despite our conflicts with Russia in areas like Ukraine, this is an area potentially of converging interest.  The bad news is that Russia continues to believe that Assad, who is their traditional partner, is somebody that is worthy of continuing support.  And it has been my view and the view of the United States government that as long as Assad is there, he has alienated so much of the Syrian population that it will not be possible to arrive at a peaceful cease-fire and political settlement, and youll continue to have this vacuum that's filled by extremists. So Russia has, for many years now, provided financial support, sold arms to Assad.  I remember a conversation I had with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, where I told him that was a mistake, it would make things worse as long as he continued to support Assad.  He did not take my warnings, and as a consequence things have gotten worse. It appears now that Assad is worried enough that hes inviting Russian advisors in and Russian equipment in.  And that won't change our core strategy, which is to continue to put pressure on ISIL in Iraq and Syria, but we are going to be engaging Russia to let them know that you can't continue to double-down on a strategy thats doomed to failure.  And if they are willing to work with us and the 60-nation coalition that we've put together, then theres the possibility of a political settlement in which Assad would be transitioned out and a new coalition of moderate, secular and inclusive forces could come together and restore order in the country. That's our goal.  This is going to be a long discussion that we'll be having with the Russians, but it is not going to prevent us from continuing to go after ISIL very hard.  It could prevent us from arriving at the political settlement that ultimately is needed to bring a peace back to Syria.  And this is where our military efforts have to be combined with effective diplomatic efforts. One of the things that I've said to all of our men and women in uniform is that you shouldnt be fighting for our security and our freedom alone; youve got to have the support of diplomats and intelligence experts and others, because although you are vital and necessary, if you're doing it by yourselves, we can win any battle, but our main challenge right now in a lot of these countries -- like Syria and Afghanistan and Libya and North Africa -- is disorder.  And the only way you restore order -- unless you're occupying every country that starts breaking down -- is through political negotiations and settlement.  And that's where the Russians are going to have to start getting a little smarter than they have been.  Because they are threatened in many ways more than we are by ISIL.  Theyve got large Muslim populations that historically have caused a lot of problems inside of Russia.  And the strategy that theyre pursuing right now of doubling down on Assad I think is a big mistake.   Moderator Parry: Thank you, Sergeant Giese, for that question from Afghanistan.  We here at the Defense Media Activity do hope that you and others downrange do stay safe. We do have thousands of members overseas watching the American Forces network, or theyre streaming live on Defense.gov, and they, too, are eager to talk to you, Mr. President.  And they can through social media.  In fact, Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us out there now. Moderator Bent:  Our next question is going to come from Twitter.  Sir, we have a question from JRita2192.  Mr. President, can you share with us your personal experience and memories of when 9/11 first happened? President Obama:  It was interesting -- Michelle and I were just talking about that this morning. Sasha, my youngest daughter, had just been born.  She was four or five months old.  And September 11th was Malias first day of preschool or kindergarten -- I think it was kindergarten.  So Michelle had gone with the girls to drop Malia off at school.  They were tiny.  I was at the time a state senator, so I was going to downtown Chicago to a hearing on an issue.  And I remember driving on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago and hearing the reports of a plane crashing into the buildings.  And at first, the reports were unclear, so you thought it was a Cessna or some accident had happened.  And it wasnt until I got downtown to where the hearing was taking place that we started realizing it was something much more serious. And at that time, no one was sure whether this was a one-off or whether this was going to be an ongoing attack, because then you started getting reports from the Pentagon and other places.  So the building was evacuated.  And I remember standing downtown Chicago with thousands of other people, and there were a lot of targets, obviously, for possible action, this including -- at the time, it was called the Sears Tower.  And people didnt know what to think.  And then I remember going to my law office, and thats when we saw the images of the Twin Towers starting to come down. And that evening, I have very vivid memories of giving Sasha a bottle and rocking her to sleep while we were watching the aftermath of those attacks.  And like I think everybody here, although most of you were a lot younger, it gave you a sense, for the first time in my lifetime, that our homeland could be vulnerable in that way.  We hadnt seen an attack like that since Pearl Harbor. And I think it inspired all of us to remember just how precious what we have is, and the need for us to defend it at any cost.  And although subsequently I would have strong disagreements with the previous administration about certain decisions that were made, I remember and give great credit to President Bush for being at the site, throwing out that first pitch at Yankee Stadium, and everyone remembering that youre not a Democrat first or a Republican first, or a Texan first or Californian first, youre an American, and that we all have to come together. And my hope is always on a day like today that we remember that sense that what binds us together is much more important than anything that divides us, and that what makes this country special is the fact that we are bound together -- we, or our parents, or our great-grandparents, we all come from different places, but we all have a shared creed, a shared belief system, and a shared set of commitments.  And all of you in your service exemplify that every day. Moderator Parry:  It was an excellent question from social media.  And our viewers can join us and join this conversation on social media from Twitter using the hashtag #askPOTUS, or the Department of Defenses Facebook page.  Were actually going to go back overseas for you, Mr. President, and Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us there. Moderator Bent:  Sir, we are headed to NATO -- Brussels, Belgium -- where were going to talk to Navy Commander Scot Cregan.  Commander Cregan, go ahead with your question for the President. Commander Cregan:  Thank you for your time, Mr. President.  I was honored to march in your inaugural parade in 2009, and we briefly met a few years later when I worked a Halloween White House event.  I was a Star Wars storm trooper. President Obama:  You were great. Commander Cregan:  You may not remember what I looked like because we all kind of looked alike.  On a serious note, were seeing more and more refugees coming to Europe by land and by sea.  Do you think there should be a NATO response to this crisis?   President Obama:  I think that we have to work with our European partners on this issue.  The refugee crisis is not just a European problem, it's a world problem.  And we have obligations. I made certain to send through every agency that we've got to do our part, first of all, in taking our share of refugees.  And those of you who saw some of these heartbreaking images of that small boy drowned -- I think anybody whos a parent understands that -- that stirs all of our consciences, not just folks on the other side of the Atlantic. So I've already been in discussions with people like Prime Minister Renzi of Italy, the Greeks, and others who are down south about how we can enhance maritime efforts to make sure, first of all, that people who are loading up on these rickety boats are safe and we're not seeing enormous loss of life there. We are encouraged by the efforts of the European Union to accept refugees in all countries and spread out some of the burdens and the pressure.  And as I said, the United States needs to do our share.  I said that we should establish a floor of at least 10,000 refugees that we're willing to accept, and cut through some of the bureaucracy and red tape to do that.  Ultimately, though, as you well know, it is really important for us to go to the source.  Theres the old story about if you see a bunch of bodies floating down a river, part of your job is to pull those folks out and save who you can, but youve also got to go downstream and see what exactly is happening.  And this refugee crisis is prompted by the collapse of governance in Syria and the growth of ISIL and the cruelty that Assad is perpetrating on his own people. And that's why the response I gave earlier, the importance of us continuing our military efforts against ISIL, but also trying to pull together a strong international, diplomatic effort to bring about some sort of political accord inside of Syria is going to be so important and so vital. Last point I'll make about this, though -- and this is where NATO planning becomes critical, even as we're, in the short term, helping countries respond to the immediate crisis -- unfortunately, we can anticipate that refugees will be an ongoing problem for decades to come.  And the reason is because there are too many states that are not doing well by their people.  The spread of media gives people in war-torn countries or in extreme poverty a vision of a better life, and they are desperate and willing to take extraordinary risks to get there.  You then have other factors that may end up resulting in more migration and refugees -- for example, climate change.  I just came back from Alaska, where you're seeing glaciers melt rapidly.  And as temperatures rise, the Pentagons own assessment is that this will end up being a national security challenge, in part because people will be displaced from their traditional lands either by drought or by flooding, and that can create more refugee problems. So we're going to have to work globally.  And one of the topics, I'm sure, when I go to the United Nations General Assembly leaders gathering that we typically have at the end of this month is to start coming up with a more effective structure for an international response.  No one country can solve these problems alone.  But the United States, obviously, as the worlds leader, and NATO, as the premier alliance in the world, is going to have to play a central role. Moderator Parry:  I want to thank the Lt. Commander for that question. Mr. President, we've been to Europe, to Afghanistan.  We've gone online, so I think it's time we come back to the studio here at the Defense Media Activity for a question. President Obama:  Lets do it. Question:  Good afternoon, Mr. President. [inaudible] from Arizona. You allude to in your opening remarks the threat that cyber currently is.  And theres been a lot of talk within the DOD and cyber community of the possibility of a separate branch of the military dedicated to cyber.  I was wondering where you see cyber in the next five to ten years. President Obama:  Well, it's a great question.  We initiated Cyber Command, anticipating that this is going to be a new theater for potential conflict.  And what we've seen by both state and non-state actors is the increasing sophistication of hacking, the ability to penetrate systems that we previously thought would be secure.  And it is moving fast.  So, offense is moving a lot faster than defense.    Part of this has to do with the way the Internet was originally designed.  It was not designed with the expectation that there would end up being three or four or five billion people doing commercial transactions, et cetera.  It was thought this was just going to be an academic network to share papers and formulas and whatnot.  And so the architecture of the Internet makes it very difficult to defend consistently. We continue to be the best in the world at understanding and working within cyber.  But other countries have caught up.  The Russians are good.  The Chinese are good.  The Iranians are good. And youve got non-state hackers who are excellent.  And unlike traditional conflicts and aggression, oftentimes we don't have a return address.  If somebody hacks into a system and goes after critical infrastructure, for example, or penetrates our financial systems, we can't necessarily trace it directly to that state or that actor.  That makes it more difficult as well. So what we've done is to try to emphasize, number one, the need for a coordinated response.  And over the last several years, what we've done is to bring together our military agencies, Cyber Command, with the NSA, with our intelligence, and working with the private sector to try to strengthen our defenses much better.  And we've made progress, but we're not making enough progress.  So I would anticipate that we are going to have to do more both through the Defense Department, but again, we're going to have to work -- because this is not a traditional war theater -- we're going to have to work with a whole bunch of other actors and coordinate with them much more effectively. The bulk of vulnerable information and data isn't in our military; it's in the private sector.  It's throughout our economy.  It's on your smartphones.  And so we're going to have to both strengthen overall networks, but we're also going to have to train millions of individual actors -- small businesses, big vendors, individuals -- in terms of basic cyber hygiene.  We're going to have to be much more rapid in responding to attacks.  And this is something that we're just at the infancy of.  Ultimately, one of the solutions we're going to have to come up with is to craft agreements among at least state actors about whats acceptable and whats not.  And so, for example, I'm going to be getting a visit from President Xi of China, a state visit here coming up in a couple of weeks.  We've made very clear to the Chinese that there are certain practices that theyre engaging in that we know are emanating from China and are not acceptable.  And we can choose to make this an area of competition -- which I guarantee you we'll win if we have to -- or, alternatively, we can come to an agreement in which we say, this isn't helping anybody; lets instead try to have some basic rules of the road in terms of how we operate. Now, as I said, theres still going to be individual actors, there are going to be terrorist networks and others, so we're still going to have to build a strong defense.  But one of our first and most important efforts has to be to get the states that may be sponsoring cyber-attacks to understand that there comes a point at which we consider this a core national security threat and we will treat it as such. Moderator Parry:  Excellent question from one of our cyber warriors here at Fort Meade, Maryland. President Obama:  He looks like he knows what hes doing.  Moderator Parry:  Well, we are here on the East Coast, but I hear Petty Officer Lori Bent wants to take us all the way to the West Coast for your next question. Moderator Bent:  Yes, our next question comes from Joint Base Lewis-McChord from a C-17 instructor pilot, Major Jennifer Moore. Major Moore, go ahead with your question. Major Moore:  Mr. President, good afternoon.  Sir, both my husband and I have been serving side-by-side as C-17 and T-6 instructor pilots for the past 11 years, and we have two amazing and thriving children.  How do you and Mrs. Obama know how to balance life and work to ensure your children will grow up to be successful in their future endeavors? President Obama:  Well, first of all, thanks to you and your husband both for serving.  And tell your kids I said hi and that they should do what you tell them to do.  How old are your kids? Major Moore:  Well, my daughter, Gabby, is seven and my son, Robert, is four.  I have a picture, sir.  It would kill me if I didnt have an opportunity to show you. President Obama:  Sure.  Hold up the picture.  Oh, thats a good-looking crew right there.  Theyre adorable. Major Moore:  Absolutely.  The happiest place on Earth, thank you, sir. President Obama:  Well, Ill give you -- the best advice that I probably can offer is for me, at least, I just do what Michelle tells me to do and it seems to work out.  And your husband may take the same approach.  And those are great ages -- seven and four -- because you come home and theyre jumping on you, and so excited to see you.  When they get to be 17 and 14, then they still love you, but youre not very interesting. But everybody here, the demands of your jobs are so extraordinary, and its not like youre always on the clock, youve just got to get the job done.  And that puts a lot of pressure on folks.  One thing I know we can do is make sure that our military is supporting families, and that means making sure that housing and child care, all the things that go into supporting families when theyre stationed -- particularly given how much theyre moving -- becomes absolutely critical.  And Michelle has worked with Dr. Jill Biden on Joining Forces to make sure that we are spending a lot of time thinking about how are we supporting military families on an ongoing basis, including those spouses who are not in service but who are serving alongside, and do so much critical work -- making sure that they have the opportunity, for example, to find a job if theyre getting transferred, and have the kind of backing that they need.  So thats really important.  You shouldnt have to do this alone.  What Michelle and I did with Malia and Sasha I think early on is we just -- were a strong believer in structure and rules, and unconditional love but being pretty firm, too.  We started real early:  Heres your bedtime.  Heres when youre not watching TV.  Youll sit there and eat your vegetables even if we have to sit there with you, watch you chew for 10 minutes -- and were going to watch you swallow.   And if you start early enough with just high expectations, I think kids do well with that.  And part of that involves just loving those kids to death, but also letting them know, you know what, Im your parent, Im not your best friend.  So Im not that interested in what your friends are doing -- theyve got parents, their parents can make a decision.  This is what youre doing in our house.  And when you leave here, youll be able to make your own decisions, but were trying to prepare you so that youve got some sense when you get out of here.  And I think thats worked.  I think thats been appreciated. Sometimes they complain.  They say, well, how come so-and-so is able to stay out until whatever hour?  Its like, well, thats not really our problem, is it?  And theyre getting old enough now where sometimes they appreciate it -- mainly because they also know that we just -- we adore them. And last thing, I guess, is just, as much as possible, we try to make sure every night when were home that they have to sit down and eat dinner with us.  Im a big believer in not getting the TV trays out and watching the Kardashians.  You sit down, leave your cell phone somewhere else, and well have a conversation.  And that seems to help, too. Thats all, by the way, me just channeling Michelle.  Like I said, the main thing for your husband to do is just listen to you.  Moderator Parry:  That was an excellent question and I know my wife, Jazzy, would agree.  I listen to her day in and day out. Major Moore:  Ill tell him that, sir.  Thank you very much. President Obama:  Thank you. Moderator Parry:  And I know, Im sure all of our service members who have families would agree a large part of why we do what we do and how we can do what we do is those loved ones we have at home.  President Obama:  Absolutely. Moderator Parry:  Im sure we all appreciate our family members there.  So we do have family members watching on American Forces Network -- I know my wife, shes watching on Defense.gov right now with my two-year-old son -- and they have an opportunity to talk to you as well through social media.  President Obama:  Excellent. Moderator Parry:  Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us there now. Moderator Bent:  We are headed online to Facebook.  Sir, this question is coming from Michael Ong:  Mr. President, how do you keep striving for great accomplishment with a positive attitude while everyone seems to be hating and talking smack about you and all you do? President Obama:  Yeah!  You know, the truth is, is that not everyone is talking smack about me.  But there is a sizable percentage in Congress that talks smack about me, no doubt about it.  Its interesting -- when you go into public service, I think there are two ways to approach it.  One way to approach it is that you just want to be popular. You want to get elected, you want to stay in office, you want to be popular.  Another way of approaching it is, I want a particular position because I want to get something done for the American people.  And not everything that is right to do is going to be the popular thing to do.  And I made a decision early on that if I was going to do this, if I was going to run for elected office, that I had to have some core, some set of beliefs and principles, and that there would be times where I made mistakes or I made a wrong call, but that I was guided by what I thought was best for the American people, and that I couldnt worry about short-term popularity if I was going to do my best. So Ill give you a good example.  When I came into office, early on, we had the worst financial crisis in our history.  One of the casualties of that was the U.S. auto industry.  The big three automakers were on the verge of flat-lining, and were getting all these bailouts but they werent changing what they were doing.  And a lot of folks thought that Chrysler was going to go bankrupt, and then GM was going to go next, and then all the suppliers would lose out, and pretty soon all we would be able to buy is Japanese and Korean and German cars. And I said, this is an industry thats too important -- one that we essentially built -- for us to be able to just let it go. And I knew that we had to put more money into it to get the industry back on its feet, but I also knew that we had to force them to make management changes so they could start building good cars and competing again. Well, I tell you, when we put forward our plan, I think that 10 percent of people agreed with it.  Even in Michigan, I think the overwhelming majority of people opposed it, opposed our plan. And if I had been thinking in terms of just looking at the poll numbers, I wouldnt have done it.  But I looked at the evidence and what I thought was going to be best, and we did it.  And this year, were probably going to sell more U.S. cars than we have in 20 years, and theyve hired back hundreds of thousands of workers, and its been driving a rebound of American manufacturing that is vital to our economy.  So the longer Im in this office, the more committed I am to making those calls.  And part of the challenge in this job is, is that if its an easy question it doesnt get to my desk.  The only things that come to my desk are things that somebody else hasnt been able to solve.  And my job is to make a decision based on sometimes imperfect information and youre working on the percentages.  When I made the order for us to go in and get bin Laden at that house in Pakistan, it was probably a 50/50 proposition as to whether that was, in fact, him, and the risks obviously were enormous.  If I had been making that decision based on wanting to avoid risk and not having somebody talk smack about me, then that might not be a decision that I would have been prepared to make. And part of this is my own personal faith and prayer, and part of it is the support of an incredible family and friends.  And part of it is seeing the sacrifices that all of you make.  When I go to Walter Reed and I visit wounded troops, then I say to myself, well, Ive got to be serious about what I do, and I cant be worrying about poll numbers or what cable TV says.  Ive got to make sure that I am, to the best of my abilities, making the decisions that I think are going to be most important for American prosperity and American security over the long term. And that way, you can at least sleep at night.  That way when I go to bed, I go to bed easy, because I know that Ive made the best decisions I could make. Now, the only way that works is if Im also open and listening to see if the decisions I made were the right ones, is it working.  And Ive got to be open to the fact that sometimes I may not make the right decision, and Im willing to correct it.  And Ive got to own that.  And thats what I always tell everybody in the White House, is if somebody screws up -- because there will be some screw-ups -- own it and correct it, and learn from it.  And what applies to everybody on my team applies to me, as well. So I think some of you may recall when we passed health care, everything was working fine until there was this website that didnt work.  It was a disaster -- even though I had been asking every two weeks, hows the website going, I hope this works.  But it didnt work.  And we had to own that and double down.  And we corrected it in three or four months, and now 16 million people have health insurance that didnt have it before, and it actually costs less than people anticipated.  It's working the way it should have.  But that was a screw-up, and theres no point in trying to hide things when they dont work.  So I guess the last thing Id say is I tend to just take the long view on things.  Political polls and what the pundits say and what other politicians say -- that comes and goes.  It goes up and goes down.  I try to think 20 years from now, when I look back, will people say, this person operated with integrity and made decisions that were best for the country.  And so far thats working for me, anyway.  It doesnt mean Im not sometimes a little offended.  Thats why I go to the gym, work it off.  Moderator Parry:  Well, Mr. President, your next question -- Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us overseas. Moderator Bent:  Sir, your next question is coming from Gunnery Sergeant Bryson Elliott, and hes at U.S. AFRICOM Stuttgart, Germany.  Gunny, go ahead with your question. Gunnery Sergeant Elliott:  First of all, sir, thank you.  Good afternoon.  Thank you for taking my question.  Mr. President, my question is, how are military exercises like African Lion with Morocco strengthening the relationships between the U.S. and African nations? President Obama:  Well, its a great question.  And thank you for your service.  Tell everybody at AFRICOM we appreciate them. I just came back from Africa several months ago, and there are huge challenges there, but also huge opportunities.  First of all, thats a continent that appreciates America.  When you look at polls, the continent as a whole, their positive views of America are as high as any other continent in the world.  So the people of the African continent admire the United States.  They appreciate our values and our way of life, and theres a real connection. It also is the continent with some of the fastest-growing economies in the world.  I think we tend to have stereotypes about Africa as Ebola and poverty and all this stuff.  When you travel there, theyre moving.  And you go to cities there, and everybody has got a cell phone, and everybody is hustling, and everybody is working.  And thats going to be one of the great next arenas for economic growth and trade.  And that means that the United States is selling more goods there and theyre selling more here, and there are enormous opportunities.  So our prosperity with them is tied together.  What is also true is, is that there are parts of Africa -- particularly North Africa, but its seeping down along the coasts -- where violent Islamic extremism has taken hold.  And Somalia being a prime example where Al-Shabaab has been working for a long time; Boko Haram in Nigeria; al Qaeda in the Maghreb.  And so we have to have a strategy to partner with those countries to ensure that our intelligence capabilities, our rapid-response capabilities, and their own capabilities for maintaining order and pushing back against extremism -- that they are a lot stronger in the years to come. The good news is that these countries are eager for that kind of cooperation.  Countries like Nigeria, countries like Kenya welcome our presence, welcome our training of their troops. We have excellent CT cooperation with them.  The big problem theyve got is capacity, but capacity is one of those things you can solve where youve got a willing partner.  So were working with the joint chiefs to develop plans so that we are continuing to build up partnership capabilities across the continent.  And that will help us not only with homegrown problems inside of Africa, but those platforms then also allow us to act more effectively against deeply rooted organizations like al Qaeda on the peninsula in Yemen, because thats right across the ocean and we want to be able to make sure that we can target those terrorist networks effectively.  Having African partners helps us do that. Moderator Parry:  Mr. President, were hoping to squeeze in at least one more question. President Obama:  Come on. Moderator Parry:  Excellent.  Because I promised you earlier, we have viewers out at sea -- in fact, thats where Petty Officer Lori Bent is going to take us now.  Moderator Bent:  And what do you know, this sailor is going to take you out to sea for your next question, Mr. President.  This is coming from the deployed USS Theodore Roosevelt, and on the phone, we have Petty Officer Joseph Everett.  Petty Officer Everett, you are on the line.  Go ahead. Petty Office Everett:  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  Im Petty Officer Joseph Everett calling you from the Theodore Roosevelt.  I just want to thank you for taking the time to talk to me. President Obama:  Hey, Joe. Petty Office Everett:  Im very honored to have this opportunity. President Obama:  Hold on, Joe, were having trouble hearing you here.  Slight technical difficulties.  But if somebody can hear, they can repeat the question to us. Moderator Parry:  Petty Officer Everett, would you like to try that question again? Petty Office Everett:  Good afternoon, Mr. President.  This is Petty Officer Joseph Everett calling you from the Theodore Roosevelt.  I just want to thank you for giving me this opportunity today, and Im very honored. President Obama:  Well, I can hear you just fine now, Joe.  And tell everybody on the ship we appreciate them, hope they get back home safe.  You got a question for us? Petty Office Everett:  Yes, Mr. President.  During your presidency, youve had a lot of great experiences.  What would you say is your most rewarding?", "filename": "11September2015WorldwideTroopTalkatFortMeade.txt"}, {"question": "In my first Inaugural Address, I committed this country to the tireless task of combating climate change and protecting this planet for future generations.  Two weeks ago, in Paris, I said before the world that we needed a strong global agreement to accomplish this goal -- an enduring agreement that reduces global carbon pollution and sets the world on a course to a low-carbon future.  A few hours ago, we succeeded.  We came together around the strong agreement the world needed.  We met the moment. I want to commend President Hollande and Secretary General Ban for their leadership and for hosting such a successful summit, and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius for presiding with patience and resolve.  And I want to give a special thanks to Secretary John Kerry, my Senior Advisor Brian Deese, our chief negotiator Todd Stern, and everyone on their teams for their outstanding work and for making America proud. I also want to thank the people of nearly 200 nations -- large and small, developed and developing -- for working together to confront a threat to the people of all nations.  Together, weve shown whats possible when the world stands as one. Today, the American people can be proud -- because this historic agreement is a tribute to American leadership.  Over the past seven years, weve transformed the United States into the global leader in fighting climate change.  In 2009, we helped salvage a chaotic Copenhagen Summit and established the principle that all countries had a role to play in combating climate change.  We then led by example, with historic investments in growing industries like wind and solar, creating a new and steady stream of middle-class jobs.  Weve set the first-ever nationwide standards to limit the amount of carbon pollution power plants can dump into the air our children breathe.  From Alaska to the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains, weve partnered with local leaders who are working to help their communities protect themselves from some of the most immediate impacts of a changing climate.    Now, skeptics said these actions would kill jobs.  Instead, weve seen the longest streak of private-sector job creation in our history.  Weve driven our economic output to all-time highs while driving our carbon pollution down to its lowest level in nearly two decades.  And then, with our historic joint announcement with China last year, we showed it was possible to bridge the old divides between developed and developing nations that had stymied global progress for so long.  That accomplishment encouraged dozens and dozens of other nations to set their own ambitious climate targets.  And that was the foundation for success in Paris.  Because no nation, not even one as powerful as ours, can solve this challenge alone.  And no country, no matter how small, can sit on the sidelines.  All of us had to solve it together.  Now, no agreement is perfect, including this one.  Negotiations that involve nearly 200 nations are always challenging.  Even if all the initial targets set in Paris are met, well only be part of the way there when it comes to reducing carbon from the atmosphere.  So we cannot be complacent because of todays agreement.  The problem is not solved because of this accord.  But make no mistake, the Paris agreement establishes the enduring framework the world needs to solve the climate crisis.  It creates the mechanism, the architecture, for us to continually tackle this problem in an effective way.    This agreement is ambitious, with every nation setting and committing to their own specific targets, even as we take into account differences among nations.  Well have a strong system of transparency, including periodic reviews and independent assessments, to help hold every country accountable for meeting its commitments.  As technology advances, this agreement allows progress to pave the way for even more ambitious targets over time.  And we have secured a broader commitment to support the most vulnerable countries as they pursue cleaner economic growth. In short, this agreement will mean less of the carbon pollution that threatens our planet, and more of the jobs and economic growth driven by low-carbon investment.  Full implementation of this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change, and will pave the way for even more progress, in successive stages, over the coming years. Moreover, this agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is firmly committed to a low-carbon future.  And that has the potential to unleash investment and innovation in clean energy at a scale we have never seen before.  The targets weve set are bold.  And by empowering businesses, scientists, engineers, workers, and the private sector -- investors -- to work together, this agreement represents the best chance weve had to save the one planet that weve got.  So I believe this moment can be a turning point for the world.  Weve shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge.  It wont be easy.  Progress wont always come quick.  We cannot be complacent.  While our generation will see some of the benefits of building a clean energy economy -- jobs created and money saved -- we may not live to see the full realization of our achievement.  But thats okay.  What matters is that today we can be more confident that this planet is going to be in better shape for the next generation.  And thats what I care about.  I imagine taking my grandkids, if Im lucky enough to have some, to the park someday, and holding their hands, and hearing their laughter, and watching a quiet sunset, all the while knowing that our work today prevented an alternate future that could have been grim; that our work, here and now, gave future generations cleaner air, and cleaner water, and a more sustainable planet.  And what could be more important than that?", "filename": "12December2015StatementonParisClimateAgreement.txt"}, {"question": "Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, fellow citizens: Fifty-one years ago, John F. Kennedy declared to this chamber that the Constitution makes us not rivals for power but partners for progress.  It is my task, he said, to report the State of the Union -- to improve it is the task of us all. Tonight, thanks to the grit and determination of the American people, there is much progress to report.  After a decade of grinding war, our brave men and women in uniform are coming home.  After years of grueling recession, our businesses have created over six million new jobs.  We buy more American cars than we have in five years, and less foreign oil than we have in 20.  Our housing market is healing, our stock market is rebounding, and consumers, patients, and homeowners enjoy stronger protections than ever before. So, together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the State of our Union is stronger. But we gather here knowing that there are millions of Americans whose hard work and dedication have not yet been rewarded.  Our economy is adding jobs -- but too many people still cant find full-time employment.  Corporate profits have skyrocketed to all-time highs -- but for more than a decade, wages and incomes have barely budged. It is our generations task, then, to reignite the true engine of Americas economic growth -- a rising, thriving middle class. It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country -- the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or who you love. It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation. The American people dont expect government to solve every problem.  They dont expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue.  But they do expect us to put the nations interests before party.  They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can.  For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all. Our work must begin by making some basic decisions about our budget -- decisions that will have a huge impact on the strength of our recovery. Over the last few years, both parties have worked together to reduce the deficit by more than $2.5 trillion -- mostly through spending cuts, but also by raising tax rates on the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.  As a result, we are more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances. Now we need to finish the job.  And the question is, how? In 2011, Congress passed a law saying that if both parties couldnt agree on a plan to reach our deficit goal, about a trillion dollars worth of budget cuts would automatically go into effect this year.  These sudden, harsh, arbitrary cuts would jeopardize our military readiness.  Theyd devastate priorities like education, and energy, and medical research.  They would certainly slow our recovery, and cost us hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Thats why Democrats, Republicans, business leaders, and economists have already said that these cuts, known here in Washington as the sequester, are a really bad idea. Now, some in Congress have proposed preventing only the defense cuts by making even bigger cuts to things like education and job training, Medicare and Social Security benefits.  That idea is even worse. Yes, the biggest driver of our long-term debt is the rising cost of health care for an aging population.  And those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms -- otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations. But we cant ask senior citizens and working families to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.  We wont grow the middle class simply by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or by forcing communities to lay off more teachers and more cops and more firefighters.  Most Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- understand that we cant just cut our way to prosperity.  They know that broad-based economic growth requires a balanced approach to deficit reduction, with spending cuts and revenue, and with everybody doing their fair share.  And thats the approach I offer tonight. On Medicare, Im prepared to enact reforms that will achieve the same amount of health care savings by the beginning of the next decade as the reforms proposed by the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles commission. Already, the Affordable Care Act is helping to slow the growth of health care costs.  And the reforms Im proposing go even further.  Well reduce taxpayer subsidies to prescription drug companies and ask more from the wealthiest seniors.  Well bring down costs by changing the way our government pays for Medicare, because our medical bills shouldnt be based on the number of tests ordered or days spent in the hospital; they should be based on the quality of care that our seniors receive.  And I am open to additional reforms from both parties, so long as they dont violate the guarantee of a secure retirement.  Our government shouldnt make promises we cannot keep -- but we must keep the promises weve already made. To hit the rest of our deficit reduction target, we should do what leaders in both parties have already suggested, and save hundreds of billions of dollars by getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off and the well-connected.  After all, why would we choose to make deeper cuts to education and Medicare just to protect special interest tax breaks?  How is that fair?  Why is it that deficit reduction is a big emergency justifying making cuts in Social Security benefits but not closing some loopholes?  How does that promote growth? Now is our best chance for bipartisan, comprehensive tax reform that encourages job creation and helps bring down the deficit.  We can get this done.  The American people deserve a tax code that helps small businesses spend less time filling out complicated forms, and more time expanding and hiring -- a tax code that ensures billionaires with high-powered accountants cant work the system and pay a lower rate than their hardworking secretaries; a tax code that lowers incentives to move jobs overseas, and lowers tax rates for businesses and manufacturers that are creating jobs right here in the United States of America.  Thats what tax reform can deliver.  Thats what we can do together. I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy.  The politics will be hard for both sides.  None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.  But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans.  So lets set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.  And lets do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors.  The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.  We can't do it. Lets agree right here, right now to keep the peoples government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.  The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another. Now, most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda.  But lets be clear, deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.   A growing economy that creates good, middle-class jobs -- that must be the North Star that guides our efforts.  Every day, we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation:  How do we attract more jobs to our shores?  How do we equip our people with the skills they need to get those jobs?  And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living? A year and a half ago, I put forward an American Jobs Act that independent economists said would create more than 1 million new jobs.  And I thank the last Congress for passing some of that agenda.  I urge this Congress to pass the rest.  But tonight, Ill lay out additional proposals that are fully paid for and fully consistent with the budget framework both parties agreed to just 18 months ago.  Let me repeat -- nothing Im proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.  It is not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.  That's what we should be looking for. Our first priority is making America a magnet for new jobs and manufacturing.  After shedding jobs for more than 10 years, our manufacturers have added about 500,000 jobs over the past three.  Caterpillar is bringing jobs back from Japan.  Ford is bringing jobs back from Mexico.  And this year, Apple will start making Macs in America again. There are things we can do, right now, to accelerate this trend.  Last year, we created our first manufacturing innovation institute in Youngstown, Ohio.  A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything.  Theres no reason this cant happen in other towns. So tonight, Im announcing the launch of three more of these manufacturing hubs, where businesses will partner with the Department of Defense and Energy to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs.  And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made right here in America.  We can get that done. Now, if we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas.  Every dollar we invested to map the human genome returned $140 to our economy -- every dollar.  Today, our scientists are mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimers.  Theyre developing drugs to regenerate damaged organs; devising new material to make batteries 10 times more powerful.  Now is not the time to gut these job-creating investments in science and innovation.  Now is the time to reach a level of research and development not seen since the height of the Space Race.  We need to make those investments. Today, no area holds more promise than our investments in American energy.  After years of talking about it, were finally poised to control our own energy future.  We produce more oil at home than we have in 15 years. We have doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas, and the amount of renewable energy we generate from sources like wind and solar -- with tens of thousands of good American jobs to show for it.  We produce more natural gas than ever before -- and nearly everyones energy bill is lower because of it.  And over the last four years, our emissions of the dangerous carbon pollution that threatens our planet have actually fallen. But for the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat climate change.  Now, its true that no single event makes a trend.  But the fact is the 12 hottest years on record have all come in the last 15.  Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods -- all are now more frequent and more intense.  We can choose to believe that Superstorm Sandy, and the most severe drought in decades, and the worst wildfires some states have ever seen were all just a freak coincidence.  Or we can choose to believe in the overwhelming judgment of science -- and act before its too late. Now, the good news is we can make meaningful progress on this issue while driving strong economic growth.  I urge this Congress to get together, pursue a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago.  But if Congress wont act soon to protect future generations, I will.  I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy. Four years ago, other countries dominated the clean energy market and the jobs that came with it.  And weve begun to change that.  Last year, wind energy added nearly half of all new power capacity in America.  So lets generate even more.  Solar energy gets cheaper by the year -- lets drive down costs even further. As long as countries like China keep going all in on clean energy, so must we. Now, in the meantime, the natural gas boom has led to cleaner power and greater energy independence.  We need to encourage that.  And thats why my administration will keep cutting red tape and speeding up new oil and gas permits. Thats got to be part of an all-of-the-above plan.  But I also want to work with this Congress to encourage the research and technology that helps natural gas burn even cleaner and protects our air and our water. In fact, much of our new-found energy is drawn from lands and waters that we, the public, own together.  So tonight, I propose we use some of our oil and gas revenues to fund an Energy Security Trust that will drive new research and technology to shift our cars and trucks off oil for good.  If a nonpartisan coalition of CEOs and retired generals and admirals can get behind this idea, then so can we.  Lets take their advice and free our families and businesses from the painful spikes in gas prices weve put up with for far too long. Im also issuing a new goal for America:  Lets cut in half the energy wasted by our homes and businesses over the next 20 years.  We'll work with the states to do it.  Those states with the best ideas to create jobs and lower energy bills by constructing more efficient buildings will receive federal support to help make that happen. Americas energy sector is just one part of an aging infrastructure badly in need of repair.  Ask any CEO where theyd rather locate and hire -- a country with deteriorating roads and bridges, or one with high-speed rail and Internet; high-tech schools, self-healing power grids.  The CEO of Siemens America -- a company that brought hundreds of new jobs to North Carolina -- said that if we upgrade our infrastructure, theyll bring even more jobs.  And thats the attitude of a lot of companies all around the world.  And I know you want these job-creating projects in your district.  Ive seen all those ribbon-cuttings. So tonight, I propose a Fix-It-First program to put people to work as soon as possible on our most urgent repairs, like the nearly 70,000 structurally deficient bridges across the country. And to make sure taxpayers dont shoulder the whole burden, Im also proposing a Partnership to Rebuild America that attracts private capital to upgrade what our businesses need most:  modern ports to move our goods, modern pipelines to withstand a storm, modern schools worthy of our children.  Lets prove that theres no better place to do business than here in the United States of America, and lets start right away.  We can get this done. And part of our rebuilding effort must also involve our housing sector.  The good news is our housing market is finally healing from the collapse of 2007.  Home prices are rising at the fastest pace in six years.  Home purchases are up nearly 50 percent, and construction is expanding again. But even with mortgage rates near a 50-year low, too many families with solid credit who want to buy a home are being rejected.  Too many families who never missed a payment and want to refinance are being told no.  Thats holding our entire economy back.  We need to fix it. Right now, theres a bill in this Congress that would give every responsible homeowner in America the chance to save $3,000 a year by refinancing at todays rates.  Democrats and Republicans have supported it before, so what are we waiting for? Take a vote, and send me that bill.  Why would we be against that?  Why would that be a partisan issue, helping folks refinance?  Right now, overlapping regulations keep responsible young families from buying their first home.  Whats holding us back?", "filename": "12February2013FourthPresidentialStateoftheUnionSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "They were fulfilling a central tenet of the democracy envisioned by our founders - representatives of the people answering questions to their constituents, so as to carry their concerns back to our nations capital.  Gabby called it Congress on Your Corner - just an updated version of government of and by and for the people. And that quintessentially American scene, that was the scene that was shattered by a gunmans bullets.  And the six people who lost their lives on Saturday - they, too, represented what is best in us, what is best in America. Judge John Roll served our legal system for nearly 40 years. A graduate of this university and a graduate of this law school -- Judge Roll was recommended for the federal bench by John McCain 20 years ago -- appointed by President George H.W. Bush and rose to become Arizonas chief federal judge. His colleagues described him as the hardest-working judge within the Ninth Circuit.  He was on his way back from attending Mass, as he did every day, when he decided to stop by and say hi to his representative.  John is survived by his loving wife, Maureen, his three sons and his five beautiful grandchildren. George and Dorothy Morris - Dot to her friends - were high school sweethearts who got married and had two daughters.  They did everything together -- traveling the open road in their RV, enjoying what their friends called a 50-year honeymoon.  Saturday morning, they went by the Safeway to hear what their congresswoman had to say.  When gunfire rang out, George, a former Marine, instinctively tried to shield his wife.  Both were shot.  Dot passed away. A New Jersey native, Phyllis Schneck retired to Tucson to beat the snow.  But in the summer, she would return East, where her world revolved around her three children, her seven grandchildren and 2-year-old great-granddaughter.  A gifted quilter, shed often work under a favorite tree, or sometimes she'd sew aprons with the logos of the Jets and the Giants -- to give out at the church where she volunteered.  A Republican, she took a liking to Gabby, and wanted to get to know her better. Dorwan and Mavy Stoddard grew up in Tucson together - about 70 years ago.  They moved apart and started their own respective families.  But after both were widowed they found their way back here, to, as one of Mavys daughters put it, be boyfriend and girlfriend again. When they werent out on the road in their motor home, you could find them just up the road, helping folks in need at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ.  A retired construction worker, Dorwan spent his spare time fixing up the church along with his dog, Tux.  His final act of selflessness was to dive on top of his wife, sacrificing his life for hers. Everything -- everything -- Gabe Zimmerman did, he did with passion.  But his true passion was helping people.  As Gabbys outreach director, he made the cares of thousands of her constituents his own, seeing to it that seniors got the Medicare benefits that they had earned, that veterans got the medals and the care that they deserved, that government was working for ordinary folks.  He died doing what he loved - talking with people and seeing how he could help.  And Gabe is survived by his parents, Ross and Emily, his brother, Ben, and his fiance, Kelly, who he planned to marry next year. And then there is nine-year-old Christina Taylor Green.  Christina was an A student; she was a dancer; she was a gymnast; she was a swimmer.  She decided that she wanted to be the first woman to play in the Major Leagues, and as the only girl on her Little League team, no one put it past her. She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age.  Shed remind her mother, We are so blessed.  We have the best life.  And shed pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate. Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing.  Our hearts are broken - and yet, our hearts also have reason for fullness. Our hearts are full of hope and thanks for the 13 Americans who survived the shooting, including the congresswoman many of them went to see on Saturday.  I have just come from the University Medical Center, just a mile from here, where our friend Gabby courageously fights to recover even as we speak.  And I want to tell you -- her husband Mark is here and he allows me to share this with you -- right after we went to visit, a few minutes after we left her room and some of her colleagues in Congress were in the room, Gabby opened her eyes for the first time. Gabby opened her eyes for the first time. Gabby opened her eyes.  Gabby opened her eyes, so I can tell you she knows we are here.  She knows we love her.  And she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey.  We are there for her. Our hearts are full of thanks for that good news, and our hearts are full of gratitude for those who saved others.  We are grateful to Daniel Hernandez -- a volunteer in Gabbys office. And, Daniel, Im sorry, you may deny it, but weve decided you are a hero because -- you ran through the chaos to minister to your boss, and tended to her wounds and helped keep her alive. We are grateful to the men who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload.  Right over there.  We are grateful for petite Patricia Maisch, who wrestled away the killers ammunition, and undoubtedly saved some lives. And we are grateful for the doctors and nurses and first responders who worked wonders to heal those whod been hurt.  We are grateful to them. These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle.  They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength.  Heroism is here, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, all around us, just waiting to be summoned - as it was on Saturday morning. Their actions, their selflessness poses a challenge to each of us.  It raises a question of what, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward.  How can we honor the fallen?  How can we be true to their memory? You see, when a tragedy like this strikes, it is part of our nature to demand explanations - to try and pose some order on the chaos and make sense out of that which seems senseless.  Already weve seen a national conversation commence, not only about the motivations behind these killings, but about everything from the merits of gun safety laws to the adequacy of our mental health system.  And much of this process, of debating what might be done to prevent such tragedies in the future, is an essential ingredient in our exercise of self-government. But at a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized - at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who happen to think differently than we do - its important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that were talking with each other in a way that heals, not in a way that wounds. Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world, and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding. In the words of Job, When I looked for light, then came darkness.  Bad things happen, and we have to guard against simple explanations in the aftermath. For the truth is none of us can know exactly what triggered this vicious attack.  None of us can know with any certainty what might have stopped these shots from being fired, or what thoughts lurked in the inner recesses of a violent mans mind.  Yes, we have to examine all the facts behind this tragedy.  We cannot and will not be passive in the face of such violence.  We should be willing to challenge old assumptions in order to lessen the prospects of such violence in the future. But what we cannot do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on each other. That we cannot do.  That we cannot do. As we discuss these issues, let each of us do so with a good dose of humility.  Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame, lets use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations, to listen to each other more carefully, to sharpen our instincts for empathy and remind ourselves of all the ways that our hopes and dreams are bound together. After all, thats what most of us do when we lose somebody in our family - especially if the loss is unexpected.  Were shaken out of our routines.  Were forced to look inward.  We reflect on the past:  Did we spend enough time with an aging parent, we wonder.  Did we express our gratitude for all the sacrifices that they made for us?  Did we tell a spouse just how desperately we loved them, not just once in a while but every single day?", "filename": "12January2011TucsonMemorialServiceSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year that Ive come here to report on the State of the Union.  And for this final one, Im going to try to make it shorter.  I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. (I've been there. I'll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips.) Now, I understand that because its an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low.  But Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families.  So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities -- like criminal justice reform, and helping -- and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So, who knows, we might just surprise the cynics again. But tonight, I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Dont worry, Ive got plenty -- from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system; protecting our kids from gun violence; equal pay for equal work; paid leave; raising the minimum wage. All these things -- All these things still matter to hardworking families. Theyre still the right thing to do, and I wont let up until they get done. But for my final address to this chamber, I dont want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next five years, the next ten years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future. We live in a time of extraordinary change -- change thats reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. Its change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises education for girls in the most remote villages but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. Its change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate. America's been through big changes before -- wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future, who claimed we could slam the brakes on change, who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to \"the dogmas of the quiet past.\"1 Instead we thought anew and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending Americas promise outward -- to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity where there -- where others others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before. What was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation, our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law -- these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come. In fact, its in that spirit that we have made the progress these past seven years. Thats how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. Thats how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector. Thats how -- Thats how we -- Thats how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans. Thats how we -- Thats -- Thats how we secured the freedom in every state to marry the person we love. But -- But such progress is not inevitable. Its the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear -- turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, and the incredible things that we can do together? So lets talk about the future, and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress. First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? And finally, how can we make our politics reflect whats best in us, and not whats worst? Let me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. Were in the middle of the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history -- more than 14 million new jobs, the strongest two years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. Thats just part of a manufacturing surge thats created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past six years. And weve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. Anyone claiming that Americas economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Now -- What is true, and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious, is that the economy has been changing in profound ways -- changes that started long before the Great Recession hit, changes that have not let up. Today, technology doesnt just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top. All these trends have squeezed workers -- even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. Its made it harder for a hardworking family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are [sic] unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot. For the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. Weve made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that weve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree. We agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start. And together weve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing Pre-K for all and offering every student -- offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids. And -- And we have to make college affordable for every American. No hardworking student should be stuck in the red. Weve already reduced student loan payments by -- to 10 percent of a borrowers income, and thats good. But now weve actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing two years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and Im going to keep fighting to get that started this year. Its the right thing to do. But a great education isnt all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. Its not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job in the same place with a health and a retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this chamber. For everyone else, especially folks in their 40s and 50s, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool; they may have to retrain; but they shouldnt loose what theyve already worked so hard to build in the process. Thats why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldnt weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. Its about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job, or you go back to school, or you strike out and launch that new business youll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far, and in the process -- in the process health care inflation has slowed, our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law. Now, Im guessing we wont agree on health care anytime soon. But -- (a little applause right there; just a guess) -- But there should be other ways parties can work together improve economic security. Say a hardworking American loses his job, we shouldnt just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance. We should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business thats ready to hire him. If that new job doesnt pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if hes going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. Thats the way we make the new economy work better for everybody. I also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up, and Id welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support -- like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who dont have children. But there are some areas where we just have to be honest: It has been more difficult to find agreement over the last seven years, and a lot of them fall under the category of what role the government should play in making sure the systems not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And its an honest disagreement. And the American people have a choice to make. I believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is red tape that needs to be cut. (There you go. Yeah. See?) But after years now of record corporate profits, working families wont get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody elses expense. The middle -- Middle-class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collect -- collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food Stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis -- recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants arent the principal reason wages havent gone up. Those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. Its sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. The point is, I believe, that in this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And Im not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses whove figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders. And I want to spread those best practices across America. Thats part of a brighter future. In fact, it turns out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges? Sixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didnt deny Sputnik was up there. We didnt argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight, and twelve years later we were walking on the moon. Now, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley racing to shape a better future. Thats who we are. And over the past seven years, weve nurtured that spirit. Weve protected an open Internet, and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. Weve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more. You know, last year Vice President Biden said that, with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that theyve had in over a decade. Well, so -- so tonight, Im announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because hes gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, Im putting Joe in charge of mission control. For the loved ones weve all lost, for the families that we can still save, lets make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. (What do you think, Joe? Lets make it happen.) And medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. You will be pretty lonely because youll be debating our military2, most of Americas business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community,3 and 200 nations around the world who agree its a problem and intend to solve it. But -- But even if -- even if the planet wasnt at stake, even if 2014 wasnt the warmest year on record until 2015 turned out to be even hotter -- why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? Listen, seven years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results: In fields from Iowa to Texas wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal, in jobs that pay better than average. Were taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy -- something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, weve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. Gas under two bucks a gallon aint bad either. Now weve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we dont show them where the trends are going. And thats why Im going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st century transportation system. Now, none of this is going to happen overnight. And yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs well create, the money well save, the planet well preserve -- that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve; and its within our grasp. Now, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world, and thats why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere theres a problem. I told you earlier all the talk of Americas economic decline is political hot air. Well so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me -- Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth -- period. Period. Its not even close. Its not even close. Its not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. No nation attacks us directly or our allies because they know thats the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office. And when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us. So its useful to level set here because when we dont we dont make good decisions. Now, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But thats not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and its certainly not because of diminished American strength. In todays world, were threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. The Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria -- client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality. Its up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system; and to do that well it means that weve got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in todays world even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out. But as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages -- they pose an enormous danger to civilians. They have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That -- That is the story ISIL wants to tell. Thats the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We dont need to build them up to show that were serious; and we sure dont need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the worlds largest religions. We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed. And thats exactly what were doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISILs financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, we're taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 air strikes, were taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. Were training, arming and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria. If this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. Take a vote. But the American people should know that, with or without Congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt Americas commitment -- or mine -- to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden. Ask -- Ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits. Our foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it cant stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world -- in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America and Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite but it doesnt pass muster on the world stage. We also cant try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis -- even if its done with the best of intentions. Thats not leadership; thats a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. Its the lesson of Vietnam. Its the lesson of Iraq -- and we should have learned it by now. Now, fortunately there is a smarter approach -- a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies; but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us -- and make sure other countries pull their own weight. Thats our approach to conflicts like Syria, where were partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace. Thats why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran; and as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war. Thats how -- Thats how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, our development workers -- they were heroic. They set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands -- maybe [a] couple million -- lives were saved. Thats how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets, and protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region -- we do. You want to show our strength in this new century?", "filename": "12January2016FinalPresidentialStateoftheUnionAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Youre welcome. I want to give a special thanks to Steven Knapp, the president of GW.  I just saw him -- where is he?", "filename": "13April2011SpeechonImprovingFiscalPolicy.txt"}, {"question": "Now, at certain times - particularly during war or recession - our nation has had to borrow money to pay for some of our priorities.  And as most families understand, a little credit card debt isnt going to hurt if its temporary. But as far back as the 1980s, America started amassing debt at more alarming levels, and our leaders began to realize that a larger challenge was on the horizon.  They knew that eventually, the Baby Boom generation would retire, which meant a much bigger portion of our citizens would be relying on programs like Medicare, Social Security, and possibly Medicaid.  Like parents with young children who know they have to start saving for the college years, America had to start borrowing less and saving more to prepare for the retirement of an entire generation.  To meet this challenge, our leaders came together three times during the 1990s to reduce our nations deficit -- three times.  They forged historic agreements that required tough decisions made by the first President Bush, then made by President Clinton, by Democratic Congresses and by a Republican Congress.  All three agreements asked for shared responsibility and shared sacrifice.  But they largely protected the middle class; they largely protected our commitment to seniors; they protected our key investments in our future.  As a result of these bipartisan efforts, Americas finances were in great shape by the year 2000.  We went from deficit to surplus.  America was actually on track to becoming completely debt free, and we were prepared for the retirement of the Baby Boomers.  But after Democrats and Republicans committed to fiscal discipline during the 1990s, we lost our way in the decade that followed.  We increased spending dramatically for two wars and an expensive prescription drug program - but we didnt pay for any of this new spending.  Instead, we made the problem worse with trillions of dollars in unpaid-for tax cuts - tax cuts that went to every millionaire and billionaire in the country; tax cuts that will force us to borrow an average of $500 billion every year over the next decade.  To give you an idea of how much damage this caused to our nations checkbook, consider this:  In the last decade, if we had simply found a way to pay for the tax cuts and the prescription drug benefit, our deficit would currently be at low historical levels in the coming years.  But thats not what happened.  And so, by the time I took office, we once again found ourselves deeply in debt and unprepared for a Baby Boom retirement that is now starting to take place.  When I took office, our projected deficit, annually, was more than $1 trillion.  On top of that, we faced a terrible financial crisis and a recession that, like most recessions, led us to temporarily borrow even more.  In this case, we took a series of emergency steps that saved millions of jobs, kept credit flowing, and provided working families extra money in their pocket.  It was absolutely the right thing to do, but these steps were expensive, and added to our deficits in the short term. So thats how our fiscal challenge was created.  Thats how we got here.  And now that our economic recovery is gaining strength, Democrats and Republicans must come together and restore the fiscal responsibility that served us so well in the 1990s.  We have to live within our means.  We have to reduce our deficit, and we have to get back on a path that will allow us to pay down our debt.  And we have to do it in a way that protects the recovery, protects the investments we need to grow, create jobs, and helps us win the future. Now, before I get into how we can achieve this goal, some of you, particularly the younger people here -- you don't qualify, Joe.  Some of you might be wondering, Why is this so important?  Why does this matter to me?", "filename": "13April2011SpeechonImprovingFiscalPolicy.txt"}, {"question": "Now, up till now, the debate here in Washington, the cuts proposed by a lot of folks in Washington, have focused exclusively on that 12 percent.  But cuts to that 12 percent alone wont solve the problem.  So any serious plan to tackle our deficit will require us to put everything on the table, and take on excess spending wherever it exists in the budget.  A serious plan doesnt require us to balance our budget overnight - in fact, economists think that with the economy just starting to grow again, we need a phased-in approach - but it does require tough decisions and support from our leaders in both parties now.  Above all, it will require us to choose a vision of the America we want to see five years, 10 years, 20 years down the road.  Now, to their credit, one vision has been presented and championed by Republicans in the House of Representatives and embraced by several of their partys presidential candidates.  Its a plan that aims to reduce our deficit by $4 trillion over the next 10 years, and one that addresses the challenge of Medicare and Medicaid in the years after that.  These are both worthy goals.  Theyre worthy goals for us to achieve.  But the way this plan achieves those goals would lead to a fundamentally different America than the one weve known certainly in my lifetime.  In fact, I think it would be fundamentally different than what weve known throughout our history.  A 70 percent cut in clean energy.  A 25 percent cut in education.  A 30 percent cut in transportation.  Cuts in college Pell Grants that will grow to more than $1,000 per year.  Thats the proposal.  These arent the kind of cuts you make when youre trying to get rid of some waste or find extra savings in the budget.  These arent the kinds of cuts that the Fiscal Commission proposed.  These are the kinds of cuts that tell us we cant afford the America that I believe in and I think you believe in.  I believe it paints a vision of our future that is deeply pessimistic.  Its a vision that says if our roads crumble and our bridges collapse, we cant afford to fix them.  If there are bright young Americans who have the drive and the will but not the money to go to college, we cant afford to send them.  Go to China and youll see businesses opening research labs and solar facilities.  South Korean children are outpacing our kids in math and science.  Theyre scrambling to figure out how they put more money into education.  Brazil is investing billions in new infrastructure and can run half their cars not on high-priced gasoline, but on biofuels.  And yet, we are presented with a vision that says the American people, the United States of America - the greatest nation on Earth - cant afford any of this.  Its a vision that says America cant afford to keep the promise weve made to care for our seniors.  It says that 10 years from now, if youre a 65-year-old whos eligible for Medicare, you should have to pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today.  It says instead of guaranteed health care, you will get a voucher.  And if that voucher isnt worth enough to buy the insurance thats available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck - youre on your own.  Put simply, it ends Medicare as we know it.  Its a vision that says up to 50 million Americans have to lose their health insurance in order for us to reduce the deficit.  Who are these 50 million Americans?  Many are somebodys grandparents -- may be one of yours -- who wouldnt be able to afford nursing home care without Medicaid.  Many are poor children.  Some are middle-class families who have children with autism or Downs syndrome.  Some of these kids with disabilities are -- the disabilities are so severe that they require 24-hour care.  These are the Americans wed be telling to fend for themselves.        And worst of all, this is a vision that says even though Americans cant afford to invest in education at current levels, or clean energy, even though we cant afford to maintain our commitment on Medicare and Medicaid, we can somehow afford more than $1 trillion in new tax breaks for the wealthy.  Think about that. In the last decade, the average income of the bottom 90 percent of all working Americans actually declined.  Meanwhile, the top 1 percent saw their income rise by an average of more than a quarter of a million dollars each.  Thats who needs to pay less taxes?", "filename": "13April2011SpeechonImprovingFiscalPolicy.txt"}, {"question": "So this summit is an example of what we need more of -- all of us working together to do what none of us can achieve alone.  And it is difficult.  Some of the challenges Ive described today have defied solutions for years.  And I want to say very clearly that, as somebody who is a former constitutional law teacher, and somebody who deeply values his privacy and his familys privacy -- although I chose the wrong job for that -- but will be a private citizen again, and cares deeply about this -- I have to tell you that grappling with how government protects the American people from adverse events while, at the same time, making sure that government itself is not abusing its capabilities is hard.  The cyber world is sort of the wild, wild West.  And to some degree, we're asked to be the sheriff.  When something like Sony happens, people want to know what can government do about this.  If information is being shared by terrorists in the cyber world and an attack happens, people want to know are there ways of stopping that from happening.  By necessity, that means government has its own significant capabilities in the cyber world.  But then people, rightly, ask, well, what safeguards do we have against government intruding on our own privacy?  And it's hard, and it constantly evolves because the technology so often outstrips whatever rules and structures and standards have been put in place, which means that government has to be constantly self-critical and we have to be able to have an open debate about it.    But were all here today because we know that we're going to have to break through some of these barriers that are holding us back if we are going to continue to thrive in this remarkable new world.  We all know what we need to do.  We have to build stronger defenses and disrupt more attacks.  We have to make cyberspace safer.  We have to improve cooperation across the board.  And, by the way, this is not just here in America, but internationally -- which also, by the way, makes things complicated because a lot of countries don't necessarily share our investment -- or our commitment to openness, and we have to try to navigate that. But this should not be an ideological issue.  And thats one thing I want to emphasize:  This is not a Democratic issue, or a Republican issue.  This is not a liberal or conservative issue.  Everybody is online, and everybody is vulnerable.  The business leaders here want their privacy and their children protected, just like the consumer and privacy advocates here want America to keep leading the world in technology and be safe from attacks.  So Im hopeful that through this forum and the work that we do subsequently, that we're able to generate ideas and best practices, and that the work of this summit can help guide our planning and execution for years to come.  After all, we are just getting started.  Think about it.  Tim Berners-Lee, from his lab in Switzerland, invented the World Wide Web in 1989, which was only 26 years ago.  The great epochs in human history -- the Bronze Age, Iron Age, Agricultural Revolution, Industrial Revolution -- they spanned centuries.  Were only 26 years into this Internet Age.  Weve only scratched the surface.  And as I guess they say at Google, The future is awesome.  We havent even begun to imagine the discoveries and innovations that are going to be unleashed in the decades to come.  But we know how well get there.  Reflecting on his work in the 1960s on ARPANET, the precursor of the Internet, the late Paul Baran said this:  The process of technological developments is like building a cathedral.  Over the course of several hundred years, new people come along and each lays down a block on top of the old foundations, each saying, I built the cathedral.  And then comes along an historian who asks, Well, who built the cathedral?", "filename": "13February2015StanfordUniversityCybersecuritySummitAddress.txt"}, {"question": "But in advance of my State of the Union address next week, Ive been rolling out my proposals for keeping our economy on track, keeping it growing, making sure we're creating jobs and opportunity for the American people.  And that includes the extraordinary opportunities that exist in our digital economy. Yesterday, I announced new proposals to better protect Americans from identity theft and to ensure our privacy, including making sure that our kids are safe from digital marketing and intrusions on their privacy based on what theyre doing at school.  Tomorrow in Iowa, Ill talk about how we can give more families and communities faster, cheaper access to the broadband that allows them to successfully compete in this global economy.  And on Thursday, the Vice President will be in Norfolk to highlight the need to continue to invest in the education and skills for our cybersecurity professionals.  But today I am here at DHS to highlight how we can work with the private sector to better protect American companies against cyber threats.  Shortly after I took office, I declared that cyber threats pose an enormous challenge for our country.  It's one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.  Foreign governments, criminals and hackers probe Americas computer networks every single day.  We saw that again with the attack at Sony, which actually destroyed data and computer hardware that is going to be very costly for that company to clean up.  Just yesterday, we saw the hack of a military Twitter account and You Tube channel.  No military operations were impacted.  So far, it appears that no classified information was released.  But the investigation is ongoing, and its a reminder that cyber threats are an urgent and growing danger. Moreover, much of our critical infrastructure -- our financial systems, power grids, pipelines, health care systems --run on networks connected to the Internet.  So this is a matter of public safety and of public health.  And most of this infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector.  So neither government, nor the private sector can defend the nation alone.  Its going to have to be a shared mission -- government and industry working hand in hand, as partners. And thats why Ive said that protecting our digital infrastructure is a national security priority and a national economic priority.  Over the past six years, weve pursued a comprehensive strategy, boosting our defenses in government, sharing more information with the private sector to help them defend themselves, working with industry through what we call the Cybersecurity Framework not just to respond to threats and recover from attacks but to prevent and disrupt them in the first place.   And thats where these good folks come in.  We are currently at the National Cybersecurity Communications Integration Center  -- also known as NCCIC.  I just got a tour and a briefing.  I want to thank everybody here, not just from DHS but from across government and the private sector, because, again, this is a shared responsibility.  This center is one of the critical lines of Americas cyber defenses.  These men and women work around the clock, 24/7, monitoring threats, issuing warnings, sharing information with the private sector, and keeping Americans safe.  So, as a nation, we owe them thanks, and as a nation, we are making progress.  Were more prepared to defend against cyber attacks.  But every day, our adversaries are getting more sophisticated and more determined, and more plentiful.  So every day, weve got to keep upping our game at the same time.  Weve got to stay ahead of those who are trying to do us harm. The problem is that government and the private sector are still not always working as closely together as we should.  Sometimes its still too hard for government to share threat information with companies.  Sometimes its still too hard for companies to share information about cyber threats with the government.  There are legal issues involved and liability issues.  Sometimes, companies are reluctant to reveal their vulnerabilities or admit publicly that they have been hacked.  At the same time, the American people have a legitimate interest in making sure that government is not potentially abusing information that it's received from the private sector.  So all of us -- government and industry -- are going to have to keep doing better.  The new legislation and proposals I put forward yesterday will help, especially for a strong, single national standard for notifying Americans when their information has been breached.  Today, I want to announce some additional steps. First, were proposing new cybersecurity legislation to promote the greater information sharing we need between government and the private sector.  This builds and improves upon legislation that weve put forward in the past.  It reflects years of extensive discussions with industry.  It includes liability protections for companies that share information on cyber threats.  It includes essential safeguards to ensure that government protects privacy and civil liberties even as we're doing our job of safeguarding Americas critical information networks.  I raised this issue again and the need for this legislation with congressional leaders this morning, including Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell, and we all agree that this is a threat that has to be addressed, and I am confident that we should be able to craft bipartisan legislation soon to put these systems in place.  Were going to keep on working with Congress to get this done.  And in the meantime, were going to do everything we can with our existing authorities to make sure industry gets the information it needs to better defend itself. Second, were proposing to update the authorities that law enforcement uses to go after cyber criminals.  We want to be able to better prosecute those who are involved in cyber attacks, those who are involved in the sale of cyber weapons like botnets and spyware.  We want to ensure that were able to prosecute insiders who steal corporate secrets or individuals private information.  And we want to expand the authority of courts to shut down botnets and other malware.  The bottom line, we want cyber criminals to feel the full force of American justice, because they are doing as much damage, if not more, these days as folks who are involved in more conventional crime. Finally, and since this is a challenge that we can only meet together, Im announcing that next month well convene a White House summit on cybersecurity and consumer protection.  Its a White House summit where we're not going to do it at the White House; we're going to go to Stanford University.  And its going to bring everybody together -- industry, tech companies, law enforcement, consumer and privacy advocates, law professors who are specialists in the field, as well as students -- to make sure that we work through these issues in a public, transparent fashion.    Because theyre hard and theyre complicated issues.  But if we keep on working on them together, and focus on concrete and pragmatic steps that we can take to boost our cybersecurity and our privacy, I'm confident that both our privacy will be more secure and our information, our networks, public health, public safety will be more secure.  Were going to keep on at this as a government, but we're also going to be working with the private sector to detect, prevent, defend, deter against attacks, and to recover quickly from any disruptions or damage.  And as long as Im President, protecting Americas digital infrastructure is going to remain a top national security priority.  In closing, I want to say one of the areas Ill be working with Congress is to ensure that we dont let any disagreements keep us from fulfilling our most basic responsibilities.  Last weeks attack in Paris was a painful reminder that we have no greater duty than the security of the American people.  And our national security should never be subject to partisan political games.  Congress needs to fully fund our Department of Homeland Security, without delay, so that the dedicated public servants working here can operate with the certainty and confidence they need to keep the American people safe.  And that's true across the board in the Department of Homeland Security.  So, again, I want to thank Jeh and Deputy Secretary Mayorkas, and everybody here at NCCIC and DHS for the great job you are doing.  You are helping to keep the nation safe and secure.  And with that, we're going to get out of here so you can get back to work.  Who knows whats been happening while youve been paying attention to me? All right?", "filename": "13January2015NationalCybersecurityCommunicationCenterAddress.txt"}, {"question": "This is an attack not just on Paris, its an attack not just on the people of France, but this is an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share. We stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance that the government and the people of France need to respond.  France is our oldest ally.  The French people have stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States time and again.  And we want to be very clear that we stand together with them in the fight against terrorism and extremism. Paris itself represents the timeless values of human progress.  Those who think that they can terrorize the people of France or the values that they stand for are wrong.  The American people draw strength from the French peoples commitment to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. We are reminded in this time of tragedy that the bonds of libert and galit and fraternit are not only values that the French people care so deeply about, but they are values that we share.  And those values are going to endure far beyond any act of terrorism or the hateful vision of those who perpetrated the crimes this evening. Were going to do whatever it takes to work with the French people and with nations around the world to bring these terrorists to justice, and to go after any terrorist networks that go after our people. We dont yet know all the details of what has happened.  We have been in contact with French officials to communicate our deepest condolences to the families of those who have been killed, to offer our prayers and thoughts to those who have been wounded.  We have offered our full support to them. The situation is still unfolding.  Ive chosen not to call President Hollande at this time, because my expectation is that hes very busy at the moment.  I actually, by coincidence, was talking to him earlier today in preparation for the G20 meeting.  But I am confident that Ill be in direct communications with him in the next few days, and well be coordinating in any ways that they think are helpful in the investigation of whats happened. This is a heartbreaking situation.  And obviously those of us here in the United States know what its like.  Weve gone through these kinds of episodes ourselves.  And whenever these kinds of attacks happened, weve always been able to count on the French people to stand with us.  They have been an extraordinary counterterrorism partner, and we intend to be there with them in that same fashion. Im sure that in the days ahead well learn more about exactly what happened, and my teams will make sure that we are in communication with the press to provide you accurate information.  I dont want to speculate at this point in terms of who was responsible for this.  It appears that there may still be live activity and dangers that are taking place as we speak.  And so until we know from French officials that the situation is under control, and we have for more information about it, I dont want to speculate.

That's a mistake and it's one that we'll help to correct.  Through this fund, schools will have the chance to borrow at a more affordable rate to modernize facilities, and they'll be building on the funds in the recovery plan that are already helping to renovate schools, including community colleges all across the country.  And by the way, not only does this improve the schools and the training that they're providing, guess what?", "filename": "14 July 2009\t American Graduation Initiative Speech.txt"}, {"question": "Its been a busy and productive four years.  And I expect the same for the next four years.  I intend to carry out the agenda that I campaigned on -- an agenda for new jobs, new opportunity, and new security for the middle class.  Right now, our economy is growing, and our businesses are creating new jobs, so we are poised for a good year if we make smart decisions and sound investments -- and as long as Washington politics dont get in the way of Americas progress. As I said on the campaign, one component to growing our economy and broadening opportunity for the middle class is shrinking our deficits in a balanced and responsible way.  And for nearly two years now, Ive been fighting for such a plan -- one that would reduce our deficits by $4 trillion over the next decade, which would stabilize our debt and our deficit in a sustainable way for the next decade.  That would be enough not only to stop the growth of our debt relative to the size of our economy, but it would make it manageable so it doesnt crowd out the investments we need to make in people and education and job training and science and medical research -- all the things that help us grow. Now, step by step, weve made progress towards that goal.  Over the past two years, Ive signed into law about $1.4 trillion in spending cuts.  Two weeks ago, I signed into law more than $600 billion in new revenue by making sure the wealthiest Americans begin to pay their fair share.  When you add the money that well save in interest payments on the debt, all together that adds up to a total of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the past two years -- not counting the $400 billion already saved from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  So we've made progress.  We are moving towards our ultimate goal of getting to a $4 trillion reduction.  And there will be more deficit reduction when Congress decides what to do about the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that have been pushed off until next month.  The fact is, though, we cant finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone.  The cuts weve already made to priorities other than Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and defense mean that we spend on everything from education to public safety less as a share of our economy than it has -- than has been true for a generation.  And thats not a recipe for growth. So weve got to do more both to stabilize our finances over the medium and long term, but also spur more growth in the short term.  Ive said Im open to making modest adjustments to programs like Medicare to protect them for future generations.  Ive also said that we need more revenue through tax reform by closing loopholes in our tax code for the wealthiest Americans.  If we combine a balanced package of savings from spending on health care and revenues from closing loopholes, we can solve the deficit issue without sacrificing our investments in things like education that are going to help us grow. It turns out the American people agree with me.  They listened to an entire years debate over this issue, and they made a clear decision about the approach they prefer.  They dont think its fair, for example, to ask a senior to pay more for his or her health care, or a scientist to shut down lifesaving research so that a multimillionaire investor can pay less in tax rates than a secretary.  They dont think its smart to protect endless corporate loopholes and tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans rather than rebuild our roads and our schools, invest in our workers skills, or help manufacturers bring jobs back to America.  So they want us to get our books in order in a balanced way, where everybody pulls their weight, everyone does their part. That's what I want as well.  That's what I've proposed.  And we can get it done, but we're going to have to make sure that people are looking at this in a responsible way rather than just through the lens of politics. Now, the other congressionally imposed deadline coming up is the so-called debt ceiling -- something most Americans hadnt even heard of before two years ago.  I want to be clear about this.  The debt ceiling is not a question of authorizing more spending.  Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending.  It simply allows the country to pay for spending that Congress has already committed to.  These are bills that have already been racked up and we need to pay them.  So while Im willing to compromise and find common ground over how to reduce our deficits, America cannot afford another debate with this Congress about whether or not they should pay the bills theyve already racked up.  If congressional Republicans refuse to pay Americas bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans benefits will be delayed.  We might not be able to pay our troops, or honor our contracts with small business owners.  Food inspectors, air traffic controllers, specialists who track down loose nuclear material wouldnt get their paychecks.  Investors around the world will ask if the United States of America is, in fact, a safe bet.  Markets could go haywire.  Interest rates would spike for anybody who borrows money -- every homeowner with a mortgage, every student with a college loan, every small business owner who wants to grow and hire.  It would be a self-inflicted wound on the economy.  It would slow down our growth, might tip us into recession, and ironically, would probably increase our deficit.  So to even entertain the idea of this happening -- of the United States of America not paying its bills -- is irresponsible.  Its absurd.  As the Speaker said two years ago, it would be -- and I'm quoting Speaker Boehner now -- a financial disaster, not only for us, but for the worldwide economy.  So we've got to pay our bills.  And Republicans in Congress have two choices here:  They can act responsibly, and pay Americas bills; or they can act irresponsibly, and put America through another economic crisis.  But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy.  The financial well-being of the American people is not leverage to be used.  The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not a bargaining chip.  And they better choose quickly, because time is running short.  The last time Republicans in Congress even flirted with this idea, our AAA credit rating was downgraded for the first time in our history; our businesses created the fewest jobs of any month in nearly the past three years; and, ironically, the whole fiasco actually added to the deficit.  So it shouldnt be surprising, given all this talk, that the American people think Washington is hurting, rather than helping, the country at the moment.  They see their representatives consumed with partisan brinksmanship over paying our bills, while they overwhelmingly want us to focus on growing the economy and creating more jobs.  So lets finish this debate.  Lets give our businesses and the world the certainty that our economy and our reputation are still second to none.  We pay our bills.  We handle our business. And then we can move on -- because America has a lot to do.  Weve got to create more jobs.  We've got to boost the wages of those who have work.  Weve got to reach for energy independence. We've got to reform our immigration system.  Weve got to give our children the best education possible, and we've got to do everything we can to protect them from the horrors of gun violence.  And let me say Im grateful to Vice President Biden for his work on this issue of gun violence and for his proposals, which I'm going to be reviewing today and I will address in the next few days and I intend to vigorously pursue. So, with that, I'm going to take some questions.  And I'm going to start with Julie Pace of AP.  And I want to congratulate Julie for this new, important job.   Question:  Thank you very much. President Obama:  Yes. Question:   I wanted to ask about gun violence.  Today marks the one-year -- or one-month anniversary of the shooting in Newtown, which seemed to generate some momentum for reinstating the assault weapons ban.  But theres been fresh opposition to that ban from the NRA.  And even Harry Reid has said that he questions whether it could pass Congress.  Given that, how hard will you push for an assault weapons ban?  And if one cannot pass Congress, what other measures would need to be included in a broad package in order to curb gun violence successfully? President Obama:  Well, as I said, the Vice President and a number of members of my Cabinet went through a very thorough process over the last month, meeting with a lot of stakeholders in this including the NRA, listened to proposals from all quarters, and theyve presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn't happen again. Im going to be meeting with the Vice President today.  I expect to have a fuller presentation later in the week to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do.  My starting point is not to worry about the politics; my starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works; what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that were reducing the incidents of gun violence.  And I think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the Second Amendment.  And then members of Congress I think are going to have to have a debate and examine their own conscience -- because if, in fact -- and I believe this is true -- everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then were going to have to vote based on what we think is best.  Were going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside.  And that's what I expect Congress to do. But what you can count is, is that the things that Ive said in the past -- the belief that we have to have stronger background checks, that we can do a much better job in terms of keeping these magazine clips with high capacity out of the hands of folks who shouldnt have them, an assault weapons ban that is meaningful -- that those are things I continue to believe make sense.  Will all of them get through this Congress?  I dont know.  But whats uppermost in my mind is making sure that Im honest with the American people and with members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is something that will make a difference.  And to repeat what Ive said earlier -- if there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step. Question:  Can a package be discussed to allow an assault weapons ban? President Obama:  Ill present the details later in the week. Chuck Todd, NBC. Question:  Thank you, sir.  As you know, the Senate Democrats, Harry Reid sent you a letter begging you, essentially, to take -- consider some sort of executive action on this debt ceiling issue.  I know youve said youre not negotiating on it.  Your administration has ruled out the various ideas that have been out there -- the 14th Amendment.  But just this morning, one of the House Democratic leaders, Jim Clyburn, asked you to use the 14th Amendment and even said, sometimes thats what it takes.  He brought up the Emancipation Proclamation as saying it took executive action when Congress wouldnt act, and he compared the debt ceiling to that.  So are you considering a plan B, and if not, why not? President Obama:  Well, Chuck, the issue here is whether or not America pays its bills.  We are not a deadbeat nation.  And so theres a very simple solution to this:  Congress authorizes us to pay our bills.  Now, if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they dont have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, Im happy to take it.  Mitch McConnell, the Republican Leader in the Senate, had a proposal like that last year, and Im happy to accept it.  But if they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done.  And there are no magic tricks here.  There are no loopholes. There are no easy outs.  This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending.  They order me to spend.  They tell me, you need to fund our Defense Department at such and such a level; you need to send out Social Security checks; you need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.  They lay all this out for me because they have the spending power.  And so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills.  Separately, they also have to authorize the raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid.  And so, what Congress can't do is tell me to spend X, and then say, but we're not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.  And I just want to repeat -- because I think sometimes the American people, understandably, aren't following all the debates here in Washington -- raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more.  All it does is say that America will pay its bills.  And we are not a dead-beat nation.  And the consequences of us not paying our bills, as I outlined in my opening statement, would be disastrous.  So I understand the impulse to try to get around this in a simple way.  But there's one way to get around this.  There's one way to deal with it.  And that is for Congress to authorize me to pay for those items of spending that they have already authorized. And the notion that Republicans in the House, or maybe some Republicans in the Senate, would suggest that in order for us to get our way on our spending priorities, that we would risk the full faith and credit of the United States -- that I think is not what the Founders intended.  That's not how I think most Americans think our democracy should work.  They've got a point of view; Democrats in Congress have a point of view.  They need to sit down and work out a compromise. Question:  You just outlined an entire rationale for why this can't happen. President Obama:  Yes. Question:  And if -- then if -- and you're not negotiating on the debt ceiling. President Obama:  Yes. Question:  So you're not negotiating and they say you have to negotiate, and you're not considering another plan B, then do you just wait it out and we do go -- we do see all these things happen? President Obama:  Well look, Chuck, there are -- there's a pretty straightforward way of doing this and that is to set the debt ceiling aside, we pay our bills, and then we have a vigorous debate about how we're going to do further deficit reduction in a balanced way. Keep in mind that what we've heard from some Republicans in both the House and the Senate is that they will only increase the debt ceiling by the amount of spending cuts that they're able to push through and -- in order to replace the automatic spending cuts of the sequester -- that's $1.2 trillion.  Say it takes another trillion or trillion-two to get us through one more year, they'd have to identify $2.5 trillion in cuts just to get the debt ceiling extended to next year -- $2.5 trillion.  They can't even -- Congress has not been able to identify $1.2 trillion in cuts that they're happy with.  Because these same Republicans say they dont want to cut defense; they've claimed that they don't want to gut Medicare or harm the vulnerable.  But the truth of the matter is that you can't meet their own criteria without drastically cutting Medicare, or having an impact on Medicaid, or affecting our defense spending. So the math just doesnt add up. Now, heres what would work.  What would work would be for us to say weve already done close to $2 trillion in deficit reduction, and if you add the interest that we wont be paying because of less spending and increased revenue, it adds up to about $2.5 trillion.  The consensus is we need about $4 trillion to stabilize our debt and our deficit, which means we need about $1.5 trillion more.  The package that I offered to Speaker Boehner before we -- before the New Year would achieve that.  We were actually fairly close in terms of arriving at that number. So if the goal is to make sure that we are being responsible about our debt and our deficit, if thats the conversation were having, Im happy to have that conversation.  And by closing some additional loopholes through tax reform -- which Speaker Boehner has acknowledged can raise money in a sensible way -- and by doing some additional cuts, including making sure that we are reducing our health care spending, which is the main driver of our deficits, we can arrive at a package that gets this thing done.  Im happy to have that conversation.  What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people -- the threat that unless we get our way, unless you gut Medicare or Medicaid, or otherwise slash things that the American people dont believe should be slashed, that were going to threaten to wreck the entire economy.  That is not how historically this has been done.  Thats not how were going to do it this time. Question:  No plan B?", "filename": "14January2013FinalFirstTermPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "President Obama:  Well, no, Major, I think if you look at the history, getting votes for the debt ceiling is always difficult, and budgets in this town are always difficult.  I went through this just last year.  But whats different is we never saw a situation as we saw last year in which certain groups in Congress took such an absolutist position that we came within a few days of defaulting.  And the fact of the matter is, is that we have never seen the debt ceiling used in this fashion, where the notion was, you know what, we might default unless we get 100 percent of what we want.  That hasnt happened. Now, as I indicated before, Im happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits further in a sensible way.  Although one thing I want to point out is that the American people are also concerned about how we grow our economy, how we put people back to work, how we make sure that we finance our workers getting properly trained and our schools are giving our kids the education we deserve.  Theres a whole growth agenda which will reduce our deficits thats important as well. But what youve never seen is the notion that has been presented, so far at least, by the Republicans that deficit reduction -- well only count spending cuts; that we will raise the deficit -- or the debt ceiling dollar for dollar on spending cuts.  There are a whole set of rules that have been established that are impossible to meet without doing severe damage to the economy.  And so what were not going to do is put ourselves in a position where in order to pay for spending that weve already incurred, that our two options are were either going to profoundly hurt the economy and hurt middle-class families and hurt seniors and hurt kids who are trying to go to college, or, alternatively, were going to blow up the economy.  Were not going to do that. Question:  [Inaudible] -- open to a one-to-three-month extension to the debt ceiling -- whatever Congress sends you, youre okay with it? President Obama:  No, not whatever Congress sends me.  Theyre going to have to send me something thats sensible.  And we shouldnt be doing this -- Question: -- [inaudible] -- President Obama:  -- and we shouldnt be doing this on a one to three-month timeframe.  Why would we do that?  This is the United States of America, Major.  What, we cant manage our affairs in such a way that we pay our bills and we provide some certainty in terms of how we pay our bills?  Look, I dont think anybody would consider my position unreasonable here.  I have -- Question:  But why does it presuppose the need to negotiate and talk about this on a daily basis?  Because if default is the biggest threat to the economy, why not talk about it -- President Obama:  Major, I am happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits.  Im not going to have a monthly or every-three-months conversation about whether or not we pay our bills.  Because that in and of itself does severe damage.  Even the threat of default hurts our economy.  Its hurting our economy as we speak.  We shouldnt be having that debate.  If we want to have a conversation about how to reduce our deficit, lets have that.  Weve been having that for the last two years.  We just had an entire campaign about it.  And by the way, the American people agreed with me that we should reduce our deficits in a balanced way that also takes into account the need for us to grow this economy and put people back to work. And despite that conversation, and despite the election results, the position thats been taken on the part of some House Republicans is that, no, weve got to do it our way, and if we dont, we simply wont pay Americas bills.  Well, that cant be a position that is sustainable over time.  Its not one that's good for the economy now.  It's certainly not going to be the kind of precedent that I want to establish not just for my presidency, but for future Presidents, even if it was on the other side. Democrats don't like voting for the debt ceiling when a Republican is President, and yet you -- but you never saw a situation in which Democrats suggested somehow that we would go ahead and default if we didn't get 100 percent of our way.  That's just not how it's supposed to work.  Jon Karl. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  On the issue of guns, given how difficult it will be -- some would say impossible -- to get any gun control measure passed through this Congress, what are you willing or able to do, using the powers of your presidency, to act without Congress?  And I'd also like to know, what do you make of these long lines we're seeing at gun shows and gun stores all around the country?  I mean, even in Connecticut, applications for guns are up since the shooting in Newtown. President Obama:  Well, my understanding is the Vice President is going to provide a range of steps that we can take to reduce gun violence.  Some of them will require legislation.  Some of them I can accomplish through executive action.  And so I'll be reviewing those today.  And as I said, I'll speak in more detail to what we're going to go ahead and propose later in the week. But I'm confident that there are some steps that we can take that don't require legislation and that are within my authority as President.  And where you get a step that has the opportunity to reduce the possibility of gun violence then I want to go ahead and take it.  Question:  Any idea of what kind of steps? President Obama:  Well, I think, for example, how we are gathering data, for example, on guns that fall into the hands of criminals, and how we track that more effectively -- there may be some steps that we can take administratively as opposed through legislation.  As far as people lining up and purchasing more guns, I think that we've seen for some time now that those who oppose any common-sense gun control or gun safety measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government is about to take all your guns away.  And there's probably an economic element to that.  It obviously is good for business.  But I think that those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship, they don't have anything to worry about.  The issue here is not whether or not we believe in the Second Amendment.  The issue is, are there some sensible steps that we can take to make sure that somebody like the individual in Newtown can't walk into a school and gun down a bunch of children in a shockingly rapid fashion.  And surely, we can do something about that.  But part of the challenge that we confront is, is that even the slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area fans this notion that somehow, here it comes and everybody's guns are going to be taken away.  It's unfortunate, but that's the case.  And if you look at over the first four years of my administration, weve tried to tighten up and enforce some of the laws that were already on the books.  But it would be pretty hard to argue that somehow gun owners have had their rights infringed. Question:  So you think this is an irrational fear that's driving all these people to go and stock up -- President Obama:  Excuse me? Question:  Do you think this is an irrational fear -- President Obama:  Well, as I said, I think it's a fear that's fanned by those who are worried about the possibility of any legislation getting out there.  Julianna Goldman. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I just want to come back to the debt ceiling, because in the summer of 2011, you said that you wouldn't negotiate on the debt ceiling, and you did.  Last year, you said that you wouldn't extend any of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and you did.  So as you say now that you're not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling this year, why should House Republicans take that seriously and think that if we get to the one-minute-to-midnight scenario, that you're not going to back down? President Obama:  Well, first of all, Julianna, let's take the example of this year and the fiscal cliff.  I didn't say that I would not have any conversations at all about extending the Bush tax cuts.  What I said was we weren't going to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthy -- and we didn't.  Now, you can argue that during the campaign I said -- I set the criteria for wealthy at $250,000 and we ended up being at $400,000.  But the fact of the matter is millionaires, billionaires are paying significantly more in taxes, just as I said.  So from the start, my concern was making sure that we had a tax code that was fair and that protected the middle class, and my biggest priority was making sure that middle-class taxes did not go up.  The difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we've already made $1.2 trillion in cuts.  And at the time, I indicated that there were cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth.  I said at the time I think we should pair it up with revenue in order to have an overall balanced package.  But my own budget reflected cuts in discretionary spending.  My own budget reflected the cuts that needed to be made, and we've made those cuts.  Now, the challenge going forward is that we've now made some big cuts, and if we're going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way.  The alternative is for us to go ahead and cut commitments that we've made on things like Medicare, or Social Security, or Medicaid, and for us to fundamentally change commitments that we've made to make sure that seniors don't go into poverty, or that children who are disabled are properly cared for.  For us to change that contract we've made with the American people rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they don't need, that points to a long-term trend in which we have fundamentally, I think, undermined what people expect out of this government -- which is that parties sit down, they negotiate, they compromise, but they also reflect the will of the American people; that you don't have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time or otherwise threaten that we destroy the American economy. Another way of putting it is we've got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again.  And now is as good of a time as any, at the start of my second term, because if we continue down this path, then there's really no stopping the principle.  I mean, literally -- even in divided government, even where we've got a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate, that a small group in the House of Representatives could simply say every two months, every three months, every six months, every year, we are going to more and more change the economy in ways that we prefer, despite strong objections of Americans all across the country, or otherwise we're going to have America not pay its bills.  And that is no way for us to do business. And by the way, I would make the same argument if it was a Republican President and a Republican Senate and you had a handful of Democrats who were suggesting that we are going to hijack the process and make sure that either we get our way 100 percent of the time, or otherwise we are going to default on Americas obligations. Question:  [Inaudible] -- line in the sand negotiating, how is that [inaudible] to the economy? President Obama:  No, no, look, what Ive said is that Im happy to have a conversation about deficit reduction -- Question:  So you technically are willing to negotiate? President Obama:  No, Julianna, look, this is pretty straightforward.  Either Congress pays its bills or it doesn't.  Now, if -- and they want to keep this responsibility; if John Boehner and Mitch McConnell think that they can come up with a plan that somehow meets their criteria that theyve set for why they will -- when they will raise the debt ceiling, they're free to go ahead and try.  But the proposals that theyve put forward in order to accomplish that -- only by cutting spending -- means cuts to things like Medicare and education that the American people profoundly reject. Now, if they think that they can get that through Congress, then they're free to try.  But I think that a better way of doing this is go ahead and say, were going to pay our bills.  The question now is how do we actually get our deficit in a manageable, sustainable way?  And that's a conversation Im happy to have. All right.  Matt Spetalnick. Question:  Thank you, sir.  Youve spoken extensively about the debt ceiling debate, but some Republicans have further said that they're willing to allow a government shutdown to take place rather than put off deep spending cuts.  Are you prepared to allow the government to grind to a halt if you disagree with the spending cut proposals they put forth?  And who do you think the American people would blame if that came to pass? President Obama:  Well, ultimately, Congress makes the decisions about whether or not we spend money and whether or not we keep this government open.  And if the Republicans in Congress have made a decision that they want to shut down the government in order to get their way then they have the votes at least in the House of Representatives, probably, to do that.  I think that would be a mistake.  I think it would be profoundly damaging to our economy.  I think it would actually add to our deficit because it will impede growth.  I think its shortsighted.  But theyre elected representatives, and folks put them into those positions and theyre going to have to make a decision about that.  And I dont -- I suspect that the American people would blame all of Washington for not being able to get its act together.  But the larger issue here has to do with what is it that were trying to accomplish.  Are we trying to reduce the deficit? Because if were trying to reduce the deficit, then we can shape a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit.  I mean, is that really our objective?  Our concern is that were spending more than we take in, and if thats the case, then theres a way of balancing that out so that we take in more money in increasing revenue and we reduce spending.  And theres a recipe for getting that done. And in the conversations that I had with Speaker Boehner before the end of the year, we came pretty close -- a few hundred billion dollars separating us when stretched over a 10-year period, thats not a lot.  But it seems as if whats motivating and propelling at this point some of the House Republicans is more than simply deficit reduction.  They have a particular vision about what government should and should not do.  So they are suspicious about governments commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security.  They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat, or whether we should be spending money on medical research.  So theyve got a particular view of what government should do and should be.  And that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign.  I think every poll thats out there indicates that the American people actually think our commitment to Medicare or to education is really important, and thats something that we should look at as a last resort in terms of reducing the deficit, and it makes a lot more sense for us to close, for example, corporate loopholes before we go to putting a bigger burden on students or seniors.  But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the government to see if they can get their way on it, thats their prerogative.  Thats how the system is set up.  It will damage our economy.  The government is a big part of this economy, and its interesting that a lot of times you have people who recognize that when it comes to defense spending -- some of the same folks who say weve got to cut spending, or complain that government jobs dont do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is a pretty important part of the economy in my district and we shouldnt stop spending on that.  Lets just make sure were not spending on those other folks. Question:  -- find agreement with Republicans on this and -- President Obama:  Look, my hope is, is that common sense prevails.  Thats always my preference.  And I think that would the preference of the American people, and thats what would be good for the economy. So let me just repeat:  If the issue is deficit reduction, getting our deficits sustainable over time, getting our debt in a sustainable place, then Democrats and Republicans in Congress will have a partner with me.  We can achieve that, and we can achieve it fairly quickly.  I mean, we know what the numbers are.  We know what needs to be done.  We know what a balanced approach would take.  Weve already done probably more than half of the deficit reduction we need to stabilize the debt and the deficit.  Theres probably been more pain and drama in getting there than we needed.  And so finishing the job shouldnt be that difficult -- if everybody comes to the conversation with an open mind, and if we recognize that there are some things, like not paying our bills, that should be out of bounds. All right.  Im going to take one last question.  Jackie Calmes. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama:  Yes. Question:  Id like to ask you, now that youve reached the end of your first term, starting your second, about a couple of criticisms -- one thats longstanding, another more recent.  The longstanding one seems to have become a truism of sorts that youre -- you and your staff are too insular, that you dont socialize enough.  And the second, the more recent criticism is that your team taking shape isnt diverse -- isnt as diverse as it could be, or even was, in terms of getting additional voices, gender, race, ethnic diversity.  So Id like you to address both of those. President Obama:  Sure.  Let me take the second one first.  Im very proud that in the first four years we had as diverse, if not more diverse, a White House and a Cabinet than any in history.  And I intend to continue that, because it turns out that when you look for the very best people, given the incredible diversity of this country, youre going to end up with a diverse staff and a diverse team.  And that very diversity helps to create more effective policymaking and better decision-making for me, because it brings different perspectives to the table.  So if you think about my first four years, the person who probably had the most influence on my foreign policy was a woman. The people who were in charge of moving forward my most important domestic initiative, health care, were women.  The person in charge of our homeland security was a woman.  My two appointments to the Supreme Court were women, and 50 percent of my White House staff were women.  So I think people should expect that that record will be built upon during the next four years. Now, what, Ive made four appointments so far?  And one women -- admittedly, a high-profile one -- is leaving the -- has already left the administration, and I have made a replacement. But I would just suggest that everybody kind of wait until theyve seen all my appointments, whos in the White House staff and whos in my Cabinet before they rush to judgment. Question: [Inaudible] -- the big three. President Obama:  Yes, but I guess what Im saying, Jackie, is that I think until youve seen what my overall team looks like, its premature to assume that somehow were going backwards.  Were not going backwards, were going forward. With respect to this truism about me not socializing enough and patting folks on the back and all that stuff, most people who know me know Im a pretty friendly guy.  And I like a good party. And the truth is that when I was in the Senate, I had great relationships over there, and up until the point that I became President this was not an accusation that you heard very frequently.  I think that really whats gone on in terms of some of the paralysis here in Washington or difficulties in negotiations just have to do with some very stark differences in terms of policy, some very sharp differences in terms of where we stand on issues. And if you think about, let's say, myself and Speaker Boehner, I like Speaker Boehner personally, and when we went out and played golf we had a great time.  But that didn't get a deal done in 2011.  When I'm over here at the congressional picnic and folks are coming up and taking pictures with their family, I promise you, Michelle and I are very nice to them and we have a wonderful time.  But it doesn't prevent them from going onto the floor of the House and blasting me for being a big-spending socialist. And the reason that, in many cases, Congress votes the way they do, or talks the way they talk, or takes positions in negotiations that they take doesn't have to do with me.  It has to do with the imperatives that they feel in terms of their own politics -- right?", "filename": "14January2013FinalFirstTermPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Audience:  Yes! President Obama:  You look fine.  All right, everybody have a seat.  I got some stuff to say.  I've got some stuff to say. Audience Member:  We love you! President Obama:  I love you back.  You know that. So, see, now, whenever people have, like, little signs, you all got to write it bigger, because I'm getting old now.  And I like that picture of me.  That's very nice.  Thank you. Lets get something out of the way up front.  I am not singing today. Audience:  Awww -- President Obama:  Not singing.  Although I will say your board sang to me as I came in for the photograph.  So I know theres some good voices in the auditorium. Let me also say what everybody knows but doesnt always want to say out loud -- you all would rather have Michelle here.  I understand.  I don't blame you.  But I will do my best to fill her shoes.  And she sends everybody her love.  And Malia and Sasha say hi, as well. I want to thank your chair, Roslyn Brock.  I want to thank your president, Cornell Brooks.  I want to thank your Governor, Tom Wolf, whos doing outstanding work and was here.  The Mayor of Philadelphia, Michael Nutter, whos been a great friend and ally.  Governor Dan Malloy of Connecticut, whos here today.  And some outstanding members of Congress who are here.  I want to just say thank you to all of you for your love, for your support, but most importantly, for the work that you are doing in your communities all across the country every single day. It's not always received with a lot of fanfare.  Sometimes it's lonely work; sometimes it's hard work; sometimes it's frustrating work.  But it's necessary work.  And it builds on a tradition of this organization that reshaped the nation. For 106 years, the NAACP has worked to close the gaps between the words of our founding that we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights -- those words try to match those with the realities that we live each and every day. In your first century, this organization stood up to lynching and Jim Crow and segregation; helped to shepherd a Civil Rights Act and a Voting Rights Act.  I would not be here, and so many others would not be here, without the NAACP. In your second century, weve worked together to give more of our children a shot at a quality education; to help more families rise up out of poverty; to protect future generations from environmental damage; to create fair housing; to help more workers find the purpose of a good job.  And together, weve made real progress -- including a My Brothers Keeper initiative to give more young people a fair shot in life; including the passage of a law that declares health care is not a privilege for the few, but a right for all of us. We made progress, but our work is not done.  By just about every measure, the life chances for black and Hispanic youth still lag far behind those of their white peers.  Our kids, Americas children, so often are isolated, without hope, less likely to graduate from high school, less likely to earn a college degree, less likely to be employed, less likely to have health insurance, less likely to own a home. Part of this is a legacy of hundreds of years of slavery and segregation, and structural inequalities that compounded over generations.  It did not happen by accident.  Partly its a result of continuing, if sometimes more subtle, bigotry -- whether in who gets called back for a job interview, or who gets suspended from school, or what neighborhood you are able to rent an apartment in -- which, by the way, is why our recent initiative to strengthen the awareness and effectiveness of fair housing laws is so important.  So we cant be satisfied or not satisfied until the opportunity gap is closed for everybody in America.  Everybody. But today, I want to focus on one aspect of American life that remains particularly skewed by race and by wealth, a source of inequity that has ripple effects on families and on communities and ultimately on our nation -- and that is our criminal justice system. Now, this is not a new topic.  I know sometimes folks discover these things like they just happened.  Theres a long history of inequity in the criminal justice system in America.  When I was in the state legislature in Illinois, we worked to make sure that we had videotaping of interrogations because there were some problems there.  We set up racial profiling laws to prevent the kind of bias in traffic stops that too many people experience.  Since my first campaign, Ive talked about how, in too many cases, our criminal justice system ends up being a pipeline from underfunded, inadequate schools to overcrowded jails. What has changed, though, is that, in recent years the eyes of more Americans have been opened to this truth.  Partly because of cameras, partly because of tragedy, partly because the statistics cannot be ignored, we cant close our eyes anymore.  And the good news -- and this is truly good news -- is that good people of all political persuasions are starting to think we need to do something about this. So lets look at the statistics.  The United States is home to 5 percent of the worlds population, but 25 percent of the worlds prisoners.  Think about that.  Our incarceration rate is four times higher than Chinas.  We keep more people behind bars than the top 35 European countries combined.  And it hasnt always been the case -- this huge explosion in incarceration rates.  In 1980, there were 500,000 people behind bars in America -- half a million people in 1980.  I was in college in 1980.  Many of you were not born in 1980 -- thats okay.  I remember 1980 -- 500,000.  Today there are 2.2 million.  It has quadrupled since 1980.  Our prison population has doubled in the last two decades alone. Now, we need to be honest.  There are a lot of folks who belong in prison.  If were going to deal with this problem and the inequities involved then we also have to speak honestly.  There are some folks who need to be in jail.  They may have had terrible things happen to them in their lives.  We hold out the hope for redemption, but theyve done some bad things. Murderers, predators, rapists, gang leaders, drug kingpins -- we need some of those folks behind bars.  Our communities are safer, thanks to brave police officers and hardworking prosecutors who put those violent criminals in jail. And the studies show that up to a certain point, tougher prosecutors and stiffer sentences for these violent offenders contributed to the decline in violent crime over the last few decades.  Although the science also indicates that you get a point of diminishing returns.  But it is important for us to recognize that violence in our communities is serious and that historically, in fact, the African American community oftentimes was under-policed rather than over-policed.  Folks were very interested in containing the African American community so it couldnt leave segregated areas, but within those areas there wasnt enough police presence. But heres the thing:  Over the last few decades, weve also locked up more and more nonviolent drug offenders than ever before, for longer than ever before.  And that is the real reason our prison population is so high.  In far too many cases, the punishment simply does not fit the crime.  If youre a low-level drug dealer, or you violate your parole, you owe some debt to society.  You have to be held accountable and make amends.  But you dont owe 20 years.  You dont owe a life sentence.  That's disproportionate to the price that should be paid. And by the way, the taxpayers are picking up the tab for that price.  Every year, we spend $80 billion to keep folks incarcerated -- $80 billion.  Now, just to put that in perspective, for $80 billion, we could have universal preschool for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America.  That's what $80 billion buys.  For $80 billion, we could double the salary of every high school teacher in America.   For $80 billion, we could finance new roads and new bridges and new airports, job training programs, research and development.  We're about to get in a big budget debate in Washington -- what I couldnt do with $80 billion.  Its a lot of money.  For what we spend to keep everyone locked up for one year, we could eliminate tuition at every single one of our public colleges and universities. As Republican Senator and presidential candidate Rand Paul has said -- no, and to his credit, hes been consistent on this issue -- imprisoning large numbers of nonviolent drug offenders for long periods of time, costs the taxpayers money, without making them any safer. Roughly one-third of the Justice Departments budget now goes toward incarceration -- one-third.  And there are outstanding public servants at our Justice Department, starting with our outstanding Attorney General, Loretta Lynch -- and weve got some great prosecutors here today -- and they do outstanding work -- so many of them.  But every dollar they have to spend keeping nonviolent drug offenders in prison is a dollar they cant spend going after drug kingpins, or tracking down terrorists, or hiring more police and giving them the resources that would allow them to do a more effective job community policing. And then, of course, there are costs that cant be measured in dollars and cents.  Because the statistics on who gets incarcerated show that by a wide margin, it disproportionately impacts communities of color.  African Americans and Latinos make up 30 percent of our population; they make up 60 percent of our inmates.  About one in every 35 African American men, one in every 88 Latino men is serving time right now.  Among white men, that number is one in 214. The bottom line is that in too many places, black boys and black men, Latino boys and Latino men experience being treated differently under the law. And I want to be clear -- this is not just anecdote.  This is not just barbershop talk.  A growing body of research shows that people of color are more likely to be stopped, frisked, questioned, charged, detained.  African Americans are more likely to be arrested.  They are more likely to be sentenced to more time for the same crime.   And one of the consequences of this is, around one million fathers are behind bars.  Around one in nine African American kids has a parent in prison. What is that doing to our communities?  Whats that doing to those children?  Our nation is being robbed of men and women who could be workers and taxpayers, could be more actively involved in their childrens lives, could be role models, could be community leaders, and right now theyre locked up for a non-violent offense. So our criminal justice system isnt as smart as it should be.  Its not keeping us as safe as it should be.  It is not as fair as it should be.  Mass incarceration makes our country worse off, and we need to do something about it. But heres the good news. Audience Member  All right, good news. President Obama:  Good news.  Dont get me preaching now.  I am feeling more hopeful today because even now, when, lets face it, it seems like Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on anything -- a lot of them agree on this.  In fact, today, back in Washington, Republican senators from Utah and Texas are joining Democratic senators from New Jersey and Rhode Island to talk about how Congress can pass meaningful criminal justice reform this year.   Thats good news.  That is good news.  Good news. That doesnt happen very often.  And its not just senators. This is a cause thats bringing people in both houses of Congress together.  Its created some unlikely bedfellows.  Youve got Van Jones and Newt Gingrich.  Youve got Americans for Tax Reform and the ACLU.  Youve got the NAACP and the Koch brothers.  No, youve got to give them credit.  Youve got to call it like you see it.  There are states from Texas and South Carolina to California and Connecticut who have acted to reduce their prison populations over the last five years and seen their crime rates fall.  Thats good news. My Administration has taken steps on our own to reduce our federal prison population.  So I signed a bill reducing the 100-1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.  Ive commuted the sentences of dozens of people sentenced under old drug laws that we now recognize were unfair, and yesterday I announced that Im commuting dozens more. Under the leadership of Attorney General Eric Holder -- now continued by Loretta Lynch -- federal prosecutors got what he called Smart on Crime, which is refocusing efforts on the worst offenders, pursuing mandatory minimum sentences 20 percent less often than they did the year before.  The idea is you dont always have to charge the max.  To be a good prosecutor, you need to be proportionate.  And it turns out that we're solving just as many cases and there are just as many plea bargains, and its working.  Its just that weve eliminated some of the excess. And recently, something extraordinary happened.  For the first time in 40 years, Americas crime rate and incarceration rate both went down at the same time.  That happened last year. So theres some momentum building for reform.  Theres evidence mounting for why we need reform.  Now I want to spend the rest of my time just laying out some basic principles, some simple ideas for what reform should look like, because we're just at the beginning of this process and we need to make sure that we stay with it.  And Im going to focus on what happens in three places -- in the community, in the courtroom, and in the cell block. So I want to begin with the community because I believe crime is like any other epidemic - the best time to stop it is before it even starts.   And Im going to go ahead and say what Ive said a hundred times before or a thousand times before, and what you've heard me say before, if we make investments early in our children, we will reduce the need to incarcerate those kids. So one study found that for every dollar we invest in pre-K, we save at least twice that down the road in reduced crime.  Getting a teenager a job for the summer costs a fraction of what it costs to lock him up for 15 years.  Investing in our communities makes sense.  It saves taxpayer money if we are consistent about it, and if we recognize that every child deserve opportunity -- not just some, not just our own. What doesnt make sense is treating entire neighborhoods as little more than danger zones where we just surround them.  We ask police to go in there and do the tough job of trying to contain the hopelessness when we are not willing to make the investments to help lift those communities out of hopelessness.  That's not just a police problem; that's a societal problem. Places like West Philly, or West Baltimore, or Ferguson, Missouri -- theyre part of America, too.  They're not separate.   Theyre part of America like anywhere else.  The kids there are American kids, just like your kids and my kids.  So weve got to make sure boys and girls in those communities are loved and cherished and supported and nurtured and invested in.  And we have to have the same standards for those children as we have for our own children. If you are a parent, you know that there are times where boys and girls are going to act out in school.  And the question is, are we letting principals and parents deal with one set of kids and we call the police on another set of kids.  That's not the right thing to do. Weve got to make sure our juvenile justice system remembers that kids are different.  Don't just tag them as future criminals.  Reach out to them as future citizens. And even as we recognize that police officers do one of the toughest, bravest jobs around -- and as we do everything in our power to keep those police officers safe on the job -- Ive talked about this -- we have to restore trust between our police and some of the communities where they serve.  And a good place to start is making sure communities around the country adopt the recommendations from the task force I set up -- that included law enforcement, but also included young people from New York and from Ferguson, and they were able to arrive at a consensus around things like better training, better data collection -- to make sure that policing is more effective and more accountable, but is also more unbiased. So these are steps in the community that will lead to fewer folks being arrested in the first place.  Now, they wont eliminate crime entirely.  Theres going to be crime.  Thats why the second place we need to change is in the courtroom. For nonviolent drug crimes, we need to lower long mandatory minimum sentences -- or get rid of them entirely.  Give judges some discretion around nonviolent crimes so that, potentially, we can steer a young person who has made a mistake in a better direction. We should pass a sentencing reform bill through Congress this year.  We need to ask prosecutors to use their discretion to seek the best punishment, the one that's going to be most effective, instead of just the longest punishment.  We should invest in alternatives to prison, like drug courts and treatment and probation programs -- which ultimately can save taxpayers thousands of dollars per defendant each year. Now, even if were locking up fewer people, even if we are reforming sentencing guidelines, as Ive said before, some criminals still deserve to go to jail.  And as Republican Senator John Cornyn has reminded us, virtually all of the people incarcerated in our prisons will eventually someday be released. And thats why the third place we need to reform is in the cell block. So on Thursday, I will be the first sitting President to visit a federal prison.  And Im going to shine a spotlight on this issue, because while the people in our prisons have made some mistakes -- and sometimes big mistakes -- they are also Americans, and we have to make sure that as they do their time and pay back their debt to society that we are increasing the possibility that they can turn their lives around. That doesnt mean that we will turn everybodys life around. That doesnt mean there arent some hard cases.  But it does mean that we want to be in a position in which if somebody in the midst of imprisonment recognizes the error of their ways, is in the process of reflecting about where theyve been and where they should be going, weve got to make sure that theyre in a position to make the turn. And thats why we should not tolerate conditions in prison that have no place in any civilized country.  We should not be tolerating overcrowding in prison.  We should not be tolerating gang activity in prison.  We should not be tolerating rape in prison.  And we shouldnt be making jokes about it in our popular culture.  Thats no joke.  These things are unacceptable. Whats more, Ive asked my Attorney General to start a review of the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons.  The social science shows that an environment like that is often more likely to make inmates more alienated, more hostile, potentially more violent.  Do we really think it makes sense to lock so many people alone in tiny cells for 23 hours a day, sometimes for months or even years at a time? That is not going to make us safer.  Thats not going to make us stronger.  And if those individuals are ultimately released, how are they ever going to adapt?  Its not smart. Our prisons should be a place where we can train people for skills that can help them find a job, not train them to become more hardened criminals. Look, I dont want to pretend like this is all easy.  But some places are doing better than others.  Montgomery County, Maryland put a job training center inside the prison walls -- to give folks a head start in thinking about what might you do otherwise than committing crime.  Thats a good idea. Heres another good idea -- one with bipartisan support in Congress: Lets reward prisoners with reduced sentences if they complete programs that make them less likely to commit a repeat offense.  Let's invest in innovative new approaches to link former prisoners with employers and help them stay on track.  Lets follow the growing number of our states and cities and private companies who have decided to Ban the Box on job applications -- so that former prisoners who have done their time and are now trying to get straight with society have a decent shot in a job interview.  And if folks have served their time, and theyve reentered society, they should be able to vote. Communities that give our young people every shot at success; courts that are tough but fair; prisons that recognize eventually the majority will be released and so seek to prepare these returning citizens to grab that second chance -- thats where we need to build. But I want to add this.  We cant ask our police, or our prosecutors, or our prison guards, or our judges to bear the entire burden of containing and controlling problems that the rest of us are not facing up to and willing to do something about. So, yes, we have to stand up to those who are determined to slash investments in our communities at any cost -- cutting preschool programs, cutting job-training programs, cutting affordable housing programs, cutting community policing programs. Thats shortsighted.  Those investments make this country strong.   Weve got to invest in opportunity more than ever. An African American man born roughly 25 years ago has just a one-in-two chance of being employed today.  More than one in three African American children are growing up in poverty.  When Americas unemployment rate was 9.5 percent, when I first came into office, as it was going up, we properly recognized this is a crisis.  Right now, the unemployment rate among African Americans is 9.5 percent.  What should we call that?", "filename": "14July2015NAACPConventionAddress.txt"}, {"question": "I was just told backstage, when she was asked to introduce me, there were some folks who were organizing this amazing event that said, is she going to feel a little nervous speaking in front of 5,000 people?  And so they asked her and she said, oh, no, I just spoke to 11,000 last week.  So we were looking backstage -- she was on her tippy-toes with her entrepreneurial self. So I know youre really here to see Michelle.  Or Oprah.  Actually, theyre together, so youre here to see both of them.  I cannot compete with them.  But I did want to stop by and make one thing very clear -- I may be a little grayer than I was eight years ago, but this is what a feminist looks like.  Of course, in my household theres no choice. It is great to be with so many friends.  One of my first acts as President was to establish the White House Council on Women and Girls, led by Tina Tchen and Valerie Jarrett, and theyve worked with a lot of you very closely.  Were so appreciative of those of you who helped not just make this event possible, but have guided a lot of our thinking across our Administration. Weve got some outstanding members of Congress -- of course including my dear friend and one of the finest Speakers weve ever had, and hope to soon have again, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi.  And I want to thank all of you who worked so hard to make this event happen.  Because this is an opportunity to reflect on how far weve come, and why it is weve got to keep going. It was almost 100 years ago that Alice Paul and her fellow suffragists were arrested for picketing outside the White House for the right to vote.  Today, women make up more than half of the electorate.  For the first time in history, a woman is a major partys presumptive presidential nominee.   And we are here, at the first-ever White House Summit on the United State of Women. Because of all of you, over the past seven years, we have significantly improved the lives of women and girls not just here at home, but around the world.  And I could not be prouder of what weve accomplished.  I want to talk about why it matters, and why weve got to do more. Some of you may know that on Friday, my older daughter Malia graduated from high school.  And I sat in the back and wore dark glasses.  And only cried once, but it was -- I made this weird sound because I was choking back -- and people looked at me, people sitting in front of us turned back.  And then I suppressed it.  But I was thinking about how she is graduating at this extraordinary time for women in America. The year I was born, in 1961, women made up less than 40 percent of college students.  Today, you earn almost 60 percent of college degrees, make up roughly half of the workforce.  Back then, the pill was still illegal in some states.  And today, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, birth control is free.  In the old days, women actually needed a husband to open a credit card.  Today, more women are choosing to be single -- and all Americans are able to marry whoever they love. Fifty-four years ago, Katherine Johnson did the behind-the-scenes math to put a man in orbit.  Today, almost 60 women have blasted into space themselves.  When I was growing up, fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports.  Today, because of Title IX, more than 3 million girls are on the field.  Women are leading America at every level of society, from Hollywood to Silicon Valley, from the c-suite to the federal bench to the Federal Reserve. And that is progress.  Its real and we have to celebrate it, but we also have to remember that progress is not inevitable.  Its the result of decades of slow, tireless, often frustrating and unheralded work by people like Dorothy Pitman-Hughes and Gloria Steinem, who is here today -- people who opened our eyes to the discrimination, both subtle and overt, that women face.  People like Pauli Murray and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who insisted on equal justice under the law.  People like Wilma Mankiller and Patsy Mink, who redefined what leadership looks like.  And, yes, people like Hillary Clinton whove raised the expectations of our daughters -- and our sons -- for what is possible. In other words, our progress has been the result of countless ordinary women and men whose names will never be written into the history books or chiseled on monuments, but who dedicated their lives to ensuring that America lives up to its promise of liberty and justice for all. Whats also true is, is that despite all that incredible progress, we are living in a time of great change, a time where people are economically anxious.  Unemployment has dropped below five percent.  Wages are growing again.  But while weve made progress in narrowing the gap between rich and poor, it is still too big and the trend lines, because of globalization and automation, are still upon us. You hear politicians peddle the fiction that blocking immigrants or cutting off trade or big government are all to blame, but we know what the causes are.  The rise of global competition, the weakening of the labor movement and participation in unions, the automation of more jobs, the race of technology -- all these trends have the potential of leaving workers behind.  They let a few at the top do even better.  And we see some of those divisions not just between groups, but within groups.  There are women who have never had more opportunity, but there are a lot of women who are still stuck in the toughest of economic circumstances. There is an important reason that so many working families feel like the system is rigged, and its because the economy hasnt caught up to some of the enormous changes that have transformed America over the past 50 years.  Those days when the average family was a dad who went to work every day and a mom who stayed at home and did all the unpaid labor -- thats not what our economy looks like anymore.  Household and work arrangements come in all shapes and all combinations, and yet, our workplace policies still look like theyre straight out of Mad Men. I will tell you, a lot of the problems that cross my desk are really hard to solve.  If they end up on my desk, its because other people couldnt solve them.  But this issue of how we support working families, the policies that we could put in place that would make a meaningful difference, here we actually have solutions right in front of us.  Just as we know what the problems are, we know what some of the solutions are. We need equal pay for equal work.  We need paid family and sick leave.  We need affordable child care.  Weve got to raise the minimum wage.  If were truly a nation of family values, we wouldnt put up with the fact that many women cant even get a paid day off to give birth.  We should guarantee paid maternity leave and paid paternity leave, too.  Thats how you value families.  Thats how employers retain great workers.  And its good for women -- because when childcare falls disproportionately on mothers, as it often does, it makes it that much harder to advance in their careers. So weve got to retool our system so that modern families and modern businesses can thrive.  And let me be clear, this is not about big government, or expanding some fictional welfare-and-food-stamp state, the 47 percent mooching off the government.  It is accounting for the realities of how people live now, today -- the necessities of a 21st century economy. Weve gotten some things done through executive actions.  When we had a cooperative Congress, we got a whole lot more done.  So far, a lot of Republicans in Congress have been unwilling to act on these agenda items that I just mentioned.  But we just keep on looking for ways to get stuff done.  They keep on waiting for this whole lame duck thing to happen.  Let me tell you, it will happen as soon as Ive elected a really good successor to carry on our policies.  But until then, were working pretty hard. But weve made progress.  The first bill I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.  And I know some of you have seen Lilly here today.  We passed the Affordable Care Act to give more Americans the security of health care coverage so that not only people without health insurance could finally get it, but people who had health insurance were treated fairly, so that, for example, no insurer could charge you more just for being a woman.  Dry cleaners are next.  Valerie, we need to work on that, dont we?  Those little blouses of yours -- I dont know why they charge so much. So my Administration has taken what action that we can.  And weve strengthened equal pay protections and paid sick leave for federal contractors, enhanced work flexibility for all federal employees, raised the minimum wage for federal contract workers, extended overtime-pay protections to over four million workers across the country.  We try to set a good example providing my staff with 12 weeks of paid parental leave.  And by the way, weve been having a lot of babies -- Ive noticed -- in the White House.  Which Im happy about -- I love babies.  They bring them into the Oval Office and they make me feel good. This is the right thing to do, its the smart thing to do.  And the great news is, were not the only ones doing it.  Youve got cities and states and businesses across the country that are adjusting to meet the needs of todays workers.  In fact, today we can announce that 28 of Americas leading businesses are committed to closing the gender pay gap.  We should encourage more businesses to join them.  We should shop and frequent those companies that are doing the right thing because the truth is, most folks agree with each other on this.  We dont have to have Congress agree with us -- we can go ahead and make progress without waiting for them.  Theyll catch up eventually.  Theyre usually a lagging indicator on these issues. If we really want workplace policies that work for everybody, I will say, though, it would help if we had more women in Congress.  It would help if we had more women in the corner suite.  I have a corner suite, by the way.  Just making that connection for you. If we are going to truly change our policies and our politics, then were also going to have to change something else, though.  Were going to have to be honest with ourselves.  Were going to have to change something else.  Were going to have to change the way we see ourselves.  And this is happening already, but I want us to be more intentional about it.  I know Im preaching to the choir here, but were still boxed in by stereotypes about how men and women should behave. As the great Shirley Chisholm once said, The emotional, sexual, and psychological stereotyping of females begin when the doctor says, Its a girl.  And that has consequences for all of us, whether were men or women, black, white, gay, straight, transgender or otherwise. We need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure, and our boys to be assertive; that criticizes our daughters for speaking out, and our sons for shedding a tear. We need to change the attitude that punishes women for their sexuality but gives men a pat on the back for theirs.  We need to change an Internet where women are routinely harassed and threatened when they go online. We need to keep changing the attitude that congratulates men for changing a diaper, stigmatizes full-time dads, penalizes working moms. We need to keep changing the attitude that prioritizes being confident, competitive, and ambitious in the workplace -- unless youre a woman. We need to keep changing a culture that shines a particularly unforgiving light on women and girls of color.  About how they look, about how they feel, about what they should or should not do.  Michelle will talk about this in a little bit.  Shes talked about this.  Despite her extraordinary achievements and success, the fact that she is -- she is an American original, she is unique, but she still had times where shes had doubts, where shes had to worry whether she was acting the right way or looking the right way, or whether she was being too assertive or too angry.  You remember that?", "filename": "14June2016UnitedStateofWomenWhiteHouseSummitAddress.txt"}, {"question": "I have to say, though, whenever I come to these things, I start thinking about Malia and Sasha graduating, and I start tearing up and -- it's terrible.  I don't know how you guys are holding it together. I will begin by telling a hard truth:  Im a Columbia college graduate.  I know there can be a little bit of a sibling rivalry here.  But Im honored nevertheless to be your commencement speaker today -- although Ive got to say, you set a pretty high bar given the past three years. Hillary Clinton -- Meryl Streep -- Sheryl Sandberg -- these are not easy acts to follow. But I will point out Hillary is doing an extraordinary job as one of the finest Secretaries of State America has ever had.  We gave Meryl the Presidential Medal of Arts and Humanities.  Sheryl is not just a good friend; shes also one of our economic advisers.  So its like the old saying goes -- keep your friends close, and your Barnard commencement speakers even closer. There's wisdom in that. Now, the year I graduated -- this area looks familiar -- the year I graduated was 1983, the first year women were admitted to Columbia.  Sally Ride was the first American woman in space.  Music was all about Michael and the Moonwalk. AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Do it! THE PRESIDENT:  No Moonwalking.  No Moonwalking today. We had the Walkman, not iPods.  Some of the streets around here were not quite so inviting.  Times Square was not a family destination. So I know this is all ancient history.  Nothing worse than commencement speakers droning on about bygone days.  But for all the differences, the Class of 1983 actually had a lot in common with all of you.  For we, too, were heading out into a world at a moment when our country was still recovering from a particularly severe economic recession.  It was a time of change.  It was a time of uncertainty.  It was a time of passionate political debates.  You can relate to this because just as you were starting out finding your way around this campus, an economic crisis struck that would claim more than 5 million jobs before the end of your freshman year.  Since then, some of you have probably seen parents put off retirement, friends struggle to find work.  And you may be looking toward the future with that same sense of concern that my generation did when we were sitting where you are now.  Of course, as young women, youre also going to grapple with some unique challenges, like whether youll be able to earn equal pay for equal work; whether youll be able to balance the demands of your job and your family; whether youll be able to fully control decisions about your own health.  And while opportunities for women have grown exponentially over the last 30 years, as young people, in many ways you have it even tougher than we did.  This recession has been more brutal, the job losses steeper.  Politics seems nastier.  Congress more gridlocked than ever.  Some folks in the financial world have not exactly been model corporate citizens. No wonder that faith in our institutions has never been lower, particularly when good news doesnt get the same kind of ratings as bad news anymore.  Every day you receive a steady stream of sensationalism and scandal and stories with a message that suggest change isnt possible; that you cant make a difference; that you wont be able to close that gap between life as it is and life as you want it to be. My job today is to tell you dont believe it.  Because as tough as things have been, I am convinced you are tougher.  Ive seen your passion and Ive seen your service.  Ive seen you engage and Ive seen you turn out in record numbers.  Ive heard your voices amplified by creativity and a digital fluency that those of us in older generations can barely comprehend.  Ive seen a generation eager, impatient even, to step into the rushing waters of history and change its course. And that defiant, can-do spirit is what runs through the veins of American history.  Its the lifeblood of all our progress.  And it is that spirit which we need your generation to embrace and rekindle right now. See, the question is not whether things will get better -- they always do.  The question is not whether weve got the solutions to our challenges -- weve had them within our grasp for quite some time.  We know, for example, that this country would be better off if more Americans were able to get the kind of education that youve received here at Barnard -- if more people could get the specific skills and training that employers are looking for today.  We know that wed all be better off if we invest in science and technology that sparks new businesses and medical breakthroughs; if we developed more clean energy so we could use less foreign oil and reduce the carbon pollution thats threatening our planet. We know that were better off when there are rules that stop big banks from making bad bets with other peoples money and -- when insurance companies arent allowed to drop your coverage when you need it most or charge women differently from men.  Indeed, we know we are better off when women are treated fairly and equally in every aspect of American life -- whether its the salary you earn or the health decisions you make. We know these things to be true.  We know that our challenges are eminently solvable.  The question is whether together, we can muster the will -- in our own lives, in our common institutions, in our politics -- to bring about the changes we need.  And Im convinced your generation possesses that will.  And I believe that the women of this generation -- that all of you will help lead the way. Now, I recognize thats a cheap applause line when you're giving a commencement at Barnard. Its the easy thing to say.  But its true.  It is -- in part, it is simple math.  Today, women are not just half this country; youre half its workforce.  More and more women are out-earning their husbands.  Youre more than half of our college graduates, and masters graduates, and PhDs.  So youve got us outnumbered. After decades of slow, steady, extraordinary progress, you are now poised to make this the century where women shape not only their own destiny but the destiny of this nation and of this world. But how far your leadership takes this country, how far it takes this world -- well, that will be up to you.  Youve got to want it.  It will not be handed to you.  And as someone who wants that future -- that better future -- for you, and for Malia and Sasha, as somebody whos had the good fortune of being the husband and the father and the son of some strong, remarkable women, allow me to offer just a few pieces of advice.  That's obligatory.  Bear with me. My first piece of advice is this:  Dont just get involved.  Fight for your seat at the table.  Better yet, fight for a seat at the head of the table. Its been said that the most important role in our democracy is the role of citizen.  And indeed, it was 225 years ago today that the Constitutional Convention opened in Philadelphia, and our founders, citizens all, began crafting an extraordinary document.  Yes, it had its flaws -- flaws that this nation has strived to protect (perfect) over time.  Questions of race and gender were unresolved.  No womans signature graced the original document -- although we can assume that there were founding mothers whispering smarter things in the ears of the founding fathers.  I mean, that's almost certain. What made this document special was that it provided the space -- the possibility -- for those who had been left out of our charter to fight their way in.  It provided people the language to appeal to principles and ideals that broadened democracys reach.  It allowed for protest, and movements, and the dissemination of new ideas that would repeatedly, decade after decade, change the world -- a constant forward movement that continues to this day. Our founders understood that America does not stand still; we are dynamic, not static.  We look forward, not back.  And now that new doors have been opened for you, youve got an obligation to seize those opportunities.  You need to do this not just for yourself but for those who dont yet enjoy the choices that youve had, the choices you will have.  And one reason many workplaces still have outdated policies is because women only account for 3 percent of the CEOs at Fortune 500 companies.  One reason were actually refighting long-settled battles over womens rights is because women occupy fewer than one in five seats in Congress. Now, Im not saying that the only way to achieve success is by climbing to the top of the corporate ladder or running for office -- although, lets face it, Congress would get a lot more done if you did.  That I think were sure about.  But if you decide not to sit yourself at the table, at the very least youve got to make sure you have a say in who does.  It matters. Before women like Barbara Mikulski and Olympia Snowe and others got to Congress, just to take one example, much of federally-funded research on diseases focused solely on their effects on men.  It wasnt until women like Patsy Mink and Edith Green got to Congress and passed Title IX, 40 years ago this year, that we declared women, too, should be allowed to compete and win on Americas playing fields.  Until a woman named Lilly Ledbetter showed up at her office and had the courage to step up and say, you know what, this isnt right, women werent being treated fairly -- we lacked some of the tools we needed to uphold the basic principle of equal pay for equal work. So dont accept somebody elses construction of the way things ought to be.  Its up to you to right wrongs.  Its up to you to point out injustice.  Its up to you to hold the system accountable and sometimes upend it entirely.  Its up to you to stand up and to be heard, to write and to lobby, to march, to organize, to vote.  Dont be content to just sit back and watch.  Those who oppose change, those who benefit from an unjust status quo, have always bet on the publics cynicism or the public's complacency.  Throughout American history, though, they have lost that bet, and I believe they will this time as well.  But ultimately, Class of 2012, that will depend on you.  Dont wait for the person next to you to be the first to speak up for whats right.  Because maybe, just maybe, theyre waiting on you.  Which brings me to my second piece of advice:  Never underestimate the power of your example.  The very fact that you are graduating, let alone that more women now graduate from college than men, is only possible because earlier generations of women -- your mothers, your grandmothers, your aunts -- shattered the myth that you couldnt or shouldnt be where you are. I think of a friend of mine whos the daughter of immigrants.  When she was in high school, her guidance counselor told her, you know what, youre just not college material.  You should think about becoming a secretary.  Well, she was stubborn, so she went to college anyway.  She got her masters.  She ran for local office, won.  She ran for state office, she won.  She ran for Congress, she won.  And lo and behold, Hilda Solis did end up becoming a secretary -- she is Americas Secretary of Labor. So think about what that means to a young Latina girl when she sees a Cabinet secretary that looks like her.  Think about what it means to a young girl in Iowa when she sees a presidential candidate who looks like her.  Think about what it means to a young girl walking in Harlem right down the street when she sees a U.N. ambassador who looks like her.  Do not underestimate the power of your example.  This diploma opens up new possibilities, so reach back, convince a young girl to earn one, too.  If you earned your degree in areas where we need more women -- like computer science or engineering -- reach back and persuade another student to study it, too.  If you're going into fields where we need more women, like construction or computer engineering -- reach back, hire someone new.  Be a mentor.  Be a role model. Until a girl can imagine herself, can picture herself as a computer programmer, or a combatant commander, she wont become one.  Until there are women who tell her, ignore our pop culture obsession over beauty and fashion -- and focus instead on studying and inventing and competing and leading, shell think those are the only things that girls are supposed to care about.  Now, Michelle will say, nothing wrong with caring about it a little bit. You can be stylish and powerful, too.  That's Michelles advice. And never forget that the most important example a young girl will ever follow is that of a parent.  Malia and Sasha are going to be outstanding women because Michelle and Marian Robinson are outstanding women.  So understand your power, and use it wisely.   My last piece of advice -- this is simple, but perhaps most important:  Persevere.  Persevere.  Nothing worthwhile is easy.  No one of achievement has avoided failure -- sometimes catastrophic failures.  But they keep at it.  They learn from mistakes.  They dont quit. You know, when I first arrived on this campus, it was with little money, fewer options.  But it was here that I tried to find my place in this world.  I knew I wanted to make a difference, but it was vague how in fact Id go about it.  But I wanted to do my part to do my part to shape a better world. So even as I worked after graduation in a few unfulfilling jobs here in New York -- I will not list them all -- even as I went from motley apartment to motley apartment, I reached out.  I started to write letters to community organizations all across the country.  And one day, a small group of churches on the South Side of Chicago answered, offering me work with people in neighborhoods hit hard by steel mills that were shutting down and communities where jobs were dying away. The community had been plagued by gang violence, so once I arrived, one of the first things we tried to do was to mobilize a meeting with community leaders to deal with gangs.  And Id worked for weeks on this project.  We invited the police; we made phone calls; we went to churches; we passed out flyers.  The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of this crowd.  And we waited, and we waited.  And finally, a group of older folks walked in to the hall and they sat down.  And this little old lady raised her hand and asked, Is this where the bingo game is?  It was a disaster.  Nobody showed up.  My first big community meeting -- nobody showed up. And later, the volunteers I worked with told me, that's it; were quitting.  They'd been doing this for two years even before I had arrived.  They had nothing to show for it.  And Ill be honest, I felt pretty discouraged as well.  I didn't know what I was doing.  I thought about quitting.  And as we were talking, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street.  And they were just throwing rocks up at a boarded building.  They had nothing better to do  -- late at night, just throwing rocks.  And I said to the volunteers, Before you quit, answer one question.  What will happen to those boys if you quit?  Who will fight for them if we dont?  Who will give them a fair shot if we leave? And one by one, the volunteers decided not to quit.  We went back to those neighborhoods and we kept at it.  We registered new voters, and we set up after-school programs, and we fought for new jobs, and helped people live lives with some measure of dignity.  And we sustained ourselves with those small victories.  We didnt set the world on fire.  Some of those communities are still very poor.  There are still a lot of gangs out there.  But I believe that it was those small victories that helped me win the bigger victories of my last three and a half years as President. And I wish I could say that this perseverance came from some innate toughness in me.  But the truth is, it was learned.  I got it from watching the people who raised me.  More specifically, I got it from watching the women who shaped my life.  I grew up as the son of a single mom who struggled to put herself through school and make ends meet.  She had marriages that fell apart; even went on food stamps at one point to help us get by.  But she didnt quit.  And she earned her degree, and made sure that through scholarships and hard work, my sister and I earned ours.  She used to wake me up when we were living overseas -- wake me up before dawn to study my English lessons.  And when Id complain, shed just look at me and say, This is no picnic for me either, buster. And my mom ended up dedicating herself to helping women around the world access the money they needed to start their own businesses -- she was an early pioneer in microfinance.  And that meant, though, that she was gone a lot, and she had her own struggles trying to figure out balancing motherhood and a career.  And when she was gone, my grandmother stepped up to take care of me.  She only had a high school education.  She got a job at a local bank.  She hit the glass ceiling, and watched men she once trained promoted up the ladder ahead of her.  But she didnt quit.  Rather than grow hard or angry each time she got passed over, she kept doing her job as best as she knew how, and ultimately ended up being vice president at the bank.  She didnt quit. And later on, I met a woman who was assigned to advise me on my first summer job at a law firm.  And she gave me such good advice that I married her.  And Michelle and I gave everything we had to balance our careers and a young family.  But lets face it, no matter how enlightened I must have thought myself to be, it often fell more on her shoulders when I was traveling, when I was away.  I know that when she was with our girls, shed feel guilty that she wasnt giving enough time to her work, and when she was at her work, shed feel guilty she wasnt giving enough time to our girls.  And both of us wished we had some superpower that would let us be in two places at once.  But we persisted.  We made that marriage work.  And the reason Michelle had the strength to juggle everything, and put up with me and eventually the public spotlight, was because she, too, came from a family of folks who didnt quit -- because she saw her dad get up and go to work every day even though he never finished college, even though he had crippling MS.  She saw her mother, even though she never finished college, in that school, that urban school, every day making sure Michelle and her brother were getting the education they deserved.  Michelle saw how her parents never quit.  They never indulged in self-pity, no matter how stacked the odds were against them.  They didn't quit. Those are the folks who inspire me.  People ask me sometimes, who inspires you, Mr. President?", "filename": "14May2012BarnardCollegeCommencementSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "First of all, I want to reiterate what I said on Friday.  Right now, our economy is still recovering from a very deep and damaging crisis, so our top priority has to be jobs and growth.  Weve got to build on the progress that weve made, because this nation succeeds when weve got a growing, thriving middle class.  And thats the idea at the core of the plan that I talked about on the campaign trail over the last year:  Rewarding manufacturers and small businesses that create jobs here, not overseas; providing more Americans the chance to earn the skills that businesses are looking for right now; keeping this country at the forefront of research, technology, and clean energy; putting people back to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, and our schools; and reducing our deficit in a balanced and responsible way. Now, on this last item, we face a very clear deadline that requires us to make some big decisions on jobs, taxes and deficits by the end of the year.  Both parties voted to set this deadline.  And I believe that both parties can work together to make these decisions in a balanced and responsible way.   Yesterday, I had a chance to meet with labor and civic leaders for their input.  Today, Im meeting with CEOs of some of Americas largest companies.  And Ill meet with leaders of both parties of Congress before the week is out.  Because theres only one way to solve these challenges, and that is to do it together. As Ive said before, Im open to compromise and Im open to new ideas.  And Ive been encouraged over the past week to hear Republican after Republican agree on the need for more revenue from the wealthiest Americans as part of our arithmetic if were going to be serious about reducing the deficit.    Because when it comes to taxes, there are two pathways available:  Option one, if Congress fails to act by the end of the year, everybodys taxes will automatically go up -- including the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $250,000 a year and the 97 percent of small businesses who earn less than $250,000 a year.  That doesnt make sense.  Our economy cant afford that right now.  Certainly no middle-class family can afford that right now.  And nobody in either party says that they want it to happen. The other option is to pass a law right now that would prevent any tax hike whatsoever on the first $250,000 of everybodys income.  And by the way, that means every American, including the wealthiest Americans, get a tax cut.  It means that 98 percent of all Americans, and 97 percent of all small businesses wont see their taxes go up a single dime.  The Senate has already passed a law like this.  Democrats in the House are ready to pass a law like this.  And I hope Republicans in the House come on board, too.  We should not hold the middle class hostage while we debate tax cuts for the wealthy.  We should at least do what we agree on, and that's to keep middle-class taxes low.  And Ill bring everyone in to sign it right away so we can give folks some certainty before the holiday season. I wont pretend that figuring out everything else will be easy, but I'm confident we can do it -- and I know we have to.  I know that that's what the American people want us to do.  That was the very clear message from the election last week.  And that was the message of a letter that I received over the weekend.  It came from a man in Tennessee who began by writing that he didnt vote for me -- which is okay.  But what he said was even though he didnt give me his vote, hes giving me his support to move this country forward.  And he said the same to his Republican representatives in Washington.  He said that hell back each of us, regardless of party, as long as we work together to make life better for all of us.  And he made it clear that if we dont make enough progress, hell be back in touch.  My hope, he wrote, is that we can make progress in light of personal and party principles, special interest groups, and years of business as usual.  Weve got to work together and put our differences aside. I couldn't say it better myself.  Thats precisely what I intend to do. And with that, let me open it up for your questions.  And I'm going to start off with Ben Feller of AP. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Can you assure the American people that there have been no breaches of national security or classified information in the scandal involving Generals Petraeus and Allen?  And do you think that you as Commander-in-Chief and the American people should have been told that the CIA chief was under investigation before the election? President Obama:  Well, I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security.  Obviously theres an ongoing investigation.  I don't want to comment on the specifics of the investigation.  The FBI has its own protocols in terms of how they proceed, and I'm going to let Director Mueller and others examine those protocols and make some statements to the public generally. I do want to emphasize what Ive said before:  General Petraeus had an extraordinary career.  He served this country with great distinction in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and as head of the CIA.  By his own assessment, he did not meet the standards that he felt were necessary as the Director of CIA with respect to this personal matter that he is now dealing with, with his family and with his wife.  And its on that basis that he tendered his resignation, and its on that basis that I accepted it. But I want to emphasize that from my perspective at least, he has provided this country an extraordinary service.  We are safer because of the work that Dave Petraeus has done.  And my main hope right now is, is that he and his family are able to move on and that this ends up being a single side note on what has otherwise been an extraordinary career. Question:  What about voters?  Did they deserve to know? President Obama:  Again, I think youre going to have to talk to the FBI in terms of what their general protocols are when it comes to what started off as a potential criminal investigation. One of the challenges here is, is that were not supposed to meddle in criminal investigations, and thats been our practice. And I think that there are certain procedures that both the FBI follow, or DOJ follow, when theyre involved in these investigations.  Thats traditionally been how we view things, in part because people are innocent until proven guilty, and we want to make sure that we dont pre-judge these kinds of situations.  And so my expectation is, is that they followed protocols that they already established. Jessica Yellin.  Wheres Jessica? Question:  Mr. President, on the fiscal cliff, two years ago, sir, you said that you wouldnt extend the Bush-era tax cuts, but at the end of the day, you did.  So, respectfully, sir, why should the American people and the Republicans believe that you wont cave again this time? President Obama:  Well, two years ago, the economy was in a different situation.  We were still very much in the early parts of recovering from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  And ultimately, we came together not only to extend the Bush tax cuts, but also a wide range of policies that were going to be good for the economy at that point -- unemployment insurance extensions, payroll tax extension -- all of which made a difference, and is part of the reason why what we've seen now is 32 consecutive months of job growth and over 5.5 million jobs created and the unemployment rate coming down. But what I said at the time is what I meant, which is this was a one-time proposition.  And what I have told leaders privately as well as publicly is that we cannot afford to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.  What we can do is make sure that middle-class taxes dont go up.  And so the most important step we can take right now -- I think the foundation for a deal that helps the economy, creates jobs, gives consumers certainty, which means gives businesses confidence that they're going to have consumers during the holiday season -- is if we right away say 98 percent of Americans are not going to see their taxes go up; 97 percent of small businesses are not going to see their taxes go up.  If we get that in place, we are actually removing half of the fiscal cliff.  Half of the danger to our economy is removed by that single step.  And what we can then do is shape a process whereby we look at tax reform -- which I'm very eager to do.  I think we can simplify our tax system.  I think we can make it more efficient. We can eliminate loopholes and deductions that have a distorting effect on our economy.  I believe that we have to continue to take a serious look at how we reform our entitlements, because health care costs continue to be the biggest driver of our deficits. So there is a package to be shaped, and I'm confident that parties -- folks of goodwill in both parties can make that happen.  But what I'm not going to do is to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent that we can't afford, and according to economists, will have the least positive impact on our economy. Question:  You've said that the wealthiest must pay more.  Would closing loopholes instead of raising rates for them satisfy you? President Obama:  I think that there are loopholes that can be closed, and we should look at how we can make the process of deductions, the filing process easier, simpler.  But when it comes to the top 2 percent, what Im not going to do is to extend further a tax cut for folks who dont need it, which would cost close to a trillion dollars.  And its very difficult to see how you make up that trillion dollars -- if were serious about deficit reduction -- just by closing loopholes and deductions.  The math tends not to work.  And I think its important to establish a basic principle that was debated extensively during the course of this campaign.  I mean, this shouldnt be a surprise to anybody.  If there was one thing that everybody understood was a big difference between myself and Mr. Romney, it was when it comes to how we reduce our deficit, I argued for a balanced, responsible approach, and part of that included making sure that the wealthiest Americans pay a little bit more.  I think every voter out there understood that that was an important debate, and the majority of voters agreed with me.  By the way, more voters agreed with me on this issue than voted for me.  So weve got a clear majority of the American people who recognize if were going to be serious about deficit reduction, weve got to do it in a balanced way.  The only question now is are we going to hold the middle class hostage in order to go ahead and let that happen?  Or can we all step back and say, heres something we agree on -- we dont want middle-class taxes to go up.  Lets go ahead and lock that in.  That will be good for the economy.  It will be good for consumers.  It will be good for businesses.  It takes the edge off the fiscal cliff.  And lets also then commit ourselves to the broader package of deficit reduction that includes entitlement changes and it includes potentially tax reform, as well as Im willing to look at additional work that we can do on the discretionary spending side. So I want a big deal.  I want a comprehensive deal.  I want to see if we can, at least for the foreseeable future, provide certainty to businesses and the American people so that we can focus on job growth, so that were also investing in the things that we need.  But right now what I want to make sure of is that taxes on middle-class families dont go up.  And theres a very easy way to do that.  We could get that done by next week. Lori Montenegro, Telemundo. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  On immigration reform, the criticism in the past has been that you did not put forth legislation with specific ideas and send it up to the Hill.  This time around you have said again that this will be one of the top priorities for a second term.  Will you then send legislation to the Hill?  And exactly what do you envision is broad immigration reform?  Does that include a legalization program?  And also, what lessons, if any, did Democrats learn from this last election and the Latino vote? President Obama:  Well, I think what was incredibly encouraging was to see a significant increase in Latino turnout. It is the fastest-growing group in the country.  And historically what youve seen is the Latino vote, vote at lower rates than the broader population, and that's beginning to change.  You're starting to see a sense of empowerment and civic participation that I think is going to be powerful and good for the country. And it is why Im very confident that we can get immigration reform done.  Before the election I had given a couple interviews where I predicted that the Latino vote was going to be strong, and that that would cause some reflection on the part of Republicans about their position on immigration reform.  I think were starting to see that already.  I think that's a positive sign. This has not historically been a partisan issue -- weve had President Bush and John McCain and others who have supported comprehensive immigration reform in the past.  So we need to seize the moment.  And my expectation is, is that we get a bill introduced and we begin the process in Congress very soon after my inauguration.  And in fact, some conversations I think are already beginning to take place among senators and congressmen and my staff about what would this look like. And when I say comprehensive immigration reform, it is very similar to the outlines of previous efforts at comprehensive immigration reform.  I think it should include a continuation of the strong border security measures that weve taken because we have to secure our borders.  I think it should contain serious penalties for companies that are purposely hiring undocumented workers and taking advantage of them.  And I do think that there should be a pathway for legal status for those who are living in this country, are not engaged in criminal activity, are here simply to work.  Its important for them to pay back-taxes.  Its important for them to learn English.  Its important for them to potentially pay a fine.  But to give them the avenue whereby they can resolve their legal status here in this country I think is very important. Obviously, making sure that we put into law what the first step that weve taken administratively dealing with the DREAM Act kids is very important as well.  One thing that Im very clear about is that young people who are brought here through no fault of their own, who have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to our flag, want to serve in our military, want to go to school and contribute to our society, that they shouldnt be under the cloud of deportation, that we should give them every opportunity to earn their citizenship. And so there are other components to it, obviously.  The business community continues to be concerned about getting enough high-skill workers, and I am a believer that if youve got a PhD in physics or computer science who wants to stay here and start a business here, we shouldnt make it harder for him to stay here; we should try to encourage him to contribute to this society.  I think that the agricultural sector obviously has very specific concerns about making sure that theyve got a workforce that helps deliver food to our tables.  So there are going to be a bunch of components to it, but I think whatever process we have needs to make sure our border security is strong, needs to deal with employers effectively, needs to provide a pathway for the undocumented here, needs to deal with the DREAM Act kids.  And I think thats something that we can get done. Chuck Todd.  Wheres Chuck? Question:  Mr. President, I just want to follow on both Bens question and Jessicas question.  On having to do with Bens question -- President Obama:  How about Loris question?  Do you want to follow up on that one, too? Question:  No, I feel like you answered that one completely.  Are you withholding judgment on whether you should have known sooner that there was a potential -- that there was an investigation into whether your CIA Director -- potentially there was a national security breach with your CIA Director -- do you believe you should have known sooner?  Are you withholding judgment until the investigation is complete on that front?  And then the follow-up to Jessicas question -- tax rates.  Are you -- is there no deal at the end of the year if tax rates for the top 2 percent arent the Clinton tax rates, period?  No ifs, ands, or buts -- any room in negotiating on that specific aspect of the fiscal cliff? President Obama:  I am withholding judgment with respect to how the entire process surrounding General Petraeus came up.  We dont have all the information yet, but I want to say that I have a lot of confidence generally in the FBI, and theyve got a difficult job.  And so Im going to wait and see to see if theres any other -- Question:  -- that you should have known?  Do you think in hindsight -- President Obama:  Well, I mean, Chuck, what Ill say is, is that if -- it is also possible that had we been told, then youd be sitting here asking a question about why were you interfering in a criminal investigation.  So I think its best right now for us to just see how this whole process unfolded. With respect to the tax rates, I just want to emphasize I am open to new ideas.  If Republican counterparts or some Democrats have a great idea for us to raise revenue, maintain progressivity, make sure the middle class isnt getting hit, reduces our deficit, encourages growth, Im not going to just slam the door in their face.  I want to hear ideas from everybody. Question:  -- red line. President Obama:  Look, I believe this is solvable.  I think that fair-minded people can come to an agreement that does not cause the economy to go back into recession, that protects middle-class families, that focuses on jobs and growth, and reduces our deficit.  Im confident it can be done. My budget, frankly, does it.  I understand that -- I dont expect the Republicans simply to adopt my budget.  Thats not realistic.  So I recognize that we're going to have to compromise.  And as I said on Election Night, compromise is hard, and not everybody gets 100 percent of what they want and not everybody is going to be perfectly happy. But what I will not do is to have a process that is vague, that says we're going to sort of, kind of, raise revenue through dynamic scoring or closing loopholes that have not been identified.  And the reason I won't do that is because I dont want to find ourselves in a position six months from now or a year from now where, lo and behold, the only way to close the deficit is to sock it to middle-class families, or to burden families that have disabled kids or have a parent in a nursing home, or suddenly we've got to cut more out of our basic research budget that is the key to growing the economy in the long term. So thats my concern.  I'm less concerned about red lines, per se.  What I'm concerned about is not finding ourselves in a situation where the wealthy aren't paying more or aren't paying as much as they should, middle-class families one way or another are making up the difference -- thats the kind of status quo that has been going on here too long, and thats exactly what I argued against during this campaign.  And if theres one thing that I'm pretty confident about is the American people understood what they were getting when they gave me this incredible privilege of being in office for another four years.  They want compromise.  They want action.  But they also want to make sure that middle-class folks aren't bearing the entire burden and sacrifice when it comes to some of these big challenges.  They expect that folks at the top are doing their fair share as well.  And thats going to be my guiding principle during these negotiations, but, more importantly, during the next four years of my administration. Nancy Cordes. Question:  Mr. President, on Election Night, you said that you were looking forward to speaking with Governor Romney, sitting down in the coming weeks to discuss ways that you could work together on this nation's problems.  Have you extended that invitation?  Has he accepted?  And in what ways do you think you can work together? President Obama:  We haven't scheduled something yet.  I think everybody forgets that the election was only a week ago and -- I know I've forgotten.  I forgot on Wednesday.  So I think everybody needs to catch their breath.  I'm sure that Governor Romney is spending some time with his family. And my hope is, before the end of the year, though, that we have a chance to sit down and talk.  There are certain aspects of Governor Romneys record and his ideas that I think could be very helpful.  Question:  Such as? President Obama:  Well, to give you one example, I do think he did a terrific job running the Olympics.  And that skill set of trying to figure out how do we make something work better applies to the federal government.  There are a lot of ideas that I dont think are partisan ideas but are just smart ideas about how can we make the federal government more customer friendly; how can we make sure that were consolidating programs that are duplicative; how can we eliminate additional waste.  He presented some ideas during the course of the campaign that I actually agree with.  So it would be interesting to talk to him about something like that. There may be ideas that he has with respect to jobs and growth that can help middle-class families that I want to hear. So Im not either prejudging what hes interested in doing, nor am I suggesting Ive got some specific assignment.  But what I want to do is to get ideas from him and see if there are some ways that we can potentially work together. Question:   But when it comes to your relationships with Congress, one of the most frequent criticisms weve heard over the past few years from members on both sides is that you havent done enough to reach out and build relationships.  Are there concrete ways that you plan to approach your relationships with Congress in a second term? President Obama:  Look, I think theres no doubt that I can always do better, and so I will examine ways that I can make sure to communicate my desire to work with everybody, so long as its advancing the cause of strengthening our middle class and improving our economy.  Ive got a lot of good relationships with folks both in the House and the Senate.  I have a lot of relationships on both sides of the aisle.  It hasnt always manifested itself in the kind of agreements that Id like to see between Democrats and Republicans.  And so I think all of us have responsibilities to see if there are things that we can improve on.  And I dont exempt myself from needing to do some self-reflection and see if I can improve our working relationship.  There are probably going to be still some very sharp differences.  And as I said during the campaign, there are going to be times where there are fights, and I think those are fights that need to be had.  But what I think the American people dont want to see is a focus on the next election instead of a focus on them.  And I dont have another election.  And Michelle and I were talking last night about what an incredible honor and privilege it is to be put in this position.  And there are people all across this country, millions of folks, who worked so hard to help us get elected, but there are also millions of people who may not have voted for us but are also counting on us.  And we take that responsibility very seriously.  I take that responsibility very seriously.  And I hope and intend to be an even better President in the second term than I was in the first. Jonathan Karl. Question:   Thank you, Mr. President.  Senator John McCain and Senator Lindsey Graham both said today that they want to have Watergate-style hearings on the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, and said that if you nominate Susan Rice to be Secretary of State, they will do everything in their power to block her nomination.  As Senator Graham said, he simply doesnt trust Ambassador Rice after what she said about Benghazi.  Id like your reaction to that.  And would those threats deter you from making a nomination like that? President Obama:  Well, first of all, Im not going to comment at this point on various nominations that Ill put forward to fill out my Cabinet for the second term.  Those are things that are still being discussed. But let me say specifically about Susan Rice, she has done exemplary work.  She has represented the United States and our interests in the United Nations with skill and professionalism and toughness and grace.  As Ive said before, she made an appearance at the request of the White House in which she gave her best understanding of the intelligence that had been provided to her.  If Senator McCain and Senator Graham and others want to go after somebody, they should go after me.  And Im happy to have that discussion with them.  But for them to go after the U.N. Ambassador, who had nothing to do with Benghazi, and was simply making a presentation based on intelligence that she had received, and to besmirch her reputation is outrageous.  And were after an election now.  I think it is important for us to find out exactly what happened in Benghazi, and Im happy to cooperate in any ways that Congress wants.  We have provided every bit of information that we have, and we will continue to provide information.  And weve got a full-blown investigation, and all that information will be disgorged to Congress.  And I don't think theres any debate in this country that when you have four Americans killed, that's a problem.  And weve got to get to the bottom of it, and there needs to be accountability.  Weve got to bring those who carried it out to justice.  They wont get any debate from me on that. But when they go after the U.N. Ambassador, apparently because they think shes an easy target, then theyve got a problem with me.  And should I choose, if I think that she would be the best person to serve America in the capacity of the State Department, then I will nominate her.  That's not a determination that Ive made yet. Ed Henry. Question:   I want to take Chucks lead and just ask a very small follow-up, which is whether you feel you have a mandate not just on taxes but on a range of issues because of your decisive victory?  But I want to stay on Benghazi, based on what Jon asked because you said, if they want to come after me, come after me.  I wanted to ask about the families of these four Americans who were killed.  Sean Smiths father, Ray, said he believes his son basically called 911 for help and they didn't get it.  And I know youve said you grieve for these four Americans, that its being investigated, but the families have been waiting for more than two months.  So I would like to -- for you to address the families, if you can.  On 9/11, as Commander-in-Chief, did you issue any orders to try to protect their lives? President Obama:  Ed, Ill address the families not through the press.  Ill address the families directly, as I already have.  And we will provide all the information that is available about what happened on that day.  Thats what the investigation is for.  But as Ive said repeatedly, if people dont think that we did everything we can to make sure that we saved the lives of folks who I sent there and who were carrying out missions on behalf of the United States, then you dont know how our Defense Department thinks or our State Department thinks or our CIA thinks.  Their number-one priority is obviously to protect American lives.  Thats what our job is.  Now -- Question:  [Inaudible.] President Obama:  Ed, I will put forward every bit of information that we have.  I can tell you that immediately upon finding out that our folks were in danger, that my orders to my national security team were do whatever we need to do to make sure theyre safe.  And thats the same order that I would give any time that I see Americans are in danger, whether theyre civilian or military, because thats our number-one priority. With respect to the issue of mandate, Ive got one mandate. Ive got a mandate to help middle-class families and families that are working hard to try to get into the middle class.  Thats my mandate.  Thats what the American people said.  They said:  Work really hard to help us.  Dont worry about the politics of it; dont worry about the party interests; dont worry about the special interests.  Just work really hard to see if you can help us get ahead -- because were working really hard out here and were still struggling, a lot of us.  Thats my mandate. I dont presume that because I won an election that everybody suddenly agrees with me on everything.  Im more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms.  We are very cautious about that.  On the other hand, I didnt get reelected just to bask in reelection.  I got elected to do work on behalf of American families and small businesses all across the country who are still recovering from a really bad recession, but are hopeful about the future.  And I am, too.  The one thing that I said during the campaign that maybe sounds like a bunch of campaign rhetoric, but now that the campaign is over I am going to repeat it and hopefully you guys will really believe me -- when you travel around the country, you are inspired by the grit and resilience and hard work and decency of the American people.  And it just makes you want to work harder.  You meet families who are -- have overcome really tough odds and somehow are making it and sending their kids to college.  And you meet young people who are doing incredible work in disadvantaged communities because they believe in the American ideal and it should available for everybody.  And you meet farmers who are helping each other during times of drought, and you meet businesses that kept their doors open during the recession, even though the owner didnt have to take a salary.  And when you talk to these folks, you say to yourself, man, they deserve a better government than they've been getting.  They deserve all of us here in Washington to be thinking every single day, how can I make things a little better for them -- which isn't to say that everything we do is going to be perfect, or that there aren't just going to be some big, tough challenges that we have to grapple with.  But I do know the federal government can make a difference.  We're seeing it right now on the Jersey coast and in New York.  People are still going through a really tough time; the response hasn't been perfect; but it's been aggressive and strong and fast and robust, and a lot of people have been helped because of it.  And thats a pretty good metaphor for how I want the federal government to operate generally, and I'm going to do everything I can to make sure it does. Christi Parson.  Hey.  Question:  Thank you, Mr. President, and congratulations, by the way.  President Obama:  Thanks.  Question:  One quick follow up -- President Obama:  Christi was there when I was running for state Senate. Question:  Thats right, I was.  President Obama:  So Christi and I go back a ways. Question:  I've never seen you lose.  I wasn't looking that one time. President Obama:  There you go.    Question:  One quick follow-up, and then I want to ask you about Iran.  I just want to make sure I understood what you said.  Can you envision any scenario in which we do go off the fiscal cliff at the end of the year?  And on Iran, are you preparing a final diplomatic push here to resolve the nuclear program issue, and are we headed toward one-on-one talks? President Obama:  Well, obviously, we can all imagine a scenario where we go off the fiscal cliff.  If despite the election, if despite the dangers of going over the fiscal cliff and what that means for our economy, that theres too much stubbornness in Congress that we can't even agree on giving middle-class families a tax cut, then middle-class families are all going to end up having a big tax hike.  And thats going to be a pretty rude shock for them, and I suspect will have a big impact on the holiday shopping season, which, in turn, will have an impact on business planning and hiring, and we can go back into a recession.  It would be a bad thing.  It is not necessary.  So I want to repeat:  Step number one that we can take in the next couple of weeks, provide certainty to middle-class families -- 98 percent of families who make less than $250,000 a year, 97 percent of small businesses -- that their taxes will not go up a single dime next year.  Give them that certainty right now.  We can get that done.  We can then set up a structure whereby we are dealing with tax reform, closing deductions, closing loopholes, simplifying, dealing with entitlements.  And Im ready and willing to make big commitments to make sure that were locking in the kind of deficit reductions that stabilize our deficit, start bringing it down, start bringing down our debt.  Im confident we can do it. And, look, Ive been living with this for a couple of years now.  I know the math pretty well.  And it really is arithmetic; its not calculus.  There are some tough things that have to be done, but there is a way of doing this that does not hurt middle-class families, that does not hurt our seniors, doesnt hurt families with disabled kids, allows us to continue to invest in those things that make us grow, like basic research and education, helping young people afford going to college.  As weve already heard from some Republican commentators, a modest tax increase on the wealthy is not going to break their backs; theyll still be wealthy.  And it will not impinge on business investment.  So we know how to do this.  This is just a matter of whether or not we come together and go ahead and say, Democrats and Republicans, were both going to hold hands and do whats right for the American people.  And I hope thats what happens. With respect to Iran, I very much want to see a diplomatic resolution to the problem.  I was very clear before the campaign, I was clear during the campaign, and Im now clear after the campaign -- were not going to let Iran get a nuclear weapon.  But I think there is still a window of time for us to resolve this diplomatically.  Weve imposed the toughest sanctions in history.  It is having an impact on Irans economy.  There should be a way in which they can enjoy peaceful nuclear power while still meeting their international obligations and providing clear assurances to the international community that theyre not pursuing a nuclear weapon.  And so, yes, I will try to make a push in the coming months to see if we can open up a dialogue between Iran and not just us, but the international community, to see if we can get this things resolved.  I cant promise that Iran will walk through the door that they need to walk through, but that would be very much the preferable option. Question:  And under what circumstances would one-on-one conversations take place? President Obama:  I wont talk about the details in negotiations.  But I think its fair to say we want to get this resolved, and were not going to be constrained by diplomatic niceties or protocols.  If Iran is serious about wanting to resolve this, theyll be in a position to resolve it. Question:  At one point just prior to the election that was talk that talks might be imminent.   President Obama:  That was not true, and its not true as of today. Just going to knock through a couple others.  Mark Landler.  Wheres Mark?  There he is right in front of me. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  In his endorsement of you a few weeks ago, Mayor Bloomberg said he was motivated by the belief that you would do more to confront the threat of climate change than your opponent.  Tomorrow youre going up to New York City where youre going to, I assume, see people who are still suffering the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which many people say is further evidence of how a warming globe is changing our weather.  What specifically do you plan to do in a second term to tackle the issue of climate change?  And do you think the political will exists in Washington to pass legislation that could include some kind of attacks on carbon?  President Obama:  As you know, Mark, we cant attribute any particular weather event to climate change.  What we do know is the temperature around the globe is increasing faster than was predicted even 10 years ago.  We do know that the Arctic ice cap is melting faster than was predicted even five years ago.  We do know that there have been extraordinarily -- there have been an extraordinarily large number of severe weather events here in North America, but also around the globe. And I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions.  And as a consequence, I think we've got an obligation to future generations to do something about it. Now, in my first term, we doubled fuel efficiency standards on cars and trucks.  That will have an impact.  That will take a lot of carbon out of the atmosphere.  We doubled the production of clean energy, which promises to reduce the utilization of fossil fuels for power generation.  And we continue to invest in potential breakthrough technologies that could further remove carbon from our atmosphere.  But we haven't done as much as we need to. So what I'm going to be doing over the next several weeks, next several months, is having a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation with scientists, engineers, and elected officials to find out what can -- what more can we do to make a short-term progress in reducing carbons, and then working through an education process that I think is necessary -- a discussion, a conversation across the country about what realistically can we do long term to make sure that this is not something we're passing on to future generations that's going to be very expensive and very painful to deal with. I don't know what either Democrats or Republicans are prepared to do at this point, because this is one of those issues that's not just a partisan issue; I also think there are regional differences.  Theres no doubt that for us to take on climate change in a serious way would involve making some tough political choices.  And understandably, I think the American people right now have been so focused, and will continue to be focused on our economy and jobs and growth, that if the message is somehow we're going to ignore jobs and growth simply to address climate change, I don't think anybody is going to go for that.  I won't go for that. If, on the other hand, we can shape an agenda that says we can create jobs, advance growth, and make a serious dent in climate change and be an international leader, I think that's something that the American people would support. So you can expect that youll hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward. Question:  Sounds like you're saying, though, in the current environment, we're probably still short of a consensus on some kind of attack. President Obama:  That I'm pretty certain of.  And, look, we're still trying to debate whether we can just make sure that middle-class families don't get a tax hike.  Lets see if we can resolve that.  That should be easy.  This one is hard -- but its important because one of the things that we don't always factor in are the costs involved in these natural disasters; we just put them off as something that's unconnected to our behavior right now.  And I think what -- based on the evidence we're seeing, is that what we do now is going to have an impact and a cost down the road if we dont do something about it. All right, last question.  Mark Felsenthal.  Wheres Mark? Question:  Thank you.  Mr. President, the Assad regime is engaged in a brutal crackdown on its people.  France has recognized the opposition coalition.  What would it take for the United States to do the same?  And is there any point at which the United States would consider arming the rebels?", "filename": "14November2012FirstPressConferenceFollowingPresidentialReelection.txt"}, {"question": "Over the past few days, I think all of us have been shaken by the images of the devastation wrought by Typhoon Haiyan.  Its a heartbreaking reminder of how fragile life is, and among the dead are several Americans.  So our prayers are with the Filipino people, and with Filipino Americans across our country who are anxious about their family and friends back home. One of our core principles is, when friends are in trouble, America helps.  As I told President Aquino earlier this week, the United States will continue to offer whatever assistance we can.  Our military personnel and USAID team do this better than anybody in the world, and theyve been already on the ground working tirelessly to deliver food, water, medicine, shelter, and to help with airlift.  Today, the aircraft carrier USS George Washington and other ships arrived to help with search- and-rescue, as well as supplies, medical care and logistical support.  And more help is on the way. Americas strength, of course, has always been more than just about what our government can do - its also about what our citizens can do.  Its about the big-heartedness of the American people when they see other folks in trouble.  So today, I would encourage everybody who wants to help, to visit WhiteHouse.gov/typhoon -- that's WhiteHouse.gov/typhoon -- and that will offer you links to organizations that are working on the ground and ways that you can support their efforts.  Our friends in the Philippines will face a long, hard road ahead, but theyll continue to have a friend and partner in the United States of America. Now, switching gears, it has now been six weeks since the Affordable Care Acts new marketplace has opened for business.  I think it's fair to say that the rollout has been rough so far.  And I think everybody understands that I'm not happy about the fact that the rollout has been wrought with a whole range of problems that I've been deeply concerned about.  But today I want to talk about what we know after these first few weeks and what we're doing to implement and improve the law. Yesterday, the White House announced that in the first month, more than 100,000 Americans successfully enrolled in new insurance plans.  Is that as high a number as wed like?", "filename": "14November2013AffordableCareActChangesPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Already, people who have plans that predate the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they havent changed.  That was already in the law.  That's what's called a grandfather clause.  It was included in the law.  Today, we're going to extend that principle both to people whose plans have changed since the law took effect, and to people who bought plans since the law took effect. So state insurance commissioners still have the power to decide what plans can and cant be sold in their states.  But the bottom line is, insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be canceled into 2014, and Americans whose plans have been canceled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan. Were also requiring insurers to extend current plans to inform their customers about two things.  One, that protections -- what protections these renewed plans dont include.  And number two, that the marketplace offers new options with better coverage and tax credits that might help you bring down the cost. So if youve received one of these letters, Id encourage you to take a look at the marketplace.  Even if the website isnt working as smoothly as it should be for everybody yet, the plan comparison tool that lets you browse costs for new plans near you is working just fine. Now, this fix wont solve every problem for every person.  But its going to help a lot of people.  Doing more will require work with Congress.  And Ive said from the beginning, Im willing to work with Democrats and Republicans to fix problems as they arise.  This is an example of what I was talking about.  We can always make this law work better.  It is important to understand, though, that the old individual market was not working well.  And its important that we dont pretend that somehow thats a place worth going back to.  Too often, it works fine as long as you stay healthy; it doesnt work well when youre sick.  So year after year, Americans were routinely exposed to financial ruin, or denied coverage due to minor preexisting conditions, or dropped from coverage altogether -- even if they paid their premiums on time.  Thats one of the reasons we pursued this reform in the first place.  And thats why I will not accept proposals that are just another brazen attempt to undermine or repeal the overall law and drag us back into a broken system.  We will continue to make the case, even to folks who choose to keep their own plans, that they should shop around in the new marketplace because theres a good chance that theyll be able to buy better insurance at lower cost. So were going to do everything we can to help the Americans who have received these cancellation notices.  But I also want everybody to remember there are still 40 million Americans who dont have health insurance at all.  Im not going to walk away from 40 million people who have the chance to get health insurance for the first time.  And Im not going to walk away from something that has helped the cost of health care grow at its slowest rate in 50 years. So were at the opening weeks of the project to build a better health care system for everybody -- a system that will offer real financial security and peace of mind to millions of Americans.  It is a complex process.  There are all kinds of challenges.  Im sure there will be additional challenges that come up.  And its important that were honest and straightforward in terms of when we come up with a problem with these reforms and these laws, that we address them.  But weve got to move forward on this.  It took 100 years for us to even get to the point where we could start talking about and implementing a law to make sure everybody has got health insurance.  And my pledge to the American people is, is that were going to solve the problems that are there, were going to get it right, and the Affordable Care Act is going to work for the American people.  So with that, Im going to take your questions, and Im going to start with Julie Pace of AP.  Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  The combination of the website problems and the concerns over the policy cancellations has sparked a lot of worry within your own party, and polls also show that youre taking some hits with the public on both your overall job approval rating and also on factors like trust and honesty.  Do you feel as though the flawed health care rollout has led to a breach in the public trust and confidence in government?  And if so, how do you plan to resolve that? President Obama:  There is no doubt that people are frustrated.  We just came out of a shutdown and the possibility that for the first time in over 200 years, we wouldnt pay our bills.  And people breathed a sigh of relief when that finally got done, and the next thing they know is, is that the Presidents health care reform cant get the website to work and that there are these other problems with respect to cancellation notices.  And I understand why folks are frustrated.  I would be, too.  Because sometimes people look at whats taking place in Washington and they say, not enough is getting done that helps me with my life.  And regardless of what Congress does, ultimately Im the President of the United States and they expect me to do something about it.  So in terms of how I intend to approach it, Im just going to keep on working as hard as I can around the priorities that the American people care about.  And I think its legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular, and on a whole range of these issues in general.  And thats on me.  I mean, we fumbled the rollout on this health care law.  There are a whole bunch of things about it that are working really well which people didnt notice because they werent controversial -- so making sure kids could stay on their parents plans until they were -- through the age of 25, and making sure that seniors got more discounts on their prescription drugs.  There were a whole bunch of stuff that we did well over the first three years.  But we always knew that these marketplaces, creating a place where people can shop and through competition get a better deal for the health insurance that their families need, we always knew that that was going to be complicated and everybody was going to be paying a lot of attention to it.  And we should have done a better job getting that right on day one -- not on day 28 or on day 40. I am confident that by the time we look back on this next year, that people are going to say this is working well, and its helping a lot of people.  But my intention in terms of winning back the confidence of the American people is just to work as hard as I can; identify the problems that weve got, make sure that were fixing them.  Whether its a website, whether it is making sure that folks who got these cancellation notices get help, were just going to keep on chipping away at this until the job is done.  Major Garrett. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You said while the law was being debated, if you like your plan, you can keep it.  You said after the law was implemented or signed, if you like your plan, you can keep it.  Americans believed you, sir, when you said that to them over and over.  Do you not believe, sir, the American people deserve a deeper, more transparent accountability from you as to why you said that over and over when your own statistic published in the Federal Register alerted your policy staff -- and I presume you -- to the fact that millions of Americans would, in fact, probably fall into the very gap youre trying to administratively fix now? That's one question.  Second question.  (Laughter.)  You were informed, or several people in this building were informed two weeks before the launch of the website that it was failing the most basic tests internally, and yet a decision was made to launch the website on October 1st.  Did you, sir, make that test?  And if so, did you regret that? President Obama:  Okay, on the website, I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to.  Had I been informed, I wouldnt be going out saying, boy, this is going to be great.  Im accused of a lot of things, but I don't think Im stupid enough to go around saying, this is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity a week before the website opens if I thought that it wasnt going to work.  So clearly, we and I did not have enough awareness about the problems in the website.  Even a week into it, the thinking was that these were some glitches that would be fixed with patches, as opposed to some broader systemic problems that took much longer to fix and were still working on them. So that doesn't excuse the fact that they just don't work.  But I think its fair to say that, no, Garrett -- Major, we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasnt going to work the way it was supposed, given all the scrutiny that we knew was going to be on the website. With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan, you can keep it, I think -- and Ive said in interviews -- that there is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate.  It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise.  We put a grandfather clause into the law, but it was insufficient.  Keep in mind that the individual market accounts for 5 percent of the population.  So when I said you can keep your health care, Im looking at folks whove got employer-based health care; Im looking at folks whove got Medicare and Medicaid -- and that accounts for the vast majority of Americans.  And then for people who don't have any health insurance at all, obviously that didn't apply.  My commitment to them was, you're going to be able to get affordable health care for the first time. You have an individual market that accounts for about 5 percent of the population.  And our working assumption was -- my working assumption was that the majority of those folks would find better policies at lower costs or the same costs in the marketplaces, and that the universe of folks who potentially would not find a better deal in the marketplaces, the grandfather clause would work sufficiently for them.  And it didn't.  And again, that's on us.  Which is why were -- that's on me.  And that's why Im trying to fix it. And as I said earlier, I guess last week, and I will repeat, that's something I deeply regret because its scary getting a cancellation notice. Now, it is important to understand that out of that population, typically there is constant churn in that market.  This market is not very stable and reliable for people.  So people have a lot of complaints when they're in that marketplace.  As long as you're healthy, things seem to be going pretty good.  And so a lot of people think, Ive got pretty good insurance -- until they get sick -- and then suddenly they look at the fine print, and theyve got a $50,000 out-of-pocket expense that they can't pay. We know that on average over the last decade, each year, premiums in that individual market would go up an average of 15 percent a year.  I know that because when we were talking about health care reform, one of the complaints was:  I bought health care in the individual market and I just got a notice from the insurer, they dropped me after I had an illness; or my premium skyrocketed by 20 or 30 percent, why arent we doing something about this? So part of what our goal has been is to make sure that that individual market is stable and fair, and has the kind of consumer protections that make sure that people dont get a rude surprise when they really need health insurance.  But if you just got a cancellation notice, and so far youre thinking, my prices are pretty good, you havent been sick, and it fits your budget, and now you get this notice -- youre going to be worried about it.  And if the insurer is saying the reason youre getting this notice is because of the Affordable Care Act, then youre going to be understandably aggravated about it. Now, for a big portion of those people, the truth is they might have gotten a notice saying, were jacking up your rates by 30 percent.  They might have said, from here on out, were not going to cover X, Y and Z illnesses, were changing the -- because these were all 12-month policies.  The insurance companies were under no obligation to renew the exact same policies that you had before. But, look, one of the things I understood when we decided to reform that health insurance market, part of the reason why it hasnt been done before and its very difficult to do, is that anything thats going on thats tough in the health care market, if you initiated a reform, can be attributed to your law.  And so what we want to do is to be able to say to these folks, you know what, the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the reason why insurers have to cancel your plan. Now, what folks may find is the insurance companies may still come back and say, we want to charge you 20 percent more than we did last year; or were not going to cover prescription drugs now.  But thats in the nature of the market that existed earlier. Question:  Did you decide, sir, that the simple declaration was something the American people could handle, but this nuanced answer you just gave now was something that you couldnt handle and you didnt trust the American people with a fuller truth? President Obama:  No.  I think, as I said earlier, Major, my expectation was that for 98 percent of the American people, either it genuinely wouldn't change at all, or they'd be pleasantly surprised with the options in the marketplace, and that the grandfather clause would cover the rest.  That proved not to be the case.  And that's on me.  And the American people -- those who got cancellation notices do deserve and have received an apology from me.  But they don't want just words.  What they want is whether we can make sure that they are in a better place, and that we meet that commitment. And, by the way, I think it's very important for me to note that there are a whole bunch of folks up in Congress and others who made this statement, and they were entirely sincere about it.  And the fact that you've got this percentage of people who have had this impact -- I want them to know that their senator or congressman, they were making representations based on what I told them and what this White House and our administrative staff told them.  And so it's not on them.  It's on us.  But it is something that we intend to fix. Steve Collinson. Question:  Do you have reason to believe that Iran would walk away from nuclear talks if Congress draws up new sanctions?  And would a diplomatic breakdown at this stage leave you no option but military action?  And how do you respond to your critics on the Hill who say that it was only tough sanctions that got Iran to the table, but only tougher sanctions will make it capitulate? President Obama:  Well, let me make a couple of points.  Number one, I've said before and I will repeat:  We do not want Iran having nuclear weapons.  And it would be not only dangerous to us and our allies, but it would be destabilizing to the entire region, and could trigger a nuclear arms race that would make life much more dangerous for all of us.  So our policy is Iran cannot have nuclear weapons.  And I'm leaving all options on the table to make sure that we meet that goal. Point number two:  The reason we've got such vigorous sanctions is because I and my administration put in place, when I came into office, the international structure to have the most effective sanctions ever.  And so I think it's fair to say that I know a little bit about sanctions, since we've set them up, and made sure that we mobilize the entire international community so that there weren't a lot of loopholes and they really had bite. And the intention in setting up those sanctions always was to bring the Iranians to the table so that we could resolve this issue peacefully, because that is my preference.  That's my preference because any armed conflict has cost to it, but it's also my preference because the best way to assure that a country does not have nuclear weapons is that they are making a decision not to have nuclear weapons, and we're in a position to verify that they don't have nuclear weapons. So as a consequence of the sanctions that we put in place  -- and I appreciate all the help, bipartisan help, that we received from Congress in making that happen -- Iran's economy has been crippled.  They had a -5 percent growth rate last year.  Their currency plummeted.  They're having significant problems in just the day-to-day economy on the ground in Iran.  And President Rouhani made a decision that he was prepared to come and have a conversation with the international community about what they could do to solve this problem with us.  We've now had a series of conversations, and it has never been realistic that we would resolve the entire problem all at once.  What we have done is seen the possibility of an agreement in which Iran would halt advances on its program; that it would dilute some of the highly enriched uranium that makes it easier for them to potentially produce a weapon; that they are subjecting themselves to much more vigorous inspections so that we know exactly what theyre doing at all their various facilities; and that that would then provide time and space for us to test, over a certain period of months, whether or not they are prepared to actually resolve this issue to the satisfaction of the international community -- making us confident that, in fact, theyre not pursuing a nuclear weapons program. In return, the basic structure of whats been talked about, although not completed, is that we would provide very modest relief at the margins of the sanctions that weve set up.  But importantly, we would leave in place the core sanctions that are most effective and have most impact on the Iranian economy, specifically oil sanctions and sanctions with respect to banks and financing.  And what that gives us is the opportunity to test how serious are they, but it also gives us an assurance that if it turns out six months from now that theyre not serious, we can crank -- we can dial those sanctions right back up.   So my message to Congress has been that, lets see if this short-term, phase-one deal can be completed to our satisfaction where were absolutely certain that while were talking with the Iranians, theyre not busy advancing their program.  We can buy some additional months in terms of their breakout capacity.  Lets test how willing they are to actually resolve this diplomatically and peacefully.  We will have lost nothing if, at the end of the day, it turns out that they are not prepared to provide the international community the hard proof and assurances necessary for us to know that theyre not pursuing a nuclear weapon.  And if that turns out to be the case, then not only is our entire sanctions infrastructure still in place, not only are they still losing money from the fact that they cant sell their oil and get revenue from their oil as easily, even throughout these talks, but other options remain.  But what Ive said to members of Congress is that if, in fact, were serious about trying to resolve this diplomatically -- because no matter how good our military is, military options are always messy, theyre always difficult, always have unintended consequences, and in this situation are never complete in terms of making us certain that they dont then go out and pursue even more vigorously nuclear weapons in the future -- if were serious about pursuing diplomacy, then theres no need for us to add new sanctions on top of the sanctions that are already very effective and that brought them to the table in the first place. Now, if it turns out they cant deliver, they cant come to the table in a serious way and get this issue resolved, the sanctions can be ramped back up.  And weve got that option. All right.  Roger Runningen.  Roger, its his birthday, by the way.  So thats not the reason you got a question, but I thought it was important to note that. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama:  Happy birthday. Question:  Back to health care.  Can you guarantee for the American people that the health care website is going to be fully operational for all people, not just the vast majority, by November 30?  And second, more broadly, this is your signature domestic piece of legislation.  You hear criticism on the Hill that you and your White House team are too insular.  Is that how this mess came to be? President Obama:  Well, I think there is going to be a lot of evaluation of how we got to this point.  And I assure you that Ive been asking a lot of questions about that.  The truth is that this is, number one, very complicated.  The website itself is doing a lot of stuff.  There arent a lot of websites out there that have to help people compare their possible insurance options, verify income to find out what kind of tax credits they might get, communicate with those insurance companies so they can purchase, make sure that all of its verified.  So theres just a bunch of pieces to it that made it challenging. And you combine that with the fact that the federal government does a lot of things really well.  One of the things it does not do well is information technology procurement.  This is kind of a systematic problem that we have across the board.  And it is not surprising then that there were going to be some problems. Now, I think we have to ask ourselves some hard questions inside the White House as opposed to why we didn't see more of these problems coming earlier on -- A, so we could set expectations; B, so that we could look for different ways for people to end up applying.  So ultimately, youre right.  This is something that's really important to me, and its really important to millions of Americans who have been waiting for a really long time to try to get health care because they don't have it.  And I am very frustrated, but Im also somebody who, if I fumbled the ball, Im going to wait until I get the next play, and then Im going to try to run as hard as I can and do right by the team.  So ultimately, Im the head of this team.  We did fumble the ball on it, and what Im going to do is make sure that we get it fixed. In terms of what happens on November 30th or December 1st, I think its fair to say that the improvement will be marked and noticeable.  The website will work much better on November 30th, December 1st than it worked certainly on October 1st.  That's a pretty low bar.  It will be working a lot better than it is -- it was last week, and it will be working better than it was this week, which means that the majority of people who go to the website will see a website that is working the way its supposed to. I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience.  Were going to have to continue to improve it even after November 30th, December 1st.  But the majority of people who use it will be able to see it operate the way it was supposed to. One thing that weve discovered, though, that I think is worth noting:  A lot of focus has been on the website and the technology, and that's partly because that's how we initially identified it -- these are glitches.  What were discovering is that part of the problem has been technology -- hardware and software -- and that's being upgraded.  But even if we get the hardware and software working exactly the way its supposed to with relatively minor glitches, what were also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy.  And another mistake that we made I think was underestimating the difficulties of people purchasing insurance online and shopping for a lot of options with a lot of costs and a lot of different benefits and plans, and somehow expecting that that would be very smooth.  And then theyve also got to try apply for tax credits on the website.  So what were doing even as were trying to solve the technical problems is also what can we do to make the application a little bit simpler; what can we do to make it in English as opposed to bureaucratese; are there steps that we can skip while still getting the core information that people need And part of what were realizing is that they are going to be a certain portion of people who are just going to need more help and more handholding in the application process.  And so I guess part of the continuous improvement that Im looking at is not just a technical issue.  Its also, can we streamline the application process; what are we doing to give people more assistance in the application process; how do the call centers and the people who are helping folks in-person; how are they trained so that things can go more smoothly. Because the bottom line ultimately is, I just want people to know what their options are in a clear way.  And buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes.  Its just a much more complicated transaction.  But I think we can continue to make it better -- all of which is to say that on December 1st, November 30th, it will be a lot better, but there will still be some problems.  Some of those will not be because of technological problems -- although Im sure that there will still be some glitches that have to be smoothed out.  Some of its going to be how are we making this application process more user-friendly for folks. And one good example of this, by the way, just to use an analogy -- when we came into office, we heard a lot of complaints about the financial aid forms that families have to fill out to get federal financial aid.  And I actually remember applying for some of that stuff and remember how difficult and confusing it was.  And Arne Duncan over at Education worked with a team to see what we could do to simplify it, and it made a big difference. And that's part of the process that weve got to go through.  And in fact, if we can get some focus groups and we sit down with actual users and see how well is this working, what would improve it, what part of it didn't you understand --  that all I think is part of what were going to be working on in the weeks ahead. Question:  What about the insularity criticism that you hear on the Hill? President Obama:  Ive got to say I meet with an awful lot of folks, and I talk to an awful lot of folks every day.  And I have lunches with CEOs and IT venture capitalists and labor leaders and pretty much folks from all walks of life on a whole bunch of topics.  And if you looked at my schedule on any given day, were interacting with a whole lot of people. And I think its fair to say that we have a pretty good track record of working with folks on technology and IT from our campaign where, both in 2008 and 2012, we did a pretty darn good job on that.  So its not -- the idea that somehow we didn't have access or were interested in peoples ideas, I think isnt accurate.  What is true is that, as I said before, our IT systems, how we purchase technology in the federal government is cumbersome, complicated, and outdated.  And so this isnt a situation where on my campaign I could simply say, who are the best folks out there; lets get them around a table, lets figure out what were doing, and were just going to continue to improve it and refine it and work on our goals.  If you're doing it at the federal government level, you're going through 40 pages of specs and this and that and the other, and there are all kinds of laws involved, and it makes it more difficult.  It's part of the reason why, chronically, federal IT programs are over budget, behind schedule. And one of the -- when I do some Monday morning quarterbacking on myself, one of the things that I do recognize is -- since I know that the federal government has not been good at this stuff in the past -- two years ago, as we were thinking about this, we might have done more to make sure that we were breaking the mold on how we were going to be setting this up.  But that doesn't help us now.  We've got to move forward. Jeff Mason. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Today's fix that you just announced leaves it up to state insurance commissioners and insurance companies to ultimately decide whether to allow old policies to be renewed for a year.  How confident are you that they will do that?  And secondly, how concerned are you that this flawed rollout may hurt Democrats' chances in next year's midterm elections, and your ability to advance other priorities such as immigration reform? President Obama:  On the first question, traditionally, state insurance commissioners make decisions about what plans can be or cannot be sold, how they interact with insurers.  What we're essentially saying is the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the factor in what happens with folks in the individual market.  And my guess is right away you're going to see a number of state insurance commissioners exercise it. Part of the challenge is the individual markets are different in different states.  There are some states that have individual insurance markets that already have almost all the consumer protections that the Affordable Care Act does.  They match up pretty good.  It's not some big jump for folks to move into the marketplace.  In others, they're pretty low standards, so you can sell pretty substandard plans in those markets.  And that's where people might see a bigger jump in their premiums.  So I think there's going to be some state-by-state evaluation on how this is handled.  But the key point is, is that it allows us to be able to say to the folks who received these notices:  Look, I, the President of the United States and the insurance - that the insurance model, the Affordable Care Act, is not going to be getting in the way of you shopping in the individual market that you used to have.  As I said, there are still going to be some folks who over time, I think, are going to find that the marketplaces are better. One way I described this to -- I met with a group of senators when this issue first came up -- and it's not a perfect analogy -- but we made a decision as a society that every car has to have a seatbelt or airbags.  And so you pass a regulation.  And there are some additional costs, particularly at the start of increasing the safety and protections, but we make a decision as a society that the costs are outweighed by the benefits of all the lives that are saved.  So what we're saying now is if you're buying a new car, you got to have a seatbelt.  Well, the problem with the grandfather clause that we put in place is it's almost like we said to folks, you got to buy a new car, even if you can't afford it right now.  And sooner or later, folks are going to start trading in their old cars.  But we don't need -- if their life circumstance is such where, for now at least, they want to keep the old car, even if the new car is better, we should be able to give them that option.  And that's what we want to do. And, by the way, that's what we should have been able to do in drafting the rules in the first place.  So, again, these are two fumbles on something that -- on a big game, which -- but the game is not over. With respect to the politics of it, I'll let you guys do a lot of the work on projecting what this means for various political scenarios.  There is no doubt that our failure to roll out the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not, because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin.  And I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them rather than easier for them to continue to promote the core values that I think led them to support this thing in the first place -- which is, in this country, as wealthy as we are, everybody should be able to have the security of affordable health care.  And that's why I feel so strongly about fixing it.  My first and foremost obligation is the American people, to make sure that they can get what's there -- if we can just get the darn website working and smooth this thing out -- which is plans that are affordable, and allow them to take advantage of tax credits and give them a better deal.  But I also do feel an obligation to everybody out there who supported this effort.  When we don't do a good job on the rollout, we're letting them down.  And I don't like doing that.  So my commitment to them is, we're going to just keep on doing better every day until we get it done.  And in terms of the impact on me -- I think to some extent I addressed it when I talked to Julie -- there are going to be ups and downs during the course of my presidency.  And I think I said early on when I was running -- I am not a perfect man, and I will not be a perfect President, but I'll wake up every single day working as hard as I can on behalf of Americans out there from every walk of life who are working hard, meeting their responsibilities, but sometimes are struggling because the way the system works isn't giving them a fair shot. And that pledge I haven't broke.  That commitment, that promise, continues to be -- continues to hold -- the promise that I wouldn't be perfect, number one, but also the promise that as long as I've got the honor of having this office, I'm just going to work as hard as I can to make things better for folks.  And what that means specifically in this health care arena is we can't go back to the status quo.  I mean, right now everybody is properly focused on us not doing a good job on the rollout, and thats legitimate and I get it.  There have been times where I thought we were kind of slapped around a little bit unjustly.  This one is deserved.  Right?  Its on us.  But we cant lose sight of the fact that the status quo before the Affordable Care Act was not working at all.  If the health care system had been working fine, and everybody had high-quality health insurance at affordable prices, I wouldnt have made it a priority; we wouldnt have been fighting this hard to get it done -- which is why, when I see sometimes folks up on Capitol Hill, and Republicans in particular, who have been suggesting repeal, repeal, lets get rid of this thing, I keep on asking what is it that you want to do?  Are you suggesting that the status quo was working?  Because it wasnt, and everybody knows it.  It wasnt working in the individual market and it certainly wasnt working for the 41 million people who didnt have health insurance.  And so what we did was we chose a path that was the least disruptive, to try to finally make sure that health care is treated in this country like it is in every other advanced country -- that its not some privilege that just a certain portion of people can have, but its something that everybody has some confidence about.  And we didnt go far left and choose an approach that would have been much more disruptive.  We didnt adopt some more conservative proposals that would have been much more disruptive.  We tried to choose a way that built off the existing system.  But it is complicated, it is hard, but I make no apologies for us taking this on -- because somebody sooner or later had to do it.  I do make apologies for not having executed better over the last several months. Question:  And do you think that execution and the flaws in the rollout will affect your ability to do other things, like immigration reform and other policy priorities? President Obama:  Well, look, if it comes to immigration reform, there is no reason for us not to do immigration reform.  And weve already got strong bipartisan support for immigration reform out of the Senate.  Youve got -- I met with a number of traditionally very conservative clergy who are deeply committed to immigration reform.  Weve got the business community entirely behind immigration reform.  So youve got a bunch of constituencies that are traditionally much more -- have leaned much more heavily towards the Republicans who are behind this. So if people are looking for an excuse not to do the right thing on immigration reform, they can always find an excuse --  weve run out of time, or this is hard, or the list goes on and on.  But my working assumption is people should want to do the right thing.  And when youve got an issue that would strengthen borders, make sure that the legal immigration system works the way its supposed to, that would go after employers who have been doing the wrong thing when it comes to hiring undocumented workers, and would allow folks who are here illegally to get right with the law and pay a fine, and learn English and get to the back of the line, but ultimately join fully our American community -- when youve got a law that makes sense, you shouldnt be looking for an excuse not to do it.  And Im going to keep on pushing to make sure it gets done.  Am I going to have to do some work to rebuild confidence around some of our initiatives?  Yes.  But part of this job is the things that go right, you guys arent going to write about; the things that go wrong get prominent attention.  Thats how it has always been.  Thats not unique to me as President.  And Im up to the challenge.  Were going to get this done. All right?", "filename": "14November2013AffordableCareActChangesPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Let me just begin by saying what a great pleasure it is for me to welcome President Obama again to my house, and to be able to meet all of you. I would just like to say that there have been those who have been saying that there is tension between the United States and the National League for Democracy -- or perhaps with me. I would like to make quite clear that the friendship between the United States and those who have been struggling for democracy in Burma is a very strong one.  We may view things differently from time to time but it will in no way affect our friendship. And I have absolute confidence that the United States will continue to support us with regard to the democratic transformation and that when Burma becomes a fully functioning democracy in accordance with the will of the people, we will be able to say that among those friends who enabled us to get there, the United States was among the first. So please don't think -- please don't worry that there will be any problems between the United States and those working for democracy in Burma.  We all believe in the same values.  We all believe in the same principles.  We may sometimes think that there are different ways of getting to the goal that we wish to achieve, but these differences are part of the democratic tradition.  Democracy allows people to have different views, and democracy makes it also -- makes us also responsible for negotiating an answer to those views. I would like all of you to feel welcome in this country, and I would all -- like all of you to feel that you can join us in hoping for better days.  But at the same time, I always warn against over-optimism because that could lead to complacency. Our reform process is going through, lets us say, a bumpy...patch.  But this bumpy patch is something that we can negotiate with commitment and with the help and understanding of our friends from all over the world.  So let us not exaggerate the differences, the difficulties.  But at the same time, let us not exaggerate the rosy picture either. What we need is a healthy balance between optimism and pessimism.  We need to view the -- the situation for what it was.  But at the same time, we all have to be confident that we will get there -- we will get where we want to get to, because thats what our people want.  In the end, its the people of Burma who will decide where this country is going to and which way and how and when. So we accept responsibility for the fate of our country, but at the same time we welcome the support and the help of our friends.  And we always appreciate them very greatly. Thank you. Barack Obama:  Well, good afternoon, everybody.  Mingalaba.  It is wonderful to be back in Rangoon and to once more have the opportunity to spend time with Aung San Suu Kyi.  As we know, it was in this house that she endured years of confinement -- never giving up hope, never wavering in her determination to build a free and democratic Burma.  Daw Suu, you helped set this country on a better path.  Im grateful for your friendship and for the hospitality that youve shown in opening your home up not only to me, but to all these people. 3:46 When I made my first historic visit to Burma, this country was just taking preliminary steps towards democracy.  And in the past two years, important changes have been made.  The economy has begun to grow.  Political prisoners have been set free.  There are more newspapers and media outlets.  Children have been released from the military.  And these are all important changes that have opened up greater opportunity for the people of Burma. At the same time, as Aung San Suu Kyi just said, its clear how much hard work remains to be done and that many difficult choices still lie ahead.  The process for reform is by no means complete or irreversible.  For many, progress has not come fast enough or spread far enough.  People need to feel safe in their homes and not be subject to arbitrary harassment by authorities or individuals acting with impunity.  People need to be empowered to pursue their dreams.  And as Burma approaches important national elections next year, it will be critical to ensure that all of Burmas people can participate in shaping the future of their country. As a member of parliament and the head of the rule of law committee, Aung San Suu Kyi is working hard to make government more transparent, more accountable, to protect the rights of all the Burmese people, to promote reforms that would expand the political space for more people to contribute their voices.  But implementing the major political and economic reforms that are necessary to keep Burma advancing toward democracy is going to take a great deal of political will and no small amount of determination.  And we, as friends of the Burmese people, are clear-eyed about the scale of the challenges that remain, and recognize that we cannot remain complacent. Today, Daw Suu and I had a wide-ranging discussion about how the United States can help facilitate and bolster Burmas democratic transition.  We talked about the need for stronger rule of law, for elections that are free, fair and inclusive, and for continued constitutional changes that will move Burma more fully towards a civilian government. We spoke about how we can work together to promote national reconciliation and defuse sectarian tensions among Burmas diverse ethnic groups.  Specifically, I stressed the need to find durable and effective solutions for the terrible violence in Rakhine state -- solutions that end discrimination, provide greater security and economic opportunities, protect all citizens, and promote greater tolerance and understanding.  Strengthening human rights protections for all of Burmas people is an essential step to realizing the vision we share for the future of this beautiful country. The last time I stood here, I made a pledge to the people of Burma -- that if we continued to see progress toward reform, the ties between our countries would grow stronger, and the United States would continue to do whatever it could to help ensure Burmas success.  Over the last two years, I think weve made good on that pledge, and I want to reiterate the commitment to match continued reforms with greater support and friendships in the future. Were committed to working directly with the people of Burma, and not just the government.  So later today, Im looking forward to speaking with representatives of Burmas civil society groups and with young leaders from Burma and all across Southeast Asia who are working to create greater opportunities for themselves and for future generations.  I think these new voices are going to be critical to making sure that reforms are sustainable and meaningful to people across the country and across the region. So, Daw Suu, thank you again for welcoming us here today.  We continue to look to you for inspiration as well as resolve, and I know that you will continue to be a fierce advocate on behalf of the people of Burma, a future of democracy, and I know that you will be a strong partner with the United States. Thank you.  Questions? Daw Aung San Suu Kyi:  Whos speaking? Barack Obama: Ill go first.  Christi Parsons. Q:  You have been traveling in countries with long histories of repressing freedom of expression and censorship.  And it was interesting yesterday that President Xi seemed to be saying that reporters who have problems have themselves to blame.  And so I wonder to what extent you feel the need to contend with these ideas with leaders in this region as you travel.  And what do you say to them?  And by way of example, I might ask you -- Attorney General Eric Holder says no journalist will go to prison for doing his or her job, on his watch. And so I ask about the case of James Risen, the journalist who is facing this prosecution for not revealing his source in a leak prosecution.  I wonder if thats -- are you speaking specifically about this case, and is that your position as well? And if I may, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, ask you -- how concerned are you about the violence against ethnic minorities in your country, and specifically the Rohingya people?  And what do you believe is your responsibility to speak out about it?  Thank you very much.  Barack Obama:  The issue of press freedom is a constant concern in my interactions with the Chinese government.  Its an issue that Ive raised with the President here in Burma.  Im pretty blunt and pretty frank about the fact that societies that repress journalists ultimately oppress people as well, and that if you want a society that is free and vibrant and successful, part of that formula is the free flow of information, of ideas, and that requires a free press.  That is part of our tradition. As I explained to President Xi in China, its in our DNA.  We believe in the primacy individuals being able to pursue their dreams, endowed with certain inalienable rights.  And we believe that when governments censor or control information, that ultimately that undermines not only the society, but it leads to eventual encroachments on individual rights as well. I can't comment, Christi, on any particular pending case, as you know -- that's sort of an iron-clad rule -- or any particular prosecution.  I can read back to you what Attorney General Holder has said, which is no journalist is going to go to jail for doing their job.  And I don't think you're suggesting that there's -- that the two cases are comparable.  But I recognize that in our own society we have to constantly balance the need for certain national security issues to remain secret with journalists pursuing leads wherever they can.  And the good news is, is that we've got courts and we've got a First Amendment.  And we got a whole bunch of tools to ensure that that balance is properly debated and adjudicated.  But I think that when I am traveling, it is important as the President of the United States to not just talk about our interests, but also to talk about our values.  Sometimes it has an impact; sometimes it doesn't.  Although I was impressed that Mark Landler got an answer to his question from President Xi.  It might not have been the one he was expecting, but he did end up taking the question.  So you just keep on chipping away and seeing if we can make progress. Q: [Off-mic inaudible] Barack Obama:  Hold on a second, Christi.  Don't try to segue into a second question.  Daw Aung San Suu Kyi:  I think I better take over because I've got to have my time as well. Barack Obama:  There you go. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi:  The National League for Democracy always has been against violence of any kind, either on racial grounds, or religious grounds, or ideological grounds.  We do not believe that violence really resolves anything at all. Our struggle for democracy has been carried out with a strong grasp on the principle of nonviolence.  And also, we believe in the rule of law.  So if you ask how do we propose to resolve all of these problems of violence between communities, between different ethnic groups, we've got to start with rule of law.  People have to feel secure before they can start talking to one another.  We cannot achieve harmony without security.  People who feel threatened are not going to sit down and sort out their problems. So I would like to recommend, as the chair of the Rule of Law and Tranquility Committee -- don't forget that tranquility is also included -- that the government should look to rule of law.  It is the duty of the government to make all our people feel secure, and it is the duty of our people to learn to live in harmony with one another. If we want democracy, we have to be prepared to live by the principles of democracy.  We have to dare to live according to the principles of democracy.  I think we'll get there, but it will take us some time.  But we will remain fully committed to the principle of nonviolence. Q:  [inaudible] Mr. President, I'd like to know about the Myanmar reforms.  You've been talking with the President and parliament speakers, and also you're going to talk with the civil societies group, and then youth.  So my direct question to you is that:  Have you got any specific agreement with the Myanmar government or President Thein Sein about Myanmar reforms such as constitutional change, and peace negotiation, peace process, and also 2015 general election? And also to Daw Aung San Sui Kyi, you have got a one-hour discussion with the President, and at the current political situation, as you said, its a bumpy situation.  So if you didn't make amendment, or you didn't change constitution, the NLD and you, yourself, is going to be very difficult after 2015 elections.  So have you talked about those issues with the President?  Or the President talk to you about U.S. support for you?  Thank you. Barack Obama:  Well, the issue of making sure that reforms and the transition is fully realized was the main topic of our conversation and the main topic of my conversation with the President last night. As I indicated before, there are signs of progress.  We shouldn't deny that Burma today is not the same as Burma five years ago.  But the process is still incomplete.  And I was very specific with the President in terms of how we will measure whether or not the transition has been fully realized.  Number one, we expect elections to take place on time.  We do not want to see delays, because it's time for the voice of the people of Burma to be heard in a fair, free, transparent election. Number two, I indicated to the President that the constitution amendment process needs to reflect inclusion rather than exclusion, that there are certain provisions in the Burmese constitution that objectively don't make much sense.  Ultimately, what changes are made are up to the people of Burma.  But, for example, I don't understand a provision that would bar somebody from running for President because of who their children are.  That doesn't make much sense to me. Number three, we are very much in favor of the peace process, and I encourage the President to move forward in the negotiations.  He expressed some optimism about the ability to bring a deal to a conclusion.  But as Daw Suu has indicated, you have to be skeptical until it's actually done.  Number four, I indicated that we are paying attention to how religious minorities are treated in this country.  Now, I recognize the complexities of the situation in Rakhine state.  On the other hand, consistent with what Daw Suu just said, I am a firm believer that any legitimate government has to be based on rule of law and a recognition that all people are equal under the law.  And discrimination against the Rohingya or any other religious minority I think does not express the kind of country that Burma over the long term wants to be.  And I know of no successful democracy in which sectarian or religious divisions are allowed to fester, or the people of different faiths are treated as second-class citizens.  Ultimately, that is destabilizing to a democracy. And finally, I expressed to the President the need to continue to make additional progress on basic issues of freedom and personal security, that journalists can't be jailed simply because they were critical of the government; that arbitrary arrests or individuals being in some fashion abused by government with impunity rather than being respected and treated in accordance with law, that that's a test of whether or not a society is moving towards a genuine democratic process. And the President yesterday acknowledged that some progress has been made, and there was more to do.  And our position will be to continue to measure what's happening on the ground, to consult with a wide range of groups here in Burma.  We will strengthen our relationship where we see progress.  Where we dont see progress, then we will continue to express our concerns, and we will not be able to fully realize the kind of bilateral relationship that we want to have with Burma, the Burmese government, until weve seen some of these reforms completed. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi:  Well, you asked whether it's going to be fruitful for the NLD to win the elections if the amendments to the constitution are not pushed through.  I think its too early to ask this question.  Weve just spent one afternoon debating the question of constitutional amendment.  I think perhaps some of you may have heard that proportional representation is not going to be instituted. So when we started defending [inaudible] system against proportional representation, there were many who said to us, you are a very small minority in the legislature; how can you hope to win this case?  Its not a matter of wanting to win a case, its a matter of standing up for what you believe in, for what you believe is necessary for the future of our country. Now we are asking for a constitutional amendment not because were trying to win a case, but because we think that certain amendments are necessary if this country is to be a truly functioning democracy in line with the will of the people.  Because of that, we will persist in our efforts to have the constitution amended in the right way and within the framework of the law.  Ive always put great emphasis on this because I want peace and tranquility in our country.  I want our people to learn to live under the rule of law, and to support and uphold the importance of the rule of law.  So with regard to the constitution, we know that the people support our wish to amend it in certain ways, and we are prepared to negotiate with those who do not wish to amend the constitution.  I think thats what democracy is all about.  We need a culture of negotiated compromise as the foundation for our democratic union. So we would like to -- its not just a matter of debating the case in parliament and winning Brownie points or Boy Scout points, or whatever theyre called.  But its just a case of standing up for what we think our country needs.  And we would like to talk to those who disagree with us.  That, again, is what democracy is about.  You talk to those who disagree with you; you dont beat them down.  You exchange views.  And you come to a compromise, a settlement that would be best for the country. Ive always said that dialogues and debates are not aimed at achieving victory for one particular party or the other, but victory for our people as a whole.  Whatever we decide on should be seen as a victory for our nation, for the kind of democratic union that we have been trying to build up for decades. So please dont worry about whether or not we will win the elections in 2015.  Of course, any party wants to win the elections.  Im sure the President will tell you that.  But winning is not everything -- its how you win.  Id rather lose than win in the wrong way.  And that is the way I want our party and our people to approach the problems that we have to tackle -- that we want to win in the right way.  We want to bring the changes of the constitution about in the right way.  We want to build up a strong foundation for national reconciliation, which means reconciliation not just between the different ethnic groups and between different religious groups, but between different ideas -- for example, between the idea of military supremacy and the idea of civilian authority over the military, which is the foundation of democracy. So we want to exchange views and to come to an understanding with all those who at this moment do not yet agree with us.  And we are confident that we can come to such a settlement, come to such an agreement because, after all, I do believe that what all of us want is what is best for the country as a whole -- not just for particular individuals or groups or organizations.  So while I tell you that you need not worry about what affects amendment or non-amendment to the constitution might have on the elections, I might as well ask you to vote for us when we do get there. Barack Obama:  Pete Maer. Q:  Mr. President, it seems the stage is set for even more confrontations between you and Republicans when you get home, if thats possible.  Were told that youre soon going to sign the immigration reform executive order.  To what extent are you concerned about a Republican backlash from an action of that magnitude? And on two other issues, Im wondering what your take is on the plan to pass a bill to build the Keystone pipeline thats in the works now, before the State Departments review process is over.  And Senator McConnell is angry over the climate deal that you had made with China.  How does all of this square with your post-election assessment that people want to, as you put it, get stuff done? And if I may also pose a question to you, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.  Thank you for hosting all of us here from the White House media corps.  As the President mentioned of the constitutional barring of you running in your countrys election, what do you think the impact will be from the Presidents statement that was made here today on his strong opposition to that constitutional wording?  And what impact do you think it will have on the government here?  And is there anything more that youd like to see him do?  Thank you. Barack Obama:  Pete, the day after the election I said that there are going to be areas of agreement between me and Republicans, and there are going to be areas of disagreement.  There are going to be actions I take they dont like, and there are going to be bills they pass that I dont like. And I think, moving forward, thats exactly whats going to happen.  Youve mentioned areas where we disagree.  I believe that America is a nation of immigrants.  Everybody agrees that the system is broken.  There has been ample opportunity for Congress to pass a bipartisan immigration bill that would strengthen our borders, improve the legal immigration system, lift millions of people out of the shadows so they are paying taxes and getting right by the law.  It passed out of the Senate.  I gave the House over a year to go ahead and at least give a vote to the Senate bilaterally; they failed to do so.  And I indicated to Speaker Boehner several months ago that if, in fact, Congress failed to act, I would use all the lawful authority that I possess to try to make the system work better.  And thats going to happen.  Thats going to happen before the end of the year. But what Ive also said to them -- and I said this during the lunch with the Speaker and Leader McConnell -- is that I am always interested in negotiating a legislative solution to the immigration problem, and that the minute they pass a bill that I can sign that fixes our immigration system, then any executive actions I take are replaced. So they have the ability to fix the system.  What they dont have the ability to do is to expect me to stand by with a broken system in perpetuity.  And I would advise that if, in fact, they want to take a different approach, rather than devote a lot of time trying to constrain my lawful actions as the Chief Executive of the U.S. government in charge of our enforcing our immigration laws, that they spend some time passing a bill and engaging with all the stakeholders, the immigrant rights groups, the law enforcement groups, the evangelicals, the business community, all of whom have said this is something that needs to be done, is way overdue.  And weve been talking about it for 10 years now, and its been consistently stalled. So with respect to Keystone, Ive been clear in the past, Pete, my position hasnt changed, that this is a process that is supposed to be followed.  Right now you have a case pending in Nebraska, where the pipeline would run through, in which a state court judge has questioned the plan.  And until we know what the route is, its very hard to finish that evaluation.  And I dont think we should short-circuit that process. I have also noted that, as policy matter, my government believes that we should judge this pipeline based on whether or not it accelerates climate change or whether it helps the American people with their energy costs and their gas prices.  And I have to constantly push back against this idea that somehow the Keystone pipeline is either this massive jobs bill for the United States, or is somehow lowering gas prices. Understand what this project is.  It is providing the ability of Canada to pump their oil, send it through our land, down to the Gulf, where it will be sold everywhere else.  That doesn't have an impact on U.S. gas prices.  You know what does have an impact on U.S. gas prices is the incredible boom in U.S. oil production and natural gas production that's taken place under my administration.  And if my Republican friends really want to focus on what's good for the American people in terms of job creation and lower energy costs, we should be engaging in a conversation about what are we doing to produce even more homegrown energy.  I'm happy to have that conversation. With respect to the climate change deal, I have been very clear that I have responsibilities as President not just to current generations, but to future generations.  The science is indisputable.  The planet is getting warm, and it is getting warmer in part because of man-made activity.  And the release of carbon gases -- carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere can have a potentially devastating effect that will cost our country, could devastate communities, could increase the impact of natural disasters, and will have an impact worldwide that is destabilizing and could affect our national security.  That's not my opinion, by the way, that is the opinion of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, that climate change is a direct national security threat. Now the argument that I've received in the past has been either denial of the science or, alternatively, there's no point in us doing something about it despite us being one of the two largest emitters in the world, because if we do something and China doesn't do anything, we'll just put ourselves at a competitive disadvantage, we'll lose jobs to China, and the problem won't be solved anyway. I'm not going deny the science, but I took seriously the notion that we want all countries to participate in solving a global problem.  And so I engaged with China over a lengthy set of negotiations.  And by all independent accounts, for the first time, we got China to make a very serious commitment to constrain its greenhouse gases.  Why would anybody be against that?  That sounds like the right thing to do to me.  So that's a response to those specific ideas.  But let me reiterate what I said at the top.  The fact that I disagree or Republicans disagree with me on a certain set of issues doesn't exclude us working together on a whole range of issues where we do agree.  They're interested in tax reform -- so am I.  Let's get to work.  They're interested in promoting trade that will create jobs and opportunity for U.S. workers and U.S. businesses -- all over it.  It's part of what this Asia trip has been all about. They're interested in rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our ports, our airports, putting people back to work, making sure we're competitive -- I'm game.  So the one thing that I think is going to be important for us to have a successful partnership over the next couple of years is not making disagreements on a single issue suddenly a deal-breaker on every issue.  Democracy can never work that way because there are always going to be some differences.  And when there are differences you can't elevate those differences above the commonalities. I'm sorry that was a long answer, but it was a lot of questions. Do you want to -- Daw Aung San Suu Kyi: I'm sorry the President can't get away from all those. Barack Obama:  I know.  But before Daw Suu responds to the point about the constitutional amendment, I just want to emphasize, ultimately it's up to the people of Burma to make a decision about all these provisions. I expressed an objective view that some of current provisions don't seem to have much grounding in common sense or precedent when you look at other constitutions around the world, and seem more focused on advantaging or disadvantaging certain players.  And one of the basic concepts of a constitution is that it creates a level playing field for all people, and then so I use that as an example not because I think my voice is the one that's most relevant in terms of the constitutional amendment process, but ultimately it's up to the people of Burma. Q:  [Off-mic.] Barack Obama:  I did?  It doesn't make much sense to me. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi:  I believe democracy should stand up for that principle.  Barack Obama:  Absolutely. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi:  Well, I've always said that it's somewhat flattering to have a constitution written with me in mind.  But it shouldn't be done that way.  That's not how a democratic constitution should be written.  And we object to that clause not because -- not because it debars me from the presidency as such, but because it is against the principle of democracy and also unconstitutional.  The constitution says that all citizens should be treated as equals, and this is discrimination on the grounds of my children, my children's spouses, et cetera, et cetera.  Now, this is not acceptable.  And our people are firmly behind us in our desire to change this clause.  And if President Obama said anything about the necessity to change a clause like that, they will love him very much for it.  So he will be very popular among our people. And as he said, in the end, it is up to our people to shape the destiny of our country, including the way the constitution is going to be rewritten.  And I think the majority of our people understand that this constitution cannot stand as it is if we want to make the full transition to democracy; 59(f), as you know, debars anybody who is children of -- the spouses of the children belong to -- are citizens of another country. And according to the law -- and I think the President will know the law better than I do because I'm not a lawyer -- according to the law, anybody who is over the age of 18, or whatever legal adult age may be in his or her country, is responsible for himself or herself.  Nobody else is responsible for that person.  So from that point of view also, you cannot penalize anybody for what his or her adult children do.  From that point of view, it's illegal, it's against all norms of justice.  And from the point of view of democracy, it is not right to discriminate against one particular citizen.  You wouldn't like to be discriminated against, would you? So I think our people support the idea of amending this clause because -- not particularly because they want me to be president, perhaps because they do.  But I don't think it is so much because of that, but because they realize that this is unfair, unjust and undemocratic. Q:  Thank you.  I am [inaudible] from 11 Media from Myanmar. And I wanted to ask the question to Mr. President.  The question is, have you discussed about the [inaudible] situation in Myanmar [inaudible] president Thein Sein last night?  Because more journalists than politicians have been arrested, particularly in [inaudible], under the present Thein Sein administration. And when you discuss about this, how did he respond to this discussion?", "filename": "14November2014JointPressConferencewithDawAungSanSuuKyi.txt"}, {"question": "How do we permanently bring down costs and make quality, affordable health care available to every single American?", "filename": "15 June 2009\t American Medical Association Speech.txt"}, {"question": "Hello, Hyde Park! It is good to be home! It is good to be home! Everybody have a seat. You all relax. Its just me. You all know me. It is good to be back home. A couple of people I want to acknowledge -- first of all, I want to thank your Mayor, my great friend, Rahm Emanuel for his outstanding leadership of the city and his kind introduction.  I want to thank everybody here at Hyde Park Academy for welcoming me here today. I want to acknowledge your principal and your assistant principal -- although, they really make me feel old, because when I saw them -- where are they? Where are they? Stand up. Stand up.  They are doing outstanding work. Were very, very proud them. But you do make me feel old. Sit down. A couple other people I want to acknowledge -- Governor Pat Quinn is here doing great work down in Springfield.  My great friend and senior Senator Dick Durbin is in the house.  Congressman Bobby Rush is here.  Were in his district. Attorney General and former seatmate of mine when I was in the state senate, Lisa Madigan. County Board President -- used to be my alderwoman -- Tony Preckwinkle in the house. And Ive got -- I see a lot of reverend clergy here, but Im not going to mention them, because if I miss one Im in trouble.  Theyre all friends of mine. Theyve been knowing me. Some people may not know this, but obviously, this is my old neighborhood. I used to teach right around the corner. This is where Michelle and I met, where we fell in love -- Audience: Aww -- President Obama: This is where we raised our daughters, in a house just about a mile away from here -- less than a mile. And thats really what Ive come here to talk about today -- raising our kids. Audience: We love you! President Obama: I love you, too.  I love you, too. Im here to make sure that we talk about and then work towards giving every child every chance in life; building stronger communities and new ladders of opportunity that they can climb into the middle class and beyond; and, most importantly, keeping them safe from harm. Michelle was born and raised here -- a proud daughter of the South Side.  Last weekend, she came home, but it was to attend the funeral of Hadiya Pendleton. And Hadiyas parents, by the way, are here -- and I want to just acknowledge them. They are just wonderful, wonderful people. And as you know, this week, in my State of the Union, I talked about Hadiya on Tuesday night and the fact that unfortunately what happened to Hadiya is not unique. It's not unique to Chicago. It's not unique to this country. Too many of our children are being taken away from us. Two months ago, America mourned 26 innocent first-graders and their educators in Newtown. And today, I had the high honor of giving the highest civilian award I can give to the parent -- or the families of the educators who had been killed in Newtown. And there was something profound and uniquely heartbreaking and tragic, obviously, about a group of 6-year-olds being killed. But last year, there were 443 murders with a firearm on the streets of this city, and 65 of those victims were 18 and under. So thats the equivalent of a Newtown every four months. And thats precisely why the overwhelming majority of Americans are asking for some common-sense proposals to make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun. And as I said on Tuesday night, I recognize not everybody agrees with every issue. There are regional differences. The experience of gun ownership is different in urban areas than it is in rural areas, different from upstate and downstate Illinois. But these proposals deserve a vote in Congress. They deserve a vote.  They deserve a vote. And I want to thank those members of Congress who are working together in a serious way to try to address this issue. But Ive also said no law or set of laws can prevent every senseless act of violence in this country. When a child opens fire on another child, theres a hole in that childs heart that government can't fill -- only community and parents and teachers and clergy can fill that hole. In too many neighborhoods today -- whether here in Chicago or the farthest reaches of rural America -- it can feel like for a lot of young people the future only extends to the next street corner or the outskirts of town; that no matter how much you work or how hard you try, your destiny was determined the moment you were born. There are entire neighborhoods where young people, they dont see an example of somebody succeeding. And for a lot of young boys and young men, in particular, they dont see an example of fathers or grandfathers, uncles, who are in a position to support families and be held up and respected. And so that means that this is not just a gun issue. Its also an issue of the kinds of communities that were building. And for that, we all share a responsibility, as citizens, to fix it. We all share a responsibility to move this country closer to our founding vision that no matter who you are, or where you come from, here in America, you can decide your own destiny. You can succeed if you work hard and fulfill your responsibilities. Now, that means weve got to grow our economy and create more good jobs. It means weve got to equip every American with the skills and the training to fill those jobs. And it means weve got to rebuild ladders of opportunity for everybody willing to climb them. Now, that starts at home. Theres no more important ingredient for success, nothing that would be more important for us reducing violence than strong, stable families -- which means we should do more to promote marriage and encourage fatherhood.  Dont get me wrong -- as the son of a single mom, who gave everything she had to raise me with the help of my grandparents, I turned out okay.  But -- no, no, but I think its -- so weve got single moms out here, theyre heroic in what theyre doing and we are so proud of them.  But at the same time, I wish I had had a father who was around and involved. Loving, supportive parents -- and, by the way, thats all kinds of parents -- that includes foster parents, and that includes grandparents, and extended families; it includes gay or straight parents. Those parents supporting kids -- thats the single most important thing. Unconditional love for your child -- that makes a difference. If a child grows up with parents who have work, and have some education, and can be role models, and can teach integrity and responsibility, and discipline and delayed gratification -- all those things give a child the kind of foundation that allows them to say, my future, I can make it what I want. And weve got to make sure that every child has that, and in some cases, we may have to fill the gap and the void if children dont have that. So we should encourage marriage by removing the financial disincentives for couples who love one another but may find it financially disadvantageous if they get married. We should reform our child support laws to get more men working and engaged with their children.  And my Administration will continue to work with the faith community and the private sector this year on a campaign to encourage strong parenting and fatherhood. Because what makes you a man is not the ability to make a child, its the courage to raise one. We also know, though, that there is no surer path to success in the middle class than a good education. And what we now know is that that has to begin in the earliest years. Study after study shows that the earlier a child starts learning, the more likely they are to succeed -- the more likely they are to do well at Hyde Park Academy; the more likely they are to graduate; the more likely they are to get a good job; the more likely they are to form stable families and then be able to raise children themselves who get off to a good start. Chicago already has a competition, thanks to what the Mayor is doing, that rewards the best preschools in the city -- so Rahm has already prioritized this. But what Ive also done is say, lets give every child across America access to high-quality, public preschool. Every child, not just some.  Every dollar we put into early childhood education can save $7 down the road by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, reducing violent crime, reducing the welfare rolls, making sure that folks who have work, now theyre paying taxes. All this stuff pays back huge dividends if we make the investment. So lets make this happen. Lets make sure every child has the chance they deserve. As kids go through school, well recruit new math and science teachers to make sure that theyve got the skills that the future demands. Well help more young people in low-income neighborhoods get summer jobs. Well redesign our high schools and encourage our kids to stay in high school, so that the diploma they get leads directly to a good job once they graduate. Right here in Chicago, five new high schools have partnered with companies and community colleges to prepare our kids with the skills that businesses are looking for right now. And your College to Careers program helps community college students get access to the same kinds of real-world experiences. So we know what works. Lets just do it in more places. Lets reach more young people. Lets give more kids a chance. So we know how important families are. We know how important education is. We recognize that government alone cant solve these problems of violence and poverty, that everybody has to be involved. But we also have to remember that the broader economic environment of communities is critical as well. For example, we need to make sure that folks who are working now, often in the hardest jobs, see their work rewarded with wages that allow them to raise a family without falling into poverty. Today, a family with two kids that works hard and relies on a minimum wage salary still lives below the poverty line. Thats wrong, and we should fix it. We should reward an honest days work with honest wages. And that's why we should raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour and make it a wage you can live on. And even though some cities have bounced back pretty quickly from the recession, we know that there are communities and neighborhoods within cities or in small towns that havent bounced back. Cities like Chicago are ringed with former factory towns that never came back all the way from plants packing up; there are pockets of poverty where young adults are still looking for their first job. And thats why on Tuesday I announced -- and that's part of what I want to focus on here in Chicago and across the country -- is my intention to partner with 20 of the hardest-hit communities in America to get them back in the game -- get them back in the game. First, well work with local leaders to cut through red tape and improve things like public safety and education and housing. And well bring all the resources to bear in a coordinated fashion so that we can get that tipping point where suddenly a community starts feeling like things are changing and we can come back. Second of all, if youre willing to play a role in a childs education, then well help you reform your schools. We want to seed more and more partnerships of the kind that Rahm is trying to set up. Third, were going to help bring jobs and growth to hard-hit neighborhoods by giving tax breaks to business owners who invest and hire in those neighborhoods. Fourth, and specific to the issue of violence -- because its very hard to develop economically if people don't feel safe. If they don't feel like they can walk down the street and shop at a store without getting hit over head or worse, then commerce dries up, businesses don't want to locate, families move out, you get into the wrong cycle. So were going to target neighborhoods struggling to deal with violent crime and help them reduce that violence in ways that have been proven to work. And I know this is a priority of your Mayors; its going to be a priority of mine. And finally, were going to keep working in communities all across the country, including here in Chicago, to replace run-down public housing that doesnt offer much hope or safety with new, healthy homes for low- and moderate-income families. And here in Woodlawn, youve seen some of the progress that we can make when we come together to rebuild our neighborhoods, and attract new businesses, and improve our schools. Woodlawn is not all the way where it needs to be, but thanks to wonderful institutions like Apostolic Church, weve made great progress. So we want to help more communities follow your example. And lets go even farther by offering incentives to companies that hire unemployed Americans who have got what it takes to fill a job opening, but they may have been out of work so long that nobody is willing to give them a chance right now. Lets put our people back to work rebuilding vacant homes in need of repair. Young people can get experience -- apprenticeships, learn a trade. And were removing blight from our community. If we gather together what works, we can extend more ladders of opportunity for anybody whos working to build a strong, middle-class life for themselves. Because in America, your destiny shouldnt be determined by where you live, where you were born. It should be determined by how big youre willing to dream, how much effort and sweat and tears youre willing to put in to realizing that dream. When I first moved to Chicago -- before any of the students in this room were born -- and a whole lot of people who are in the audience remember me from those days, I lived in a community on the South Side right up the block, but I also worked further south where communities had been devastated by some of the steel plants closing. And my job was to work with churches and laypeople and local leaders to rebuild neighborhoods, and improve schools, and help young people who felt like they had nowhere to turn. And those of you who worked with me, Reverend Love, you remember, it wasnt easy. Progress didnt come quickly. Sometimes I got so discouraged I thought about just giving up. But what kept me going was the belief that with enough determination and effort and persistence and perseverance, change is always possible; that we may not be able to help everybody, but if we help a few then that propels progress forward. We may not be able to save every child from gun violence, but if we save a few, that starts changing the atmosphere in our communities.  We may not be able to get everybody a job right away, but if we get a few folks a job, then everybody starts feeling a little more hopeful and a little more encouraged.  Neighborhood by neighborhood, one block by one block, one family at a time. Now, this is what I had a chance to talk about when I met with some young men from Hyde Park Academy who were participating in this B.A.M. program. Where are the guys I talked to?", "filename": "15February2013OnStrengtheningtheEconomyfortheMiddleClass.txt"}, {"question": "I want to, first of all, thank Ambassador Gildenhorn for the outstanding work he does as board chairman here at the Woodrow Wilson Center, and to my great friend Lee Hamilton, who is, I think, an example of what's best in American public service, and has done so much to not only promote American interests all across the globe but also to educate the American people on our foreign policy. So, thank you very much. Sixty-one years ago, George Marshal announced the plan that would come to bear his name. Much of Europe lay in ruins. The United States faced a powerful and ideological enemy intent on world domination. This menace was magnified by the recently discovered capability to destroy life on an unimaginable scale. The Soviet Union didn't yet have an atomic bomb, but before long it would. The challenge facing the greatest generation of Americans -- the generation that had vanquished fascism on the battlefield -- was how to contain this threat while extending freedom's frontiers. Leaders like Truman and Acheson, Kennan and Marshall, knew that there was no single decisive blow that could be struck for freedom. We needed a new overarching strategy to meet the challenges of a new and dangerous world. Such a strategy would join overwhelming military strength with sound judgment. It would shape events not just through military force, but through the force of our ideas; through economic power, intelligence and diplomacy. It would support strong allies that freely shared our ideals of liberty and democracy; open markets and the rule of law. It would foster new international institutions like the United Nations, NATO, and the World Bank, and focus on every corner of the globe. It was a strategy that saw clearly the world's dangers, while seizing its promise. As a general, Marshall had spent years helping FDR wage war. But the Marshall Plan -- which was just one part of this strategy -- helped rebuild not just allies, but also the nation that Marshall had plotted to defeat. In the speech announcing his plan, he concluded not with tough talk or definitive declarations -- but rather with questions and a call for perspective. \"The whole world of the future,\" Marshall said, \"hangs on a proper judgment.\" To make that judgment, he asked the American people to examine distant events that directly affected their security and prosperity. He closed by asking: \"What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done?\" What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done? Today's dangers are different, though no less grave. The power to destroy life on a catastrophic scale now risks falling into the hands of terrorists. The future of our security -- and our planet -- is held hostage to our dependence on foreign oil and gas. From the cave- spotted mountains of northwest Pakistan, to the centrifuges spinning beneath Iranian soil, we know that the American people cannot be protected by oceans or the sheer might of our military alone. The attacks of September 11 brought this new reality into a terrible and ominous focus. On that bright and beautiful day, the world of peace and prosperity that was the legacy of our Cold War victory seemed to suddenly vanish under rubble, and twisted steel, and clouds of smoke. But the depth of this tragedy also drew out the decency and determination of our nation. At blood banks and vigils; in schools and in the United States Congress, Americans were united -- more united, even, than we were at the dawn of the Cold War. The world, too, was united against the perpetrators of this evil act, as old allies, new friends, and even long-time adversaries stood by our side. It was time -- once again -- for America's might and moral suasion to be harnessed; it was time to once again shape a new security strategy for an ever-changing world. Imagine, for a moment, what we could have done in those days, and months, and years after 9/11. We could have deployed the full force of American power to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden, Al Qaida, the Taliban, and all of the terrorists responsible for 9/11, while supporting real security in Afghanistan. We could have secured loose nuclear materials around the world, and updated a 20th century non-proliferation framework to meet the challenges of the 21st. We could have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in alternative sources of energy to grow our economy, save our planet, and end the tyranny of oil. We could have strengthened old alliances, formed new partnerships, and renewed international institutions to advance peace and prosperity. We could have called on a new generation to step into the strong currents of history, and to serve their country as troops and teachers, Peace Corps volunteers and police officers. We could have secured our homeland -- investing in sophisticated new protection for our ports, our trains and our power plants. We could have rebuilt our roads and bridges, laid down new rail and broadband and electricity systems, and made college affordable for every American to strengthen our ability to compete. We could have done that. Instead, we have lost thousands of American lives, spent nearly a trillion dollars, alienated allies and neglected emerging threats -- all in the cause of fighting a war for well over five years in a country that had absolutely nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks. Our men and women in uniform have accomplished every mission we have given them. What's missing in our debate about Iraq -- what has been missing since before the war began -- is a discussion of the strategic consequences of Iraq and its dominance of our foreign policy. This war distracts us from every threat that we face and so many opportunities we could seize. This war diminishes our security, our standing in the world, our military, our economy, and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century. By any measure, our single-minded and open-ended focus on Iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping America safe. I am running for President of the United States to lead this country in a new direction -- to seize this moment's promise. Instead of being distracted from the most pressing threats that we face, I want to overcome them. Instead of pushing the entire burden of our foreign policy on to the brave men and women of our military, I want to use all elements of American power to keep us safe, and prosperous, and free. Instead of alienating ourselves from the world, I want America -- once again -- to lead. As President, I will pursue a tough, smart and principled national security strategy -- one that recognizes that we have interests not just in Baghdad, but in Kandahar and Karachi, in Tokyo and London, in Beijing and Berlin. I will focus this strategy on five goals essential to making America safer: ending the war in Iraq responsibly; finishing the fight against Al Qaida and the Taliban; securing all nuclear weapons and materials from terrorists and rogue states; achieving true energy security; and rebuilding our alliances to meet the challenges of the 21st century. My opponent in this campaign has served this country with honor, and we all respect his sacrifice. We both want to do what we think is best to defend the American people. But we've made different judgments, and would lead in very different directions. That starts with Iraq. I opposed going to war in Iraq; Senator McCain was one of Washington's biggest supporters for war. I warned that the invasion of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of extremism, and distract us from the fight against Al Qaida and the Taliban; Senator McCain claimed that we would be greeted as liberators, and that democracy would spread across the Middle East. Those were the judgments we made on the most important strategic question since the end of the Cold War. Now, all of us recognize that we must do more than look back -- we must make a judgment about how to move forward. What is needed? What can best be done? What must be done?", "filename": "15July2008PolicySpeechonIraqattheWoodrowWilsonCenter.txt"}, {"question": "Good afternoon, everybody.  Yesterday was a historic day.  The comprehensive, long-term deal that we achieved with our allies and partners to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon represents a powerful display of American leadership and diplomacy.  It shows what we can accomplish when we lead from a position of strength and a position of principle, when we unite the international community around a shared vision, and we resolve to solve problems peacefully. As I said yesterday, its important for the American people and Congress to get a full opportunity to review this deal.  That process is now underway.  Ive already reached out to leaders in Congress on both sides of the aisle.  My national security team has begun offering extensive briefings.  I expect the debate to be robust -- and thats how it should be.  This is an important issue.  Our national security policies are stronger and more effective when they are subject to the scrutiny and transparency that democracy demands. And as I said yesterday, the details of this deal matter very much.  Thats why our team worked so hard for so long to get the details right.  At the same time, as this debate unfolds, I hope we dont lose sight of the larger picture -- the opportunity that this agreement represents.  As we go forward, its important for everybody to remember the alternative and the fundamental choice that this moment represents.  With this deal, we cut off every single one of Irans pathways to a nuclear program -- a nuclear weapons program, and Irans nuclear program will be under severe limits for many years.  Without a deal, those pathways remain open; there would be no limits on Irans nuclear program, and Iran could move closer to a nuclear bomb. With this deal, we gain unprecedented, around-the-clock monitoring of Irans key nuclear facilities and the most comprehensive and intrusive inspection and verification regime ever negotiated.  Without a deal, those inspections go away, and we lose the ability to closely monitor Irans program and detect any covert nuclear weapons program. With this deal, if Iran violates its commitments, there will be real consequences.  Nuclear-related sanctions that have helped to cripple the Iranian economy will snap back into place.  Without a deal, the international sanctions regime will unravel, with little ability to re-impose them.  With this deal, we have the possibility of peacefully resolving a major threat to regional and international security.  Without a deal, we risk even more war in the Middle East, and other countries in the region would feel compelled to pursue their own nuclear programs, threatening a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world. As I said yesterday, even with this deal, we will continue to have profound differences with Iran -- its support for terrorism and its use of proxies to destabilize parts of the Middle East.  Therefore, the multilateral arms embargo on Iran will remain in place for an additional five years, and restrictions on ballistic missile technology will remain for eight years.  In addition, the United States will maintain our own sanctions related to Irans support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, and its human rights violations.  And well continue our unprecedented security cooperation with Israel and continue to deepen our partnerships with the Gulf States.  But the bottom line is this:  This nuclear deal meets the national security interests of the United States and our allies.  It prevents the most serious threat -- Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon, which would only make the other problems that Iran may cause even worse.  Thats why this deal makes our country, and the world, safer and more secure.  Its why the alternative -- no limits on Irans nuclear program, no inspections, an Iran thats closer to a nuclear weapon, the risk of a regional nuclear arms race and a greater risk of war -- all that would endanger our security.  Thats the choice that we face.  If we dont choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly for letting this moment slip away.    And no one suggests that this deal resolves all the threats that Iran poses to its neighbors or the world.  Moreover, realizing the promise of this deal will require many years of implementation and hard work.  It will require vigilance and execution.  But this deal is our best means of assuring that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.  And, from the start, that has been my number-one priority, our number-one priority.  Weve got a historic chance to pursue a safer and more secure world -- an opportunity that may not come again in our lifetimes.  As President and as Commander-in-Chief, I am determined to seize that opportunity.  So with that, Im going to take some questions.  And let me see who Im starting off with.  Here you go.  I got it.    Andrew Beatty, AFP. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Yesterday, you said the deal offered a chance at a new direction in relations with Iran.  What steps will you take to enable a more moderate Iran?  And does this deal allow you to more forcefully counter Irans destabilizing actions in the region quite aside from the nuclear question?  Thank you. President Obama:  Andrew, if you dont mind, just because I suspect that theres going to be a common set of questions that are touched on -- I promise I will get to your question, but I want to start off just by stepping back and reminding folks of what is at stake here.  And I already did in my opening statement, but I just want to reiterate it because Ive heard already some of the objections to the deal. The starting premise of our strategy with respect to Iran has been that it would be a grave threat to the United States and to our allies if they obtained a nuclear weapon.  And so everything that weve done over the last six and a half years has been designed to make sure that we address that number-one priority.  Thats what the sanctions regime was all about.  Thats how we were able to mobilize the international community, including some folks that we are not particularly close to, to abide by these sanctions.  Thats how these crippling sanctions came about, was because we were able to gain global consensus that Iran having a nuclear weapon would be a problem for everybody. Thats the reason that Irans accounts got frozen and they were not able to get money for the oil sales that theyve made.  Thats the reason that they had problems operating with respect to international commerce -- because we built that international consensus around this very specific, narrow, but profound issue -- the possibility of Iran getting a nuclear weapon. And, by the way, that was not simply my priority.  If you look back at all the debates that have taken place over the last five, six years, this has been a Democratic priority, this has been a Republican priority, this has been Prime Minister Netanyahus priority.  Its been our Gulf allies priority -- is making sure Iran does not get a nuclear weapon. The deal negotiated by John Kerry, Wendy Sherman, Ernie Moniz, our allies, our partners, the P5+1 achieves that goal.  It achieves our top priority -- making sure that Iran does not get a nuclear weapon.  But we have always recognized that even if Iran doesnt get a nuclear weapon, Iran still poses challenges to our interests and our values, both in the region and around the world.  So when this deal gets implemented, we know that we will have dismantled the immediate concerns around Irans nuclear program.  We will have brought their stockpiles down to 98 percent.  We will have significantly reduced the number of centrifuges that they operate.  We will have installed an unprecedented inspections regime, and that will remain in place not just for 10 years but, for example, on the stockpiles, will continue to 15 years.  Iran will have pledged to the international community that it will not develop a nuclear weapon and now will be subject to an Additional Protocol, a more vigorous inspection and monitoring regime that lasts in perpetuity.  We will have disabled a facility like Arak, the Arak facility, from allowing Iran to develop plutonium that could be used for a bomb.  We will have greatly reduced the stockpile of uranium thats enriched.  And we will have put in place inspections along the entire supply chain so that if uranium was diverted into a covert program we would catch it. So I can say with confidence but, more importantly, nuclear experts can say with confidence that Iran will not be in a position to develop a nuclear bomb.  We will have met our number-one priority.  Now, well still have problems with Irans sponsorship of terrorism; its funding of proxies like Hezbollah that threaten Israel and threaten the region; the destabilizing activities that they're engaging in, including in places like Yemen.  And my hope is that building on this deal we can continue to have conversations with Iran that incentivize them to behave differently in the region, to be less aggressive, less hostile, more cooperative, to operate the way we expect nations in the international community to behave.  But we're not counting on it.  So this deal is not contingent on Iran changing its behavior.  Its not contingent on Iran suddenly operating like a liberal democracy. It solves one particular problem, which is making sure they don't have a bomb.  And the point Ive repeatedly made -- and is, I believe, hard to dispute -- is that it will be a lot easier for us to check Irans nefarious activities, to push back against the other areas where they operate contrary to our interests or our allies interests, if they don't have a bomb. And so will they change their behavior?  Will we seek to gain more cooperation from them in resolving issues like Syria, or whats happening in Iraq, to stop encouraging Houthis in Yemen?  Well continue to engage with them.  Although, keep in mind that unlike the Cuba situation, we're not normalizing diplomatic relations here.  So the contacts will continue to be limited.  But will we try to encourage them to take a more constructive path?  Of course.  But we're not betting on it.  And in fact, having resolved the nuclear issue, we will be in a stronger position to work with Israel, work with the Gulf countries, work with our other partners, work with the Europeans to bring additional pressure to bear on Iran around those issues that remain of concern. But the argument that Ive been already hearing -- and this was foreshadowed even before the deal was announced -- that because this deal does not solve all those other problems, that that's an argument for rejecting this deal, defies logic.  It makes no sense.  And it loses sight of what was our original number-one priority, which is making sure that they don't have a bomb. Jon Karl. Question:  Mr. President, does it give you any pause to see this deal praised by Syrian dictator Assad as a great victory for Iran, or praised by those in Tehran who still shout death to America, and yet our closest ally in the Middle East calls it a mistake of historic proportions?  And here in Congress, it looks like a large majority will vote to reject this deal.  I know you can veto that rejection, but do you have any concerns about seeing a majority of the peoples representatives in Congress saying that this is a bad deal?  And if I can just ask you quick political question, a very quick one. President Obama:  Jon, I think -- Question:  Donald -- President Obama:  Let me answer the question that you asked.  It does not give me pause that Mr. Assad or others in Tehran may be trying to spin the deal in a way that they think is favorable to what their constituencies want to hear.  Thats what politicians do.  And thats been the case throughout.  I mean, youll recall that during the course of these negotiations over the last couple of months every time the Supreme Leader or somebody tweeted something out, for some reason we all bought into the notion, well, the Obama administration must be giving this or capitulating to that.  Well, now we have a document so you can see what the deal is. We dont have to speculate, we dont have to engage in spin, you can just read what it says and what is required.  And nobody has disputed that as a consequence of this agreement Iran has to drastically reduce its stockpiles of uranium, is cut off from plutonium; the Fordow facility that is underground is converted; that we have an unprecedented inspections regime; that we have snap-back provisions if they cheat.  The facts are the facts.  And I'm not concerned about what others say about it.  Now, with respect to Congress, my hope -- I wont prejudge this -- my hope is, is that everyone in Congress also evaluates this agreement based on the facts -- not on politics, not on posturing, not on the fact that this is a deal I bring to Congress as opposed to a Republican President, not based on lobbying, but based on whats in the national interest of the United States of America.  And I think that if Congress does that, then, in fact, based on the facts, the majority of Congress should approve of this deal.  But we live in Washington and politics do intrude.  And as I said in an interview yesterday, I am not betting on the Republican Party rallying behind this agreement.  I do expect the debate to be based on facts and not speculation or misinformation.  And that I welcome -- in part because, look, there are legitimate real concerns here.  Weve already talked about it.  We have huge differences with Iran.  Israel has legitimate concerns about its security relative to Iran.  You have a large country with a significant military that has proclaimed that Israel shouldnt exist, that has denied the Holocaust, that has financed Hezbollah, and as a consequence there are missiles that are pointed towards Tel Aviv.  And so I think there are very good reasons why Israelis are nervous about Irans position in the world generally.  And Ive said this to Prime Minister Netanyahu, Ive said it directly to the Israeli people.  But what Ive also said is that all those threats are compounded if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.  And for all the objections of Prime Minister Netanyahu, or, for that matter, some of the Republican leadership thats already spoken, none of them have presented to me, or the American people, a better alternative.  I'm hearing a lot of talking points being repeated about this is a bad deal -- this is a historically bad deal, this will threaten Israel and threaten the world and threaten the United States.  I mean, theres been a lot of that.  What I havent heard is, what is your preferred alternative?  If 99 percent of the world community and the majority of nuclear experts look at this thing and they say, this will prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb, and you are arguing either that it does not, or that even if it does its temporary, or that because theyre going to get a windfall of their accounts being unfrozen that theyll cause more problems, then you should have some alternative to present.  And I havent heard that.  And the reason is because there really are only two alternatives here:  Either the issue of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon is resolved diplomatically through a negotiation, or its resolved through force, through war.  Those are the options. Now, youll hear some critics say, well, we could have negotiated a better deal.  Okay.  What does that mean?  I think the suggestion among a lot of the critics has been that a better deal, an acceptable deal would be one in which Iran has no nuclear capacity at all, peaceful or otherwise.  The problem with that position is that there is nobody who thinks that Iran would or could ever accept that, and the international community does not take the view that Iran cant have a peaceful nuclear program.  They agree with us that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. And so we dont have diplomatic leverage to eliminate every vestige of a peaceful nuclear program in Iran.  What we do have the leverage to do is to make sure they dont have a weapon.  Thats exactly what weve done. So to go back to Congress, I challenge those who are objecting to this agreement, number one, to read the agreement before they comment on it; number two, to explain specifically where it is that they think this agreement does not prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and why theyre right and people like Ernie Moniz, who is an MIT nuclear physicist and an expert in these issues, is wrong, why the rest of the world is wrong, and then present an alternative. And if the alternative is that we should bring Iran to heel through military force, then those critics should say so.  And that will be an honest debate.  All right. Question:  Mr. President, if I can -- President Obama:  No, no -- Question:  Prime Minister Netanyahu said that you have a situation where Iran can delay 24 days before giving access to military facilities -- President Obama:  Im happy to -- thats a good example.  So lets take the issue of 24 days.  This has been I think swirling today, the notion that this is insufficient in terms of inspections. Now, keep in mind, first of all, that well have 24/7 inspections of declared nuclear facilities -- Fordow, Natanz, Arak, their uranium mines; facilities that are known to produce centrifuges, parts.  That entire infrastructure that we know about we will have sophisticated, 24/7 monitoring of those facilities.  So then the issue is, what if they try to develop a covert program?  Now, one of the advantages of having inspections across the entire production chain is that it makes it very difficult to set up a covert program.  There are only so many uranium mines in Iran.  And if, in fact, were counting the amount of uranium thats being mined and suddenly some is missing on the back end, they got some explaining to do. So were able to track whats happening along the existing facilities to make sure that there is not diversion into a covert program.  But lets say that Iran is so determined that it now wants to operate covertly.  The IAEA, the international organization charged with implementing the non-proliferation treaty and monitoring nuclear activities in countries around the world -- the IAEA will have the ability to say, that undeclared site were concerned about, we see something suspicious.  And they will be able to say to Iran, we want to go inspect that.  Now, if Iran objects, we can override it.  In the agreement, weve set it up so we can override Irans objection.  And we dont need Russia or China in order for us to get that override.  And if they continue to object, were in a position to snap back sanctions and declare that Iran is in violation and is cheating.  As for the fact that it may take 24 days to finally get access to the site, the nature of nuclear programs and facilities is such, this is not something you hide in a closet.  This is not something you put on a dolly and kind of wheel off somewhere.  And, by the way, if we identify an undeclared site that were suspicious about, were going to be keeping eyes on it.  So were going to be monitoring what the activity is, and thats going to be something that will be evidence if we think that some funny business was going on there that we can then present to the international community. So well be monitoring that that entire time.  And, by the way, if there is nuclear material on that site, high school physics will remind us that that leaves a trace.  And so well know that, in fact, there was a violation of the agreement.  So the point is, Jonathan, that this is the most vigorous inspection and verification regime by far that has ever been negotiated.  Is it possible that Iran decides to try to cheat despite having this entire inspection verification mechanism?  Its possible.  But if it does, first of all, weve built in a one-year breakout time, which gives us a year to respond forcefully.  And weve built in a snap-back provision so we don't have to go through lengthy negotiations at the U.N. to put the sanctions right back in place.  And so really the only argument you can make against the verification and inspection mechanism that weve put forward is that Iran is so intent on obtaining a nuclear weapon that no inspection regime and no verification mechanism would be sufficient because theyd find some way to get around it because they're untrustworthy. And if that's your view, then we go back to the choice that you have to make earlier.  That means, presumably, that you can't negotiate.  And what you're really saying is, is that you've got to apply military force to guarantee that they don't have a nuclear program.  And if somebody wants to make that debate -- whether its the Republican leadership, or Prime Minister Netanyahu, or the Israeli Ambassador or others, they're free to make it.  But its not persuasive. Carol Lee. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to ask you about the arms and ballistic missile embargo.  Why did you decide -- agree to lift those even with the five- and eight-year durations?  Its obviously emerging as a sticking point on the Hill.  And are you concerned that arms to Iran will go to Hezbollah or Hamas?  And is there anything that you or a future President can do to stop that? And if you don't mind, I wanted to see if you could step back a little bit, and when you look at this Iran deal and all the other issues and unrest that's happening in the Middle East, what kind of Middle East do you want to leave when you leave the White House in a year and a half? President Obama:  So the issue of the arms embargo and ballistic missiles is of real concern to us -- has been of real concern to us.  And it is in the national security interest of the United States to prevent Iran from sending weapons to Hezbollah, for example, or sending weapons to the Houthis in Yemen that accelerate a civil war there.  We have a number of mechanisms under international law that give us authority to interdict arms shipments by Iran.  One of those mechanisms is the U.N. security resolution related to Irans nuclear program.  Essentially, Iran was sanctioned because of what had happened at Fordow, its unwillingness to comply with previous U.N. security resolutions about their nuclear program.  And as part of the package of sanctions that was slapped on them, the issue of arms and ballistic missiles were included. Now, under the terms of the original U.N. resolution, the fact is that once an agreement was arrived at that gave the international community assurance Iran didn't have a nuclear weapon, you could argue just looking at the text that those arms and ballistic missile prohibitions should immediately go away.  But what I said to our negotiators was given that Iran has breached trust, and the uncertainty of our allies in the region about Irans activities, lets press for a longer extension of the arms embargo and the ballistic missile prohibitions.  And we got that.  We got five years in which, under this new agreement, arms coming in and out of Iran are prohibited.  And we got eight years with respect to ballistic missiles.  But part of the reason why we were willing to extend it only for five, lets say, as opposed to a longer period of time, is because we have other U.N. resolutions that prohibit arms sales by Iran to organizations like Hezbollah.  We have other U.N. resolutions and multilateral agreements that give us authority to interdict arms shipments from Iran throughout the region.  And so weve had belts and suspenders and buttons, a whole bunch of different legal authorities.  These legal authorities under the nuclear program may lapse after five or eight years, but well still be in possession of other legal authorities that allow us to interdict those arms. And truthfully, these prohibitions are not self-enforcing.  Its not like the U.N. has the capacity to police what Iran is doing.  What it does is it gives us authority under international law to prevent arms shipments from happening in concert with our allies and our partners.  And the real problem, if you look at how, for example, Hezbollah got a lot of missiles that are a grave threat to Israel and many of our friends in the region, its not because they were legal.  Its not because somehow that was authorized under international law.  It was because there was insufficient intelligence, or capacity, to stop those shipments. So the bottom line is, Carol, I share the concerns of Israel, Saudis, Gulf partners about Iran shipping arms and causing conflict and chaos in the region.  And thats why Ive said to them, lets double down and partner much more effectively to improve our intelligence capacity and our interdiction capacity so that fewer of those arms shipments are getting through the net. But the legal authorities, well still possess.  And obviously, weve got our own unilateral prohibitions and sanctions in place around non-nuclear issues, like support for Hezbollah.  And those remain in place. Now, in terms of the larger issues of the Middle East, obviously thats a longer discussion.  I think my key goal when I turn over the keys to the President -- the next President -- is that we are on track to defeat ISIL; that they are much more contained and were moving in the right direction there.  That we have jumpstarted a process to resolve the civil war in Syria, which is like an open sore in the region and is giving refuge to terrorist organizations who are taking advantage of that chaos.  To make sure that in Iraq not only have we pushed back ISIL, but weve also created an environment in which Sunni, Shia and Kurd are starting to operate and function more effectively together.  And to be in a conversation with all our partners in the region about how we have strengthened our security partnerships so that they feel they can address any potential threats that may come, including threats from Iran.  And that includes providing additional security assurances and cooperation to Israel, building on the unprecedented cooperation that we have already put in place and support that weve already put in place.  It includes the work that weve done with the GCC up at Camp David, making sure that we execute that. If weve done those things, then the problems in the Middle East will not be solved.  And ultimately, its not the job of the President of the United States to solve every problem in the Middle East.  The people of the Middle East are going to have to solve some of these problems themselves.  But I think we can provide that next President at least a foundation for continued progress in these various areas. The last thing I would say -- and this is a longer-term issue -- is we have to address the youth in the region with jobs and opportunity and a better vision for the future so that they are not tempted by the nihilistic, violent dead-end that organizations like ISIL offer.  Again, we cant do that entirely by ourselves, but we can partner with well-intentioned organizations, states, NGOs, religious leaders in the region.  We have to do a better job of that than weve been doing so far. Michael Crowley. Question:   Thank you.  You alluded earlier to Irans role in Syria, just to focus on that for a moment.  Many analysts and some former members of your administration believe that the kind of negotiated political settlement that you say is necessary in Syria will require working directly with Iran and giving Iran an important role.  Do you agree?  And is that a dialogue youll be actively seeking?  And what about the fight against ISIS?  What would it take for there to be explicit cooperation between the U.S. and Iran? President Obama:  I do agree that were not going to solve the problems in Syria unless theres buy-in from the Russians, the Iranians, the Turks, our Gulf partners.  Its too chaotic.  There are too many factions.  Theres too much money and too many arms flooding into the zone.  Its gotten caught up in both sectarian conflict and geopolitical jockeying.  And in order for us to resolve it, theres going to have to be agreement among the major powers that are interested in Syria that this is not going to be won on the battlefield.  So Iran is one of those players, and I think that its important for them to be part of that conversation.  I want to repeat what I said earlier.  We have not -- and I dont anticipate any time in the near future -- restored normal diplomatic relations with Iran.  And so I do not foresee a formal set of agreements with Iran in terms of how were conducting our counter-ISIL campaign.  But clearly, Iran has influence in Iraq.  Iraq has a majority Shia population.  They have relationships to Iran.  Some are natural.  We expect somebody like Prime Minister Abadi to meet with and negotiate and work with Iran as its neighbor.  Some are less legitimate, where you see Iran financing Shia militias that in the past have killed American soldiers and in the future may carry out atrocities when they move into Sunni areas.  And so were working with our diplomats on the ground, as well as our military teams on the ground to asses where can we appropriately at least de-conflict, and where can we work with Prime Minister Abadi around an overall strategy for Iraq to regain its sovereignty, and where do we tell Abadi, you know what, what Iran is doing there is a problem, and we cant cooperate in that area, for example, unless you get those folks out of there because were not going to have our troops, even in an advisory or training role, looking over their shoulders because theyre not sure of what might happen to them.  And those conversations have been ongoing.  I think they will continue.  The one thing you can count on is that any work that the U.S. government does, or the U.S. military does in Iraq with other partners on the ground is premised on the idea that they are reporting to -- under the chain of command of the Iraqi government and Iraqi security forces.  If we dont have confidence that ultimately Abadi is directing those soldiers, then its tough for us to have any kind of direct relationship. Major Garrett. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  As you well know, there are four Americans in Iran -- three held on trumped-up charges, according to your administration; one, whereabouts unknown.  Can you tell the country, sir, why you are content, with all the fanfare around this deal, to leave the conscience of this nation and the strength of this nation unaccounted for in relation to these four Americans? And last week, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said, under no circumstances should there be any relief for Iran in terms of ballistic missiles or conventional weapons.  It is perceived that that was a last-minute capitulation in these negotiations.  Many in the Pentagon feel youve left the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff hung out to dry.  Could you comment? President Obama:  I got to give you credit, Major, for how you craft those questions.  The notion that I am content as I celebrate with American citizens languishing in Iranian jails -- Major, thats nonsense, and you should know better. Ive met with the families of some of those folks.  Nobody is content.  And our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out.  Now, if the question is why we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that that creates.  Suddenly, Iran realizes, you know what, maybe we can get additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals.  It makes it much more difficult for us to walk away if Iran somehow thinks that a nuclear deal is dependent in some fashion on the nuclear deal.  And, by the way, if we had walked away from the nuclear deal, wed still be pushing them just as hard to get these folks out.  Thats why those issues are not connected.  But we are working every single day to try to get them out, and wont stop until theyre out and rejoined with their families. With respect to the Chairmans testimony, to some degree I already answered this with Carol.  We are not taking the pressure off Iran with respect to arms and with respect to ballistic missiles.  As I just explained, not only do we keep in place for five years the arms embargo under this particular new U.N. resolution, not only do we maintain the eight years on the ballistic missiles under this particular U.N. resolution, but we have a host of other multilateral and unilateral authorities that allow us to take action where we see Iran engaged in those activities whether its six years from now or 10 years from now. So we have not lost those legal authorities.  And in fact, part of my pitch to the GCC countries, as well as to Prime Minister Netanyahu, is we should do a better job making sure that Iran is not engaged in sending arms to organizations like Hezbollah.  And as I just indicated, that means improving our intelligence capacity and our interdiction capacity with our partners. April Ryan. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to change the subject a bit.  Earlier this year, on the flight to Selma, you said, on matters of race, as President your job is to close the remaining gaps that are left in state and federal government.  Now, how does criminal justice reform fit into that equation?  And what gaps remain for you towards the end of your presidency?  And also, what does it mean to travel to Kenya, your fathers homeland, in the next couple of weeks as President to the United States?  And lastly, would you revoke the Medal of Freedom from Bill Cosby? President Obama:  You stuffed a lot in there, April.  Question:  I learned from my colleagues.  President Obama:  Say, who did you learn from?  Jonathan Karl?  Is that what you said? Question:   On criminal justice reform, obviously I gave a lengthy speech yesterday, but this is something that Ive been thinking about a lot; been working first with Eric Holder, now with Loretta Lynch about -- weve been working on along with other prosecutors of the U.S. Attorneys Office.  Its an outgrowth of the task force that we put together, post-Ferguson and the Garner case in New York. And I dont think that the criminal justice system is obviously the sole source of racial tension in this country, or the key institution to resolving the opportunity gap.  But I think it is a part of the broader set of challenges that we face in creating a more perfect union.  And the good news is, is that this is one of those rare issues where weve got some Republican and Democratic interest, as well as federal, state, and local interest in solving the problem.  I think people recognize that there are violent criminals out there and theyve got to be locked up.  Weve got to have tough prosecutors, we have to support our law enforcement officials.  Police are in a tough job and they are helping to keep us safe, and we are grateful and thankful to them. But what we also know is this huge spike in incarcerations is also driven by non-violent drug offenses where the sentencing is completely out of proportion with the crime.  And that costs taxpayers enormous amounts of money.  It is debilitating communities who are seeing huge proportions of the young men in their communities finding themselves with a criminal record, rendering them oftentimes unemployable.  So it compounds problems that these communities already have.  And so I am very appreciative of folks like Dick Durbin and Cory Booker, alongside Mike Lee and Rand Paul and other folks in the House who are working together to see if we can both reduce some of these mandatory minimums around non-violent drug offenses.  Because again, I tend not to have a lot of sympathy when it comes to violent crime.  But when it comes to non-violent drug offenses, is there work that we can do to reduce mandatory minimums, create more diversion programs like drug courts?  Then, can we do a better job on the rehabilitation side inside of prisons so that we are preparing these folks who are eventually going to be released to reenter the workforce?  On the back end, are we doing more to link them up with reentry programs that are effective?  And this may be an area where we could have some really significant bipartisan legislation that doesn't eliminate all the other challenges weve got.  Because the most important goal is keeping folks from getting in the criminal justice system in the first place, which means early childhood education and good jobs, and making sure that we're not segregating folks in impoverished communities that have no contact with opportunity. But this can make a difference.  I met these four ex-offenders, as I said, yesterday, and what was remarkable was how they had turned their lives around.  And these were some folks who had been some pretty tough criminals.  One of them had served 10 years; another was a repeat offender that had served a lot of time.  And in each instance, somebody intervened at some point in their lives -- once they had already been in the criminal justice system, once they had already gotten in trouble -- and said, you know what, I think you can live a different way, and Im willing to help you.  And that one person, an art teacher, or a GED teacher, or somebody who was willing to offer a guy a job -- I want to give a shout-out to Five Guys, because one of the guys there was an ex-felon, and Five Guys gave him a job.  And he ended up becoming a manager at the store and was able to completely turn his life around.  But the point was, somebody reached out to that person and gave him a chance.  And so part of our question should be, how about somebody reaching out to these guys when theyre 10, or 11, or 12, or eight, as opposed to waiting until theyve already gone through a criminal justice program.  Thats part of why were doing My Brothers Keeper.  But this is an area where I feel modestly optimistic.  I think in the meantime weve got to stay on top of keeping the crime rate down, because part of the reason I think theres a conversation taking place is violent crime has significantly dropped.  Last year, we saw both incarcerations and the crime rate drop, and this can always turn if we start seeing renewed problems in terms of violent crime.  And theres parts of the country where violent crime is still a real problem, including my hometown of Chicago, and in Baltimore. And part of what Ive asked Attorney General Lynch to do is to figure out how can we refocus attention.  If were going to do a package of criminal justice reforms, part of it would be actually having a greater police presence and more law enforcement in the communities that are really getting hit hard and havent seen some of the drops in violent crime that weve seen in places like Manhattan, for example. With respect to the visit to Kenya, its obviously something Im looking forward to.  Ill be honest with you, visiting Kenya as a private citizen is probably more meaningful to me than visiting as President because I can actually get outside of a hotel room or a conference center.  And just the logistics of visiting a place are always tough as President, but its obviously symbolically important.  And my hope is, is that we can deliver a message that the U.S. is a strong partner not just for Kenya, but for Sub-Saharan Africa generally; build on the progress thats been made around issues of health and education; focus on counterterrorism issues that are important in East Africa because of al-Shabaab and some of the tragedies that have happened inside of Kenya; and continue to encourage democracy and the reduction of corruption inside that country that sometimes has held back this incredibly gifted and blessed country. And with respect to the Medal of Freedom, theres no precedent for revoking a medal.  We dont have that mechanism.  And as you know, I tend to make it a policy not to comment on the specifics of cases where there might still be, if not criminal, then civil issues involved. Ill say this:  If you give a woman -- or a man, for that matter -- without his or her knowledge, a drug, and then have sex with that person without consent, thats rape.  And I think this country -- any civilized country -- should have no tolerance for rape.  All right.  Have we exhausted Iran questions here?  I think theres a helicopter thats coming.  But I really am enjoying this Iran debate.  Topics that may not have been touched upon, criticisms that youve heard that I did not answer?  Go ahead.  I know Josh is getting a little stressed here -- but I just want to make sure that were not leaving any stones unturned here.  Go ahead. Question:   Thanks, Mr. President.  Ill be brief.  The argument has been made that Iran now has a cash windfall, billions to spend.  Your people seem confident theyre going to spend it at home.  Why are you confident theyre not going to spend it on arming Hezbollah, arming Bashar al-Assad, et cetera? President Obama:  I think thats a great question and Im glad you brought it up.  I think it is a mistake to characterize our belief that they will just spend it on daycare centers, and roads, and paying down debt.  We think that they have to do some of that, because Rouhani was elected specifically on the premise of improving the economic situation inside of Iran.  That economy has tanked since we imposed sanctions. So the notion that they're just immediately going to turn over $100 billion to the IRGC or the Quds Force I think runs contrary to all the intelligence that weve seen and the commitments that the Iranian government has made. Do we think that with the sanctions coming down, that Iran will have some additional resources for its military and for some of the activities in the region that are a threat to us and a threat to our allies?  I think that is a likelihood that theyve got some additional resources.  Do I think its a game-changer for them?  No. They are currently supporting Hezbollah, and there is a ceiling -- a pace at which they could support Hezbollah even more, particularly in the chaos that's taking place in Syria.  So can they potentially try to get more assistance there?  Yes.  Should we put more resources into blocking them from getting that assistance to Hezbollah?  Yes.  Is the incremental additional money that theyve got to try to destabilize the region or send to their proxies, is that more important than preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon?  No.  So I think -- again, this is a matter of us making a determination of what is our priority. The other problem with the argument that folks have been making about, oh, this is a windfall and suddenly Iran is flushed with cash, and they're going to take over the world.  And I say that not tongue-in-cheek, because if you look at some of the statements by some of our critics, you would think that Iran is, in fact, going to take over the world as a consequence of this deal -- which I think would be news to the Iranians. That argument is also premised on the notion that if there is no deal, if Congress votes down this deal, that we're able to keep sanctions in place with the same vigor and effectiveness as we have right now.  And that, I can promise you, is not true.  That is absolutely not true.  I want to repeat:  We're not writing Iran a check.  This is Irans money that we were able to block from them having access to.  That required the cooperation of countries all around the world, many of whom really want to purchase oil from Iran.  The imposition of sanctions -- their cooperation with us -- has cost them billions of dollars, made it harder for them.  Theyve been willing to do that because theyve believed we were sincere about trying to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully, and they considered that a priority -- a high enough priority that they were willing to cooperate with us on sanctions.  If they saw us walking away, or more specifically, if they saw the U.S. Congress effectively vetoing the judgment of 99 percent of the world community that this is a deal that resolves the Iranian weapons program -- nuclear weapons program in an equitable way, the sanctions system unravels.  And so we could still maintain some of our unilateral sanctions, but it would be far less effective -- as it was before we were able to put together these multilateral sanctions. So maybe they don't get $100 billion; maybe they get $60 billion or $70 billion instead.  The price for that that weve paid is that now Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon.  We have no inspectors on the ground.  We don't know whats going on.  Theyre still getting some cash windfall.  Weve lost credibility in the eyes of the world.  We will have effectively united Iran and divided ourselves from our allies.  A terrible position to be in.  I'm just going to look -- I made some notes about any of the arguments -- the other arguments that Ive heard here.  Question:   What about -- [off-mic] -- the end of the deal?  President Obama:  Okay, yes, thats a good one.  The notion -- Question:   At the end of the deal they could go back -- President Obama:  Right.  Well, so lets address this issue of -- because thats the other big argument thats been made.  All right, lets assume that the deal holds for 10 years, Iran doesnt cheat.  Now, at the end of 10 years, some of the restrictions have been lifted -- although, remember, others stay in place for 15 years.  So for example, theyve still got to keep their stockpiles at a minimal level for 15 years.  The inspections dont go away; those are still in place 15, 20 years from now.  Their commitment under the Non-Proliferation Treaty does not go away; thats still in place.  The additional protocol that they have to sign up for under this deal, which requires a more extensive inspection and verification mechanism -- that stays in place. So theres no scenario in which a U.S. President is not in a stronger position 12, 13, 15 years from now if, in fact, Iran decided at that point they still wanted to get a nuclear weapon.  Keep in mind, we will have maintained a one-year breakout time, we will have rolled back their program, frozen their facilities, kept them under severe restrictions, had observers.  They will have made international commitments supported by countries around the world.  And -- hold on a second -- and if at that point they finally decided, you know what, were going to cheat, or not even cheat -- at that point, they decide openly were now pursuing a nuclear weapon -- theyre still in violation of this deal and the commitments theyve made internationally.  And so we are still in a position to mobilize the world community to say, no, you cant have a nuclear weapon.  And theyre not in a stronger position to get a nuclear weapon at that point; theyre in a weaker position than they are today.  And, by the way, we havent given away any of our military capabilities.  Were not in a weaker position to respond.  So even if everything the critics were saying was true -- that at the end of 10 years, or 12 years, or 15 years, Iran now is in a position to decide it wants a nuclear weapon, that theyre at a breakout point -- they wont be at a breakout point that is more dangerous than the breakout point theyre in right now.  They wont be at a breakout point that is shorter than the one that exists today.  And so why wouldnt we at least make sure that for the next 10, 15, years they are not getting a nuclear weapon and we can verify it; and afterwards, if they decide if theyve changed their mind, we are then much more knowledgeable about what their capabilities are, much more knowledgeable about what their program is, and still in a position to take whatever actions we would take today? Question:  So none of this is holding out hope that theyll change their behavior? President Obama:  No. Question:  Nothing different -- President Obama:  No.  Look, I'm always hopeful that behavior may change for the sake of the Iranian people as well as people in the region.  There are young people there who are not getting the opportunities they deserve because of conflict, because of sectarianism, because of poor governance, because of repression, because of terrorism.  And I remain eternally hopeful that we can do something about that, and it should be part of U.S. foreign policy to do something about that.  But I'm not banking on that to say that this deal is the right thing to do. Again, it is incumbent on the critics of this deal to explain how an American President is in a worse position 12, 13, 14, 15 years from now if, in fact, at that point Iran says were going to pull out of the NPT, kick out inspectors and go for a nuclear bomb.  If that happens, that President will be in a better position than what happened if Iran, as a consequence of Congress rejecting this deal, decides thats it, were done negotiating, were going after a bomb right now.  The choices would be tougher today than they would be for that President 15 years from now.  And I have not yet heard logic that refutes that. All right.  I really have to go now.  I think weve hit the big themes.  But I promise you, I will address this again.  All right?", "filename": "15July2015PostIranNuclearAccordAgreementPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "I visited our troops in Afghanistan last year to thank them on behalf of a grateful nation.  I told them they could take great pride in the progress that they helped achieve.  They struck devastating blows against the al Qaeda leadership in the tribal regions, delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, prevented terrorist attacks, and saved American lives.  They pushed the Taliban back so the Afghan people could reclaim their communities, send their daughters to school, and improve their lives.  Our troops trained Afghan forces so they could take the lead for their own security and protect Afghans as they voted in historic elections, leading to the first democratic transfer of power in their countrys history.   Today, American forces no longer patrol Afghan villages or valleys.  Our troops are not engaged in major ground combat against the Taliban.  Those missions now belong to Afghans, who are fully responsible for securing their country.   But as Ive said before, while Americas combat mission in Afghanistan may be over, our commitment to Afghanistan and its people endures.  As Commander-in-Chief, I will not allow Afghanistan to be used as safe haven for terrorists to attack our nation again.  Our forces therefore remain engaged in two narrow but critical missions -- training Afghan forces, and supporting counterterrorism operations against the remnants of al Qaeda.  Of course, compared to the 100,000 troops we once had in Afghanistan, today fewer than 10,000 remain, in support of these very focused missions. I meet regularly with my national security team, including commanders in Afghanistan, to continually assess, honestly, the situation on the ground -- to determine where our strategy is working and where we may need greater flexibility.  I have insisted, consistently, that our strategy focus on the development of a sustainable Afghan capacity and self-sufficiency.  And when weve needed additional forces to advance that goal, or weve needed to make adjustments in terms of our timetables, then weve made those adjustments.  Today, I want to update the American people on our efforts. Since taking the lead for security earlier this year, Afghan forces have continued to step up.  This has been the first fighting season where Afghans have largely been on their own.  And they are fighting for their country bravely and tenaciously.  Afghan forces continue to hold most urban areas.  And when the Taliban has made gains, as in Kunduz, Afghan forces backed by coalition support have been able to push them back.  This has come at a very heavy price.  This year alone, thousands of Afghan troops and police have lost their lives, as have many Afghan civilians. At the same time, Afghan forces are still not as strong as they need to be.  Theyre developing critical capabilities -- intelligence, logistics, aviation, command and control.  And meanwhile, the Taliban has made gains, particularly in rural areas, and can still launch deadly attacks in cities, including Kabul.  Much of this was predictable.  We understood that as we transitioned, that the Taliban would try to exploit some of our movements out of particular areas, and that it would take time for Afghan security forces to strengthen.  Pressure from Pakistan has resulted in more al Qaeda coming into Afghanistan, and weve seen the emergence of an ISIL presence.  The bottom line is, in key areas of the country, the security situation is still very fragile, and in some places there is risk of deterioration.   Fortunately, in President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah there is a national unity government that supports a strong partnership with the United States.  During their visit earlier this year, President Ghani and I agreed to continue our counterterrorism cooperation, and he has asked for continued support as Afghan forces grow stronger.   Following consultations with my entire national security team, as well as our international partners and members of Congress, President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah, Im therefore announcing the following steps, which I am convinced offer the best possibility for lasting progress in Afghanistan. First, Ive decided to maintain our current posture of 9,800 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year, 2016.  Their mission will not change.  Our troops will continue to pursue those two narrow tasks that I outlined earlier -- training Afghan forces and going after al Qaeda.  But maintaining our current posture through most of next year, rather than a more rapid drawdown, will allow us to sustain our efforts to train and assist Afghan forces as they grow stronger -- not only during this fighting season, but into the next one. Second, I have decided that instead of going down to a normal embassy presence in Kabul by the end of 2016, we will maintain 5,500 troops at a small number of bases, including at Bagram, Jalalabad in the east, and Kandahar in the south.   Again, the mission will not change.  Our troops will focus on training Afghans and counterterrorism operations.  But these bases will give us the presence and the reach our forces require to achieve their mission.  In this sense, Afghanistan is a key piece of the network of counterterrorism partnerships that we need, from South Asia to Africa, to deal more broadly with terrorist threats quickly and prevent attacks against our homeland.  Third, we will work with allies and partners to align the steps I am announcing today with their own presence in Afghanistan after 2016.  In Afghanistan, we are part of a 42-nation coalition, and our NATO allies and partners can continue to play an indispensable role in helping Afghanistan strengthen its security forces, including respect for human rights.    And finally, because governance and development remain the foundation for stability and progress in Afghanistan, we will continue to support President Ghani and the national unity government as they pursue critical reforms.  New provincial governors have been appointed, and President Ghani is working to combat corruption, strengthen institutions, and uphold rule of law.  As I told President Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah yesterday, efforts that deliver progress and justice for the Afghan people will continue to have the strong support of the United States.  And we cannot separate the importance of governance with the issues of security.  The more effective these reforms happen, the better off the security situation is going to be. We also discussed American support of an Afghan-led reconciliation process.  By now it should be clear to the Taliban and all who oppose Afghanistans progress the only real way to achieve the full drawdown of U.S. and foreign troops from Afghanistan is through a lasting political settlement with the Afghan government.  Likewise, sanctuaries for the Taliban and other terrorists must end.  Next week, Ill host Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan, and I will continue to urge all parties in the region to press the Taliban to return to peace talks and to do their part in pursuit of the peace that Afghans deserve.   In closing, I want to speak directly to those whose lives are most directly affected most by the decisions Im announcing today.  To the Afghan people, who have suffered so much -- Americans commitment to you and to a secure, stable and unified Afghanistan, that remains firm.  Our two nations have forged a strategic partnership for the long term.  And as you defend and build your country, today is a reminder that the United States keeps our commitments.     And to our men and women in uniform -- I know this means that some of you will rotate back into Afghanistan.  With the end of our combat mission, this is not like 2010, when nearly 500 Americans were killed and many more were injured.  But still, Afghanistan remains dangerous; 25 brave Americans have given their lives there this year.   I do not send you into harms way lightly.  Its the most solemn decision I make.  I know the wages of war in the wounded warriors I visit in the hospital and in the grief of Gold Star families.  But as your Commander-in-Chief, I believe this mission is vital to our national security interests in preventing terrorist attacks against our citizens and our nation. And to the American people -- I know that many of you have grown weary of this conflict.  As you are well aware, I do not support the idea of endless war, and I have repeatedly argued against marching into open-ended military conflicts that do not serve our core security interests.   Yet given whats at stake in Afghanistan, and the opportunity for a stable and committed ally that can partner with us in preventing the emergence of future threats, and the fact that we have an international coalition, I am firmly convinced that we should make this extra effort.  In the Afghan government, we have a serious partner who wants our help.  And the majority of the Afghan people share our goals.  We have a bilateral security agreement to guide our cooperation.  And every single day, Afghan forces are out there fighting and dying to protect their country.  Theyre not looking for us to do it for them.  Im speaking of the Afghan army cadet who grew up seeing bombings and attacks on innocent civilians who said, because of this, I took the decision to join the army, to try and save innocent peoples lives.  Or the police officer training to defuse explosives.  I know its dangerous work, he says, but I have always had a dream of wearing the uniform of Afghanistan, serving my people and defending my country. Or the Afghan commando, a hardened veteran of many missions, who said, If I start telling you the stories of my life, I might start crying.  He serves, he said, because, the faster we bring peace, the faster we can bring education, and the stronger our unity will grow.  Only if these things happen will Afghanistan be able to stand up for itself.  My fellow Americans, after so many years of war, Afghanistan will not be a perfect place.  Its a poor country that will have to work hard on its development.  There will continue to be contested areas.  But Afghans like these are standing up for their country.  If they were to fail, it would endanger the security of us all.  And weve made an enormous investment in a stable Afghanistan.  Afghans are making difficult but genuine progress.  This modest but meaningful extension of our presence -- while sticking to our current, narrow missions -- can make a real difference.  Its the right thing to do.   May God bless our troops and all who keep us safe.  And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Question:  Mr. President, can you tell us how disappointing this decision is for you?  Is this -- can you tell us how disappointing this decision is for you?", "filename": "15October2015AfghanistanStatement.txt"}, {"question": "We gather here in memory of twenty beautiful children and six remarkable adults.  They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school; in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America. Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation.  I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts.  I can only hope it helps for you to know that youre not alone in your grief; that our world too has been torn apart; that all across this land of ours, we have wept with you, weve pulled our children tight.  And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide; whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it. Newtown -- you are not alone. As these difficult days have unfolded, youve also inspired us with stories of strength and resolve and sacrifice.  We know that when danger arrived in the halls of Sandy Hook Elementary, the schools staff did not flinch, they did not hesitate.  Dawn Hochsprung and Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, Lauren Rousseau, Rachel Davino and Anne Marie Murphy -- they responded as we all hope we might respond in such terrifying circumstances -- with courage and with love, giving their lives to protect the children in their care. We know that there were other teachers who barricaded themselves inside classrooms, and kept steady through it all, and reassured their students by saying \"wait for the good guys, theyre coming\"; \"show me your smile.\" And we know that good guys came.  The first responders who raced to the scene, helping to guide those in harms way to safety, and comfort those in need, holding at bay their own shock and trauma because they had a job to do, and others needed them more. And then there were the scenes of the schoolchildren, helping one another, holding each other, dutifully following instructions in the way that young children sometimes do; one child even trying to encourage a grown-up by saying, \"I know karate.  So its okay.  Ill lead the way out.\" As a community, youve inspired us, Newtown.  In the face of indescribable violence, in the face of unconscionable evil, youve looked out for each other, and youve cared for one another, and youve loved one another.  This is how Newtown will be remembered.  And with time, and Gods grace, that love will see you through. But we, as a nation, we are left with some hard questions.  Someone once described the joy and anxiety of parenthood as the equivalent of having your heart outside of your body all the time, walking around.  With their very first cry, this most precious, vital part of ourselves -- our child -- is suddenly exposed to the world, to possible mishap or malice.  And every parent knows there is nothing we will not do to shield our children from harm.  And yet, we also know that with that childs very first step, and each step after that, they are separating from us; that we wont -- that we cant always be there for them.  Theyll suffer sickness and setbacks and broken hearts and disappointments.  And we learn that our most important job is to give them what they need to become self-reliant and capable and resilient, ready to face the world without fear. And we know we cant do this by ourselves.  It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize, no matter how much you love these kids, you cant do it by yourself.  That this job of keeping our children safe, and teaching them well, is something we can only do together, with the help of friends and neighbors, the help of a community, and the help of a nation.  And in that way, we come to realize that we bear a responsibility for every child because were counting on everybody else to help look after ours; that were all parents; that theyre all our children. This is our first task -- caring for our children.  Its our first job.  If we dont get that right, we dont get anything right.  Thats how, as a society, we will be judged. And by that measure, can we truly say, as a nation, that we are meeting our obligations?  Can we honestly say that were doing enough to keep our children -- all of them -- safe from harm?  Can we claim, as a nation, that were all together there, letting them know that they are loved, and teaching them to love in return?  Can we say that were truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose? Ive been reflecting on this the last few days, and if were honest with ourselves, the answer is no.  Were not doing enough.  And we will have to change. Since Ive been President, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by a mass shooting.  The fourth time weve hugged survivors.  The fourth time weve consoled the families of victims.  And in between, there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them children, in small towns and big cities all across America -- victims whose -- much of the time, their only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. We cant tolerate this anymore.  These tragedies must end.  And to end them, we must change.  We will be told that the causes of such violence are complex, and that is true.  No single law -- no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world, or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. But that cant be an excuse for inaction.  Surely, we can do better than this.  If there is even one step we can take to save another child, or another parent, or another town, from the grief that has visited Tucson, and Aurora, and Oak Creek, and Newtown, and communities from Columbine to Blacksburg before that -- then surely we have an obligation to try. In the coming weeks, I will use whatever power this office holds to engage my fellow citizens -- from law enforcement to mental health professionals to parents and educators -- in an effort aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.  Because what choice do we have?  We cant accept events like this as routine.  Are we really prepared to say that were powerless in the face of such carnage, that the politics are too hard?  Are we prepared to say that such violence visited on our children year after year after year is somehow the price of our freedom? All the worlds religions -- so many of them represented here today -- start with a simple question:  Why are we here?  What gives our life meaning?  What gives our acts purpose?", "filename": "16December2012NewtownConnecticutInterfaithVigilSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "For 50 years, leaders and people across Southeast Asia have worked together through ASEAN to advance their mutual security, prosperity and dignity.  For decades, the United States has been a proud partner with ASEAN.  And this summit has built on the unprecedented cooperation weve forged over the past seven years, as I described yesterday.  This spirit -- working together on behalf of mutual interests, in mutual respect -- guided our work over the past two days.  And so I especially want to thank my fellow leaders from the ASEAN countries for being here, for their commitment and for the progress that weve made together. One of my main messages over the past two days has been the commitment of the United States to ASEAN and its people.  That commitment is and will remain strong and enduring.  With our Strategic Partnership, we have a framework to guide our ties for decades to come. Here at Sunnylands, we agreed to a number of key principles, including the principle that ASEAN will continue to be central -- in fact, indispensable -- to peace, prosperity and progress in the Asia Pacific.  When ASEAN speaks with a clear, unified voice, it can help advance security, opportunity and human dignity not only for the more than 600 million people across ASEAN, but for people across the Asia Pacific and around the world.  And Im pleased that, here at this summit, ASEANs strong voice allowed us to make progress on multiple fronts. First, we agreed to do more together to encourage the entrepreneurship and innovation that are at the heart of modern, competitive economies.  We had an excellent discussion with a number of pioneering business leaders who reiterated the recipe for attracting trade and investment -- rule of law, transparency, protection of intellectual property, efficient customs, modern infrastructure, e-commerce and the free flow of information, support for small and medium-sized businesses, and perhaps most importantly, investment in people -- investment in strong schools to educate and train the next generation. Around the table, there was widespread recognition that this is the path ASEAN countries need to continue on.  As they do, it will create even more opportunities for trade and investment between the U.S. and ASEAN countries. I affirmed our strong support for the ASEAN Community and pledged that the United States will continue to be a partner in ASEANs efforts to integrate economies and reduce barriers to trade and investment.  Im also announcing a new initiative -- U.S.-ASEAN Connect -- a network of hubs across the region to better coordinate our economic engagement and connect more of our entrepreneurs, investors and businesses with each other. Were also doing more to help aspiring innovators in the region learn English, the international language of business.  And I reiterated that the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- which includes four ASEAN members -- can advance economic integration across ASEAN and set stronger rules for trade throughout the Asia Pacific.  To that end, weve launched a new effort to help all ASEAN countries understand the key elements of TPP, as well as the reforms that could eventually lead to them joining. Second, with regard to security, the United States and ASEAN are reaffirming our strong commitment to a regional order where international rules and norms -- and the rights of all nations, large and small -- are upheld.  We discussed the need for tangible steps in the South China Sea to lower tensions, including a halt to further reclamation, new construction and militarization of disputed areas.  Freedom of navigation must be upheld and lawful commerce should not be impeded. I reiterated that the United States will continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows, and we will support the right of all countries to do the same.  We will continue to help our allies and partners strengthen their maritime capabilities.  And we discussed how any disputes between claimants in the region must be resolved peacefully, through legal means, such as the upcoming arbitration ruling under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Seas, which the parties are obligated to respect and abide by. Third, I made it clear that the United States will continue to stand with those across Southeast Asia who are working to advance rule of law, good governance, accountable institutions and the universal human rights of all people.  We continue to encourage a return to civilian rule in Thailand.  We will sustain our engagement with the people of Myanmar as a new president is selected, and as they work to implement the ceasefire agreement and move forward with national reconciliation. Across the region, well continue to stand with citizens and civil society and defend their freedom of speech, of assembly and of the press.  No one, including those in political opposition, should ever be detained or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind.  That only stymies progress, only makes it harder for countries to truly thrive and prosper. And finally, the United States and ASEAN are doing more to deal with transnational challenges together.  I offered our assistance to help ASEAN counties better leverage Interpol data to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters.  We agree that implementing the Paris climate change agreement, including helping developing countries adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate change, will be critical and it will enable them to leap ahead to new and affordable clean energy. As we pursue our sustainable development goals, were launching a new competition -- an innovation challenge to encourage students across ASEAN to develop new solutions to boost agriculture.  Were moving ahead with our Global Health Security Agenda to prevent future epidemics, and I pledged additional U.S. assistance to help ASEAN combat the horror of human trafficking. So, to sum up, I believe this summit has put the U.S.-ASEAN partnership on a new trajectory that will carry us to even greater heights in the decades ahead.  Americas foreign policy rebalance to the Asia Pacific, including Southeast Asia, will continue to be a foreign policy priority of my presidency.  I look forward to visiting Vietnam for the first time in May and to becoming the first U.S. President to visit Laos when it hosts the East Asia Summit in September. And Im confident that whoever the next President may be will build on the foundation that weve laid, because theres strong, sustained, bipartisan support for American engagement in the Asia Pacific region.  And through our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, our investment in young people, in their business success, and civil society and grassroots leaders across the region I believe will further bind us together in a spirit of partnership and friendship for many years to come. So, with that, let me take a few questions.  And I'm going to start with Darlene Superville of the Associated Press.  Where is Darlene?  There she is. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  My question is about the Supreme Court. President Obama:  I'm shocked. Question:  What recourse do you have if Leader McConnell blocks a vote on your Supreme Court nominee?  And do you think that if you choose someone moderate enough that Republicans might change course and schedule a vote?  And as you consider that choice and who to nominate, what qualities are important to you, and is diversity among them?  Thank you. President Obama:  First of all, I want to reiterate heartfelt condolences to the Scalia family.  Obviously, Justice Scalia and I had different political orientations and probably would have disagreed on the outcome of certain cases.  But theres no doubt that he was a giant on the Supreme Court, helped to shape the legal landscape.  He was, by all accounts, a good friend and loved his family deeply.  And so its important, before we rush into the all the politics of this, to take stock of somebody who made enormous contributions to the United States. And we are grateful not only for his service but for his familys service. The Constitution is pretty clear about what is supposed to happen now.  When there is a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the President of the United States is to nominate someone.  The Senate is to consider that nomination, and either they disapprove of that nominee or that nominee is elevated to the Supreme Court. Historically, this has not been viewed as a question.  Theres no unwritten law that says that it can only be done on off years -- thats not in the constitutional text.  Im amused when I hear people who claim to be strict interpreters of the Constitution suddenly reading into it a whole series of provisions that are not there.  There is more than enough time for the Senate to consider in a thoughtful way the record of a nominee that I present and to make a decision. And with respect to our process, were going to do the same thing that we did with respect to Justice Kagans nomination and Justice Sotomayors nomination.  Were going to find somebody who is has an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law.  Theres not going to be any particular position on a particular issue that determines whether or not I nominate them, but Im going to present somebody who indisputably is qualified for the seat and any fair-minded person -- even somebody who disagreed with my politics -- would say would serve with honor and integrity on the Court. Now, part of the problem that we have here is, is weve almost gotten accustomed to how obstructionist the Senate has become when it comes to nominations.  Ive got 14 nominations that have been pending that were unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee -- so Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary Committee all agreed that they were well-qualified for the position.  And yet we cant get a vote on those individuals. So in some ways, this argument is just an extension of what weve seen in the Senate, generally -- and not just on judicial nominees. The basic function of government requires that the President of the United States, in his or her duties, has a team of people -- Cabinet secretaries, assistant secretaries -- that can carry out the basic functions of government.  It requires -- the Constitution requires that we appoint judges so that they can carry out their functions as a separate branch of government. And the fact that weve almost grown accustomed to a situation that is almost unprecedented, where every nomination is contested, everything is blocked regardless of how qualified the person is, even when theres no ideological objection to them, certainly where theres no disqualifying actions by the nominee that have surfaced -- the fact that its that hard, that were even discussing this, is I think a measure of how, unfortunately, the venom and rancor in Washington has prevented us from getting basic work done.  This would be a good moment for us to rise above that. I understand the stakes.  I understand the pressure that Republican senators are, undoubtedly, under.  I mean, the fact of the matter is, is that what the issue here is, is that the Court is now divided on many issues; this would be a deciding vote.  And there are a lot of Republican senators who are going to be under a lot of pressure from various special interests and various constituencies and many of their voters to not let any nominee go through, no matter who I nominate.  But thats not how the system is supposed to work.  Thats not how our democracy is supposed to work. And I intend to nominate in due time a very well-qualified candidate.  If we are following basic precedent, then that nominee will be presented before the committees; the vote will be taken; and ultimately, theyll be confirmed.  Justice Kennedy, when he was nominated by Ronald Reagan -- in Ronald Reagans last year in office, a vote was taken, and there were a whole lot of Democrats who Im sure did not agree with Justice Kennedy on his position on a variety of issues -- but they did the right thing; they confirmed him.  And if they voted against him, they certainly didnt mount a filibuster to block a vote from even coming up. This is the Supreme Court.  The highest court in the land.  Its the one court where we would expect elected officials to rise above day-to-day politics.  And this will be the opportunity for senators to do their job.  Your job doesnt stop until youre voted out or until your term expires.  I intend to do my job between now and January 20th of 2017.  I expect them to do their job as well. All right.  Lets see who weve got here.  Jeff Mason. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Following up on that, should we interpret your comments just now that you are likely to choose a moderate nominee?  Would you -- President Obama:  No. Question:  Okay. President Obama:  I dont know where you found that.  You shouldnt assume anything about the qualifications of the nominee other than theyre going to be well-qualified. Question:  All right. President Obama:  Okay. Question:  Following up, would you consider a recess appointment if your nominee is not granted a hearing? President Obama:  I think that we have more than enough time to go through regular order, regular processes.  I intend to nominate somebody, to present them to the American people, to present them to the Senate.  I expect them to hold hearings.  I expect there to be a vote. Question:   That means no recess appointment? President Obama:  Full stop. Question:  And lastly, as long as were doing this in a row, how do you respond to Republican criticism that your position is undercut by the fact that you and other members of your administration who were in the Senate at the time tried to filibuster Judge Alito in 2006? President Obama:  Look, I think whats fair to say is that how judicial nominations have evolved over time is not historically the fault of any single party.  This has become just one more extension of politics.  And there are times where folks are in the Senate and theyre thinking, as I just described, primarily about, is this going to cause me problems in a primary? Is this going to cause me problems with supporters of mine?  And so people take strategic decisions.  I understand that. But what is also true is Justice Alito is on the bench right now.  I think that, historically, if you look at it, regardless of what votes particular senators have taken, theres been a basic consensus, a basic understanding, that the Supreme Court is different.  And each caucus may decide whos going to vote where and what but that basically you let the vote come up, and you make sure that a well-qualified candidate is able to join the bench, even if you dont particularly agree with them.  And my expectation is, is that the same should happen here. Now, this will be a test -- one more test -- of whether or not norms, rules, basic fair play can function at all in Washington these days.  But I do want to point out, this is not just the Supreme Court.  We have consistently seen just a breakdown in the basic functions of government because the Senate will not confirm well-qualified nominees even when theyre voted out of committee, which means that theyre voted by both parties without objection. And we still have problems, because theres a certain mindset that says were just going to grind the system down to a halt, and if we dont like the President then were just not going to let him make any appointments.  Were going to make it tougher for the administration to do their basic job.  Were going to make sure that ambassadors arent seated, even though these are critical countries and it may have an effect on our international relations.  Were going to make sure that judges arent confirmed, despite the fact that Justice Roberts, himself, has pointed out theres emergencies in courts around the country because there are just not enough judges and there are too many cases, and the system is breaking down. So this has become a habit.  And it gets worse and worse each year.  And its not something that I have spent a huge amount of time talking about, because, frankly, the American people, on average, theyre more interested in gas prices and wages and issues that touch on their day-to-day lives in a more direct way, so it doesnt get a lot of political attention. But this is the Supreme Court.  And its going to get some attention.  And we have to ask ourselves as a society a fundamental question:  Are we able to still make this democracy work the way its supposed to, the way our Founders envisioned it?  And I would challenge anyone who purports to be adhering to the original intent of the Founders, anybody who believes in the Constitution, coming up with a plausible rationale as to why they would not even have a hearing for a nominee made in accordance with the Constitution by the President of the United States --with a year left, practically, in office.  Its pretty hard to find that in the Constitution. All right.  Youve gotten at least -- youve gotten four now, Jeff. Toluse. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Two different topics -- first on Syria.  Last year, when President Putin was about to enter into Syria, you said that he was doing so from a position of weakness and that he would only get himself involved in a quagmire there.  Now, with Aleppo about to fall, it seems like President Putin is basically getting one of his goals, which is to bolster Assad and to take out the rebels, which the U.S. is backing.  How do you respond to critics who say that you have been outfoxed by Putin?  And what is your plan if Aleppo does fall?  Do you plan to step up military action to help the rebels in Syria, who you have said are key to taking on ISIS? And then secondly, I wanted to ask you about 2016 as well. President Obama:  Okay, this is getting to be a lot of questions here.  How about -- you asked me a big question right there.  How about I just answer that one? Question:  Okay, sure. President Obama:  All right. First of all, if you look back at the transcripts, what I said was that Russia has been propping up Assad this entire time. The fact that Putin finally had to send his own troops and his own aircraft and invest this massive military operation was not a testament to a great strength; it was a testament to the weakness of Assads position.  That if somebody is strong, then you dont have to send in your army to prop up your ally.  They have legitimacy in their country and they are able to manage it their self, and then you have good relations with them.  You send in your army when the horse youre backing isnt effective.  And thats exactly whats happened. Now, what I said was, is that Russia would involve itself in a quagmire.  Absolutely, it will.  If theres anybody who thinks that somehow the fighting ends because Russia and the regime has made some initial advances -- about three-quarters of the country is still under control of folks other than Assad.  Thats not stopping anytime soon. I say that, by the way, with no pleasure.  This is not a contest between me and Putin.  The question is, how can we stop the suffering, stabilize the region, stop this massive out-migration of refugees who are having such a terrible time, end the violence, stop the bombing of schools and hospitals and innocent civilians, stop creating a safe haven for ISIS.  And theres nothing thats happened over the last several weeks that points to those issues being solved.  And that is what I mean by a quagmire. Now, Putin may think that hes prepared to invest in a permanent occupation of Syria with Russian military.  Thats going to be pretty costly.  Thats going to be a big piece of business.  And if you look at the state of the Russian economy, thats probably not the best thing for Russia. What would be smarter would be for Russia to work with the United States and other parties in the international community to try to broker some sort of political transition.  Now, John Kerry, working with his Russian counterpart, has, on paper, said that theres going to be a cessation of hostilities in a few days.  This will test whether or not thats possible.  Its hard to do because theres been a lot of bloodshed.  And if Russia continues indiscriminate bombing of the sort that weve been seeing, I think its fair to say that youre not going to see any take-up by the opposition. And, yes, Russia has a major military.  Obviously, a bunch of rebels are not going to be able to compete with the hardware of the second-most powerful military in the world.  But that doesnt solve the problem of actually stabilizing Syria.  And the only way to do that is to bring about some sort of political transition. We will see what happens over the next several days.  And we will continue to work with our partners who are focused on defeating ISIS to also see how we can work together to try to bring about a more lasting political solution than aerial bombardment of schools and hospitals are going to achieve. But its hard.  Im under no illusions here that this is going to be easy.  A country has been shattered because Assad was willing to shatter it, and has repeatedly missed opportunities to try to arrive at a political transition.  And Russia has been party to that entire process.  And the real question we should be asking is what is it that Russia thinks it gains if it gets a country thats been completely destroyed as an ally that it now has to perpetually spend billions of dollars to prop up?  Thats not that great a prize.  Unfortunately, the problem is, is that it has spillover effects that are impacting everybody, and thats what we have to focus on. One thing that I do want to add, though -- this has not distracted us from continuing to focus on ISIL.  And we continue to press them hard both in Iraq and Syria.  That will not stop.  And if we can get a political transition in Syria, that allows us to coordinate more effectively with not just Russia, but other countries in the region to focus on the folks who pose the greatest direct threat to the United States. All right.  Andrew Beatty. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask you, first of all, whether you think that military intervention will be necessary in Libya to dislodge the Islamic State from Sirte?  And as an extension of that, do you think that by the end of your presidency the Islamic State will still have geographical strongholds throughout the Middle East?  And, I'm sorry, I can't resist asking a third -- how was the stadium course?  What did you shoot? President Obama:  The last, for non-golfers, is a reference to PGA West.  Very nice course; very difficult.  My score is classified. With respect to Libya, I have been clear from the outset that we will go after ISIS wherever it appears, the same way that we went after al Qaeda wherever they appeared.  And the testament to the fact that we are doing that already is that we took out ISIS -- one of ISISs most prominent leaders in Libya. We will continue to take actions where we've got a clear operation and a clear target in mind.  And we are working with our other coalition partners to make sure that as we see opportunities to prevent ISIS from digging in, in Libya, we take them.  At the same time, we're working diligently with the United Nations to try to get a government in place in Libya.  And that's been a problem. The tragedy of Libya over the last several years is Libya has a relatively small population and a lot of oil wealth and could be really successful.  They are divided by tribal lines and ethnic lines, power plays.  There is now, I think, a recognition on the part of a broad middle among their political leadership that it makes sense to unify so that there is just some semblance of a state there, but extremes on either side are still making it difficult for that state to cohere. If we can get that done, that will be enormously helpful, because our strong preference, as has always been the case, is to train Libyans to fight.  And the good news in Libya is, is that they don't like outsiders coming in, telling them what to do.  Theres a whole bunch of constituencies who are hardened fighters and don't ascribe to ISIS or their perverted ideology.  But they have to be organized and can't be fighting each other.  And so that's probably as important as anything that we're going to be doing in Libya over the coming months. Carol Lee. Question:   Thank you, Mr. President.  The Democratic race to replace you has gotten pretty heated lately, and you have Hillary Clinton saying that -- or at least casting herself as the rightful heir to your legacy and the one, the candidate who will be the keeper of your legacy, while also saying the Bernie Sanders has been disloyal to you.  Is she right? President Obama:  Well, that's the great thing about primaries, is everybody is trying to differentiate themselves, when, in fact, Bernie and Hillary agree on a lot of stuff and disagree pretty much across the board with everything the Republicans stand for.  So my hope is, is that we can let the primary voters and caucus-goers have their say for a while, and lets see how this thing plays itself out. I know Hillary better than I know Bernie because she served in my administration and she was an outstanding Secretary of State.  And I suspect that on certain issues she agrees with me more than Bernie does.  On the other hand, there may be a couple issues where Bernie agrees with me more.  I don't know.  I havent studied their positions that closely. Heres what I have confidence in -- that Democratic voters believe in certain principles.  They believe in equal opportunity.  They believe in making sure that every kid in this country gets a fair shot.  They believe in making sure that economic growth is broad-based and everybody benefits from it, and if you work hard you're not in poverty.  They believe in preserving a strong safety net through programs like Social Security and Medicare.  They believe in a foreign policy that is not reckless, that is tough and protects the American people but doesnt shoot before it aims.  They believe in climate change.  They think science matters.  They think that it's important for us to have some basic regulations to keep our air clean and our water clean, and to make sure that banks aren't engaging in excesses that can result in the kind of thing that we saw in 2007 and 2008.  So theres a broad convergence of interests around those issues. I think what you're seeing among Democrats right now is a difference in tactics, trying to figure out how do you actually get things done; how do you actually operate in a political environment that's become so polarized; how do you deal with the power of special interests, and frankly, how do you deal with a Republican Party right now that has moved so far to the right that it's often hard to find common ground. And so that's, I think, the debate that's taking place right now.  It's a healthy debate.  Ultimately, I will probably have an opinion on it, based on both being a candidate of hope and change and a President whos got some nicks and cuts and bruises from getting stuff done over the last seven years.  But for now, I think it's important for Democratic voters to express themselves and for the candidates to be run through the paces. The thing I can say unequivocally, Carol is I'm not unhappy that I am not on the ballot. Ron Allen, NBC. Question:   Let me continue the 2016 questions.  On the Republican side -- and a lot of your guests were probably very intrigued by the fact that theres a candidate whos still winning whos called for a ban on Muslims, and significant segments of the population in America agree -- President Obama:  Intrigued is an interesting way of putting it. Question:   Struck -- well, what was their reaction?  That's one of my five questions.  But the point is -- President Obama:  Ron, lets stick to two. Question:  The point is, in the past you've explained that as anger, resentment, insecurity -- economic insecurity.  The question is how much responsibility do you accept for that reservoir of feeling in the country that's propelling that sort of candidate?  And a couple weeks ago, you told Matt Lauer that Donald Trump would not win the presidency.  Do you now think that he will not win the nomination, as well?  And what about Rubio, and what about Cruz? President Obama:  I think foreign observers are troubled by some of the rhetoric that's been taking place in these Republican primaries and Republican debates.  I don't think its restricted, by the way, to Mr. Trump.  I find it interesting that everybody is focused on Trump, primarily just because he says in more interesting ways what the other candidates are saying, as well. So he may up the ante in anti-Muslim sentiment, but if you look at what the other Republican candidates have said, that's pretty troubling, too.  He may express strong, anti-immigration sentiment, but you've heard that from the other candidates, as well.  You've got a candidate who sponsored a bill -- that I supported -- to finally solve the immigration problem, and hes running away from it as fast as he can. They're all denying climate change.  I think that's troubling to the international community, since the science is unequivocal.  And the other countries around the world, they kind of count on the United States being on the side of science and reason and common sense, because they know that if the United States does not act on big problems in smart ways, nobody will. But this is not just Mr. Trump.  Look at the statements that are being made by the other candidates.  There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change; that thinks its serious.  Well, that's a problem.  The rest of the world looks at that and says, how can that be? Ill leave it to you to speculate on how this whole race is going to go.  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be President.  And the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I think they recognize that being President is a serious job.  Its not hosting a talk show or a reality show.  Its not promotion.  Its not marketing. Its hard.  And a lot of people count on us getting it right.  And its not a matter of pandering and doing whatever will get you in the news on a given day.  And sometimes it requires you making hard decisions even when people don't like it, and doing things that are unpopular, and standing up for people who are vulnerable but don't have some powerful political constituency.  And it requires being able to work with leaders around the world in a way that reflects the importance of the office; and gives people confidence that you know the facts, and you know their names, and you know where they are on a map, and you know something about their history.  And you're not just going to play to the crowd back home -- because they have their own crowds back home -- and you're trying to solve problems. And so, yes, during primaries, people vent and they express themselves.  And it seems like entertainment, and oftentimes its reported just like entertainment.  But as you get closer, reality has a way of intruding. And these are the folks who I have faith in, because they ultimately are going to say whoever is standing where Im standing right now has the nuclear codes with them, and can order 21-year-olds into a firefight, and have to make sure that the banking system doesn't collapse, and is often responsible for not just the United States of America but 20 other countries that are having big problems or falling apart and are going to be looking for us to do something.  And the American people are pretty sensible and I think theyll make a sensible choice in the end. All right?", "filename": "16February2016U.S-ASEANSummitPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Please -- Please have a seat. Good afternoon, everybody.  Let me begin by thanking our Vice President, Joe Biden, for your dedication, Joe, to this issue, for bringing so many different voices to the table. Because while reducing gun violence is a complicated challenge, protecting our children from harm shouldnt be a divisive one. Over the month since the tragedy in Newtown, weve heard from so many, and, obviously, none have affected us more than the families of those gorgeous children and their teachers and guardians who were lost. And so were grateful to all of you for taking the time to be here, and recognizing that we honor their memories in part by doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again. But we also heard from some unexpected people. In particular, I started getting a lot of letters from kids. Four of them are here today -- Grant Fritz, Julia Stokes, Hinna Zeejah, and Teja Goode. Theyre pretty representative of some of the messages that I got. These are some pretty smart letters from some pretty smart young people. Hinna, a third-grader -- you can go ahead and wave, Hinna. Thats you. Hinna wrote, I feel terrible for the parents who lost their childrenI love my country and [I] want everybody to be happy and safe. And then, Grant -- go ahead and wave, Grant. Grant said, I think there should be some changes. We should learn from what happened at Sandy HookI feel really bad. And then, Julia said -- Julia, where are you? There you go -- Im not scared for my safety, Im scared for others. I have four brothers and sisters and I know I would not be able to bear the thought of losing any of them. These are our kids. This is what theyre thinking about. And so what we should be thinking about is our responsibility to care for them, and shield them from harm, and give them the tools they need to grow up and do everything that theyre capable of doing -- not just to pursue their own dreams, but to help build this country. This is our first task as a society, keeping our children safe. This is how we will be judged. And their voices should compel us to change. And thats why, last month, I asked Joe to lead an effort, along with members of my Cabinet, to come up with some concrete steps we can take right now to keep our children safe, to help prevent mass shootings, to reduce the broader epidemic of gun violence in this country. And we can't put this off any longer. Just last Thursday, as TV networks were covering one of Joes meetings on this topic, news broke of another school shooting, this one in California. In the month since 20 precious children and six brave adults were violently taken from us at Sandy Hook Elementary, more than 900 of our fellow Americans have reportedly died at the end of a gun -- 900 in the past month. And every day we wait, that number will keep growing. So Im putting forward a specific set of proposals based on the work of Joes task force. And in the days ahead, I intend to use whatever weight this office holds to make them a reality. Because while there is no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence completely, no piece of legislation that will prevent every tragedy, every act of evil, if there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there is even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try. And Im going to do my part. As soon as I'm finished speaking here, I will sit at that desk and I will sign a directive giving law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals and the public health community some of the tools they need to help reduce gun violence. We will make it easier to keep guns out of the hands of criminals by strengthening the background check system. We will help schools hire more resource officers if they want them and develop emergency preparedness plans. We will make sure mental health professionals know their options for reporting threats of violence -- even as we acknowledge that someone with a mental illness is far more likely to be a victim of violent crime than the perpetrator. And while year after year, those who oppose even modest gun safety measures have threatened to defund scientific or medical research into the causes of gun violence, I will direct the Centers for Disease Control to go ahead and study the best ways to reduce it -- and Congress should fund research into the effects that violent video games have on young minds. We don't benefit from ignorance. We don't benefit from not knowing the science of this epidemic of violence. These are a few of the 23 executive actions that Im announcing today. But as important as these steps are, they are in no way a substitute for action from members of Congress. To make a real and lasting difference, Congress, too, must act -- and Congress must act soon. And Im calling on Congress to pass some very specific proposals right away. First: Its time for Congress to require a universal background check for anyone trying to buy a gun. The law already requires licensed gun dealers to run background checks, and over the last 14 years thats kept 1.5 million of the wrong people from getting their hands on a gun. But its hard to enforce that law when as many as 40 percent of all gun purchases are conducted without a background check. Thats not safe. That's not smart. Its not fair to responsible gun buyers or sellers.  If you want to buy a gun -- whether its from a licensed dealer or a private seller -- you should at least have to show you are not a felon or somebody legally prohibited from buying one. This is common sense. And an overwhelming majority of Americans agree with us on the need for universal background checks -- including more than 70 percent of the National Rifle Associations members, according to one survey. So theres no reason we cant do this. Second: Congress should restore a ban on military-style assault weapons, and a 10-round limit for magazines. The type of assault rifle used in Aurora, for example, when paired with high-capacity magazines, has one purpose -- to pump out as many bullets as possible, as quickly as possible; to do as much damage, using bullets often designed to inflict maximum damage. And that's what allowed the gunman in Aurora to shoot 70 people -- 70 people -- killing 12 in a matter of minutes. Weapons designed for the theater of war have no place in a movie theater. A majority of Americans agree with us on this. And, by the way, so did Ronald Reagan, one of the staunchest defenders of the Second Amendment, who wrote to Congress in 1994, urging them -- this is Ronald Reagan speaking -- urging them to listen to the American public and to the law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture of [military-style assault] weapons. And finally, Congress needs to help, rather than hinder, law enforcement as it does its job. We should get tougher on people who buy guns with the express purpose of turning around and selling them to criminals. And we should severely punish anybody who helps them do this. Since Congress hasnt confirmed a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in six years, they should confirm Todd Jones, who will be -- who has been Acting, and I will be nominating for the post. And at a time when budget cuts are forcing many communities to reduce their police force, we should put more cops back on the job and back on our streets. Let me be absolutely clear. Like most Americans, I believe the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms. I respect our strong tradition of gun ownership and the rights of hunters and sportsmen. There are millions of responsible, law-abiding gun owners in America who cherish their right to bear arms for hunting, or sport, or protection, or collection. I also believe most gun owners agree that we can respect the Second Amendment while keeping an irresponsible, law-breaking few from inflicting harm on a massive scale. I believe most of them agree that if America worked harder to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like the one that occurred in Newtown. Thats what these reforms are designed to do. Theyre common-sense measures. They have the support of the majority of the American people.  And yet, that doesnt mean any of this is going to be easy to enact or implement. If it were, wed already have universal background checks. The ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines never would have been allowed to expire. More of our fellow Americans might still be alive, celebrating birthdays and anniversaries and graduations. This will be difficult. There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning of a tyrannical, all-out assault on liberty -- not because thats true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue for themselves. And behind the scenes, theyll do everything they can to block any common-sense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever. The only way we will be able to change is if their audience, their constituents, their membership says this time must be different -- that this time, we must do something to protect our communities and our kids.  I will put everything I've got into this, and so will Joe. But I tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it. And by the way, that doesnt just mean from certain parts of the country. We're going to need voices in those areas, in those congressional districts, where the tradition of gun ownership is strong to speak up and to say this is important. It can't just be the usual suspects. We have to examine ourselves and our hearts, and ask ourselves what is important. This will not happen unless the American people demand it. If parents and teachers, police officers and pastors, if hunters and sportsmen, if responsible gun owners, if Americans of every background stand up and say, enough; weve suffered too much pain and care too much about our children to allow this to continue -- then change will come. That's what it's going to take. In the letter that Julia wrote me, she said, I know that laws have to be passed by Congress, but I beg you to try very hard. Julia, I will try very hard. But shes right.  The most important changes we can make depend on congressional action. They need to bring these proposals up for a vote, and the American people need to make sure that they do. Get them on record. Ask your member of Congress if they support universal background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Ask them if they support renewing a ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And if they say no, ask them why not. Ask them whats more important -- doing whatever it takes to get a A grade from the gun lobby that funds their campaigns, or giving parents some peace of mind when they drop their child off for first grade?", "filename": "16January2013OnSigningExecutiveActionstoReduceGunViolence.txt"}, {"question": "That there is compassion, empathy and decency, and most of all, there is love.  Thats the Orlando that weve seen in recent days.  And that is the America that we have seen.   This afternoon, the Vice President and I had the opportunity to meet with many of the families here.  As you might imagine, their grief is beyond description.  Through their pain and through their tears, they told us about the joy that their loved ones had brought to their lives.  They talked about their sons or their daughters -- so many young people, in their 20s and 30s; so many students who were focused on the future.  One young woman was just 18 years old.  Another, said her father, was a happy girl with so many dreams.  There were siblings there talking about their brothers and their sisters and how they were role models that they looked up to.  There were husbands and wives who had taken a solemn vow; fathers and mothers who gave their full hearts to their children. These families could be our families.  In fact, they are our family -- theyre part of the American family.  Today, the Vice President and I told them, on behalf of the American people, that our hearts are broken, too, but we stand with you and that we are here for you, and that we are remembering those who you loved so deeply. As a nation, weve also been inspired by the courage of those who risked their lives and cared for others.  Partners whose last moments were spent shielding each other.  The mother who gave her life to save her son.  The former Marine whose quick thinking saved dozens of lives.  Joe and I had the chance to thank Mayor Dyer, Chief Mina, Sheriff Demings, all who responded in heroic ways; the outstanding police and first responders who were able to, through their professionalism and quick response, rescue so many people. We also owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all the doctors, all the nurses who have worked day and night to treat the injured, save lives and prevent even more anguish.  As one of the doctors here said, after the worst of humanity reared its ugly headthe best of humanity came roaring back.  Let me get that quote more precisely -- after the worst of humanity reared its evil headthe best of humanity came roaring back. Now, if were honest with ourselves, if, in fact, we want to show the best of our humanity, then we're all going to have to work together at every level of government, across political lines, to do more to stop killers who want to terrorize us.  We will continue to be relentless against terrorist groups like ISIL and al Qaeda.  We are going to destroy them.  We are going to disrupt their networks, and their financing, and the flow of fighters in and out of war theaters.  We're going to disrupt their propaganda that poisons so many minds around the world.  We're going to do all that.  Our resolve is clear.  But given the fact that the last two terrorist attacks on our soil -- Orlando and San Bernardino -- were homegrown, carried out it appears not by external plotters, not by vast networks or sophisticated cells, but by deranged individuals warped by the hateful propaganda that they had seen over the Internet, then were going to have to do more to prevent these kinds of events from occurring.  It's going to take more than just our military. It's going to require more than just our intelligence teams.  As good as they are, as dedicated as they are, as focused as they are, if you have lone wolf attacks like this, hatched in the minds of a disturbed person, then we're going to have to take different kinds of steps in order to prevent something like this from happening.     Those who were killed and injured here were gunned down by a single killer with a powerful assault weapon.  The motives of this killer may have been different than the mass shooters in Aurora or Newtown, but the instruments of death were so similar. And now, another 49 innocent people are dead.  Another 53 are injured.  Some are still fighting for their lives.  Some will have wounds that will last a lifetime.  We can't anticipate or catch every single deranged person that may wish to do harm to his neighbors, or his friends, or his coworkers, or strangers.  But we can do something about the amount of damage that they do. Unfortunately, our politics have conspired to make it as easy as possible for a terrorist or just a disturbed individual like those in Aurora and Newtown to buy extraordinarily powerful weapons -- and they can do so legally.  Today, once again, as has been true too many times before, I held and hugged grieving family members and parents, and they asked, why does this keep happening?", "filename": "16June2016AddresstotheCommunityofOrlandoFlorida.txt"}, {"question": "I have a very nice plane. I have a theme song. But what I enjoy most is having a chance to come to a school like Booker T. Washington High School and share this day with its graduates. So I could not be more pleased to be here. We've got some wonderful guests who are here as well, and I just want to make mention of them very quickly. First of all, the Governor of Tennessee, Bill Haslam, is here. Please give him a big round of applause. Three outstanding members of the Tennessee congressional delegation, all of whom care deeply about education -- Senator Bob Corker, Senator Lamar Alexander, and Congressman Steve Cohen is here. You've got one of Memphis's own, former Congressman Harold Ford, Jr. is in the house. And the Mayor of Memphis, A.C. Wharton is here. Please give him a big round of applause. I am so proud of each and every one of you. STUDENT: Thank you! THE PRESIDENT: You're welcome. You made it -- and not just through high school. You made it past Principal Kiner. I've spent a little bit of time with her now, and you can tell she is not messing around. I've only been in Memphis a couple of hours, but I'm pretty sure that if she told me to do something I'd do it. Then I had the chance to meet her mom and her daughter, Amber, a little while back, and we took a picture. It turns out Amber actually goes to another high school. She was worried that the boys would be afraid to talk to her if her mom was lurking in the hallways -- which is why my next job will be principal at Sasha and Malia's high school. And then I'll be president of their college. Let me also say to Alexis and Vashti -- I heard that you were a little nervous about speaking today, but now I'm a little nervous speaking after you, because you both did terrific jobs. We've had some great performances by Shalonda and Tecia and Paula, and the jazz band. Give them a big round of applause. Last but not least, I want to recognize all the people who helped you to reach this milestone: the parents, the grandparents, the aunts, the uncles, the sisters, the brothers, the friends, the neighbors -- who have loved you and stood behind you every step of the way. Congratulations, family. And I want to acknowledge the devoted teachers and administrators at Booker T. Washington, who believed in you -- who kept the heat on you, and have never treated teaching as a job, but rather as a calling. Every commencement is a day of celebration. I was just telling somebody backstage, I just love commencements. I get all choked up at commencements. So I can tell you already right now, I will cry at my children's commencement. I cry at other people's commencements. But this one is especially hopeful. This one is especially hopeful because some people say that schools like BTW just aren't supposed to succeed in America. You'll hear them say, \"The streets are too rough in those neighborhoods.\" \"The schools are too broken.\" \"The kids don't stand a chance.\" We are here today because every single one of you stood tall and said, \"Yes, we can.\" Yes, we can learn. Yes, we can succeed. You decided you would not be defined by where you come from but by where you want to go, by what you want to achieve, by the dreams you hope to fulfill. Just a couple of years ago, this was a school where only about half the students made it to graduation. For a long time, just a handful headed to college each year. But at Booker T. Washington, you changed all that. You created special academies for ninth graders to start students off on the right track. You made it possible for kids to take AP classes and earn college credits. You even had a team take part in robotics competition so students can learn with their hands by building and creating. And you didn't just create a new curriculum, you created a new culture -- a culture that prizes hard work and discipline; a culture that shows every student here that they matter and that their teachers believe in them. As Principal Kiner says, the kids have to know that you care, before they care what you know. And because you created this culture of caring and learning, today we're standing with a very different Booker T. Washington High School. Today, this is a place where more than four out of five students are earning a diploma; a place where 70 percent of the graduates will continue their education; where many will be the very first in their families to go to college. Today, Booker T. Washington is a place that has proven why we can't accept excuses -- any excuses -- when it comes to education. In the United States of America, we should never accept anything less than the best that our children have to offer. As your teacher Steve McKinney -- where's Steve at? There he is. AKA Big Mac. And I see why they call you Big Mac. As Mr. McKinney said in the local paper, \"We need everyone to broaden their ideas about what is possible. We need parents, politicians, and the media to see how success is possible, how success is happening every day.\" So that's why I came here today. Because if success can happen here at Booker T. Washington, it can happen anywhere in Memphis. And if it can happen in Memphis, it can happen anywhere in Tennessee. And it can happen anywhere in Tennessee, it can happen all across America. So ever since I became President, my administration has been working hard to make sure that we build on the progress that's taking place in schools like this. We've got to encourage the kind of change that's led not by politicians, not by Washington, D.C., but by teachers and principals and parents, and entire communities; by ordinary people standing up and demanding a better future for their children. We have more work to do so that every child can fulfill his or her God-given potential. And here in Tennessee we've been seeing great progress. Tennessee has been a leader, one of the first winners of the nationwide \"Race to the Top\" that we've launched to reward the kind of results you're getting here at Booker T. Washington. And understand, this isn't just an issue for me. I'm standing here as President because of the education that I received. As Chris said, my father left my family when I was two years old. And I was raised by a single mom, and sometimes she struggled to provide for me and my sister. But my mother, my grandparents, they pushed me to excel. They refused to let me make excuses. And they kept pushing me, especially on those rare occasions where I'd slack off or get into trouble. They weren't that rare, actually. I'm sure nobody here has done anything like that. I'm so blessed that they kept pushing; I'm so lucky that my teachers kept pushing -- because education made all the difference in my life. The same is true for Michelle. Education made such a difference in her life. Michelle's dad was a city worker, had multiple sclerosis, had to wake up every day and it took him a couple hours just to get ready for work. But he went to work every day. Her mom was a secretary, went to work every day, and kept on pushing her just like my folks pushed me. That's what's made a difference in our lives. And it's going to make an even greater difference in your lives -- not just for your own success but for the success of the United States of America. Because we live in a new world now. Used to be that you didn't have to have an education. If you were willing to work hard, you could go to a factory somewhere and get a job. Those times are passed. Believe it or not, when you go out there looking for a job, you're not just competing against people in Nashville or Atlanta. You're competing against young people in Beijing and Mumbai. That's some tough competition. Those kids are hungry. They're working hard. And you'll need to be prepared for it. And as a country, we need all of our young people to be ready. We can't just have some young people successful. We've got to have every young person contributing; earning those high school diplomas and then earning those college diplomas, or getting certified in a trade or profession. We can't succeed without it. Through education, you can also better yourselves in other ways. You learn how to learn -- how to think critically and find solutions to unexpected challenges. I remember we used to ask our teachers, \"Why am I going to need algebra?\" Well, you may not have to solve for x to get a good job or to be a good parent. But you will need to think through tough problems. You'll need to think on your feet. You'll need to know how to gather facts and evaluate information. So, math teachers, you can tell your students that the President says they need algebra. Education also teaches you the value of discipline -- that the greatest rewards come not from instant gratification but from sustained effort and from hard work. This is a lesson that's especially true today, in a culture that prizes flash over substance, that tells us that the goal in life is to be entertained, that says you can be famous just for being famous. You get on a reality show -- don't know what you've done -- suddenly you're famous. But that's not going to lead to lasting, sustained achievement. And finally, with the right education, both at home and at school, you can learn how to be a better human being. For when you read a great story or you learn about an important moment in history, it helps you imagine what it would be like to walk in somebody else's shoes, to know their struggles. The success of our economy will depend on your skills, but the success of our community will depend on your ability to follow the Golden Rule -- to treat others as you would like to be treated. We've seen how important this is even in the past few weeks, as communities here in Memphis and all across the South have come together to deal with floodwaters, and to help each other in the aftermath of terrible tornadoes. All of these qualities -- empathy, discipline, the capacity to solve problems, the capacity to think critically -- these skills don't just change how the world sees us. They change how we see ourselves. They allow each of us to seek out new horizons and new opportunities with confidence -- with the knowledge that we're ready; that we can face obstacles and challenges and unexpected setbacks. That's the power of your education. That's the power of the diploma that you receive today. And this is something that Booker T. Washington himself understood. Think about it. He entered this world a slave on a Southern plantation. But he would leave this world as the leader of a growing civil rights movement and the president of the world-famous Tuskegee Institute. The truth is, not a single one of the graduates here today has had it easy. Not a single one of you had anything handed to you on a silver platter. You had to work for it. You had to earn it. Most of all, you had to believe in yourselves. I think of Chris's stories, and what he's faced in his life: Lost his father to violence at the age of four. Had a childhood illness that could have been debilitating. But somehow he knew in his heart that he could take a different path. I think of all the graduates here who had to leave their homes when their apartments were torn down, but who took two buses each morning to come back to Booker T. Washington. I think of Eron Jackon. Where is Eron? Eron has known a lot of setbacks in her young life. There was a period when she lashed out and she got into trouble and she made mistakes. And when she first came to Booker T. Washington, she struggled. Is that right?", "filename": "16May2011CommencementSpeechatBookerT.WashingtonHS.txt"}, {"question": "Let me begin by thanking President Erdogan and the people of Antalya and Turkey for their outstanding work in hosting this G-20 Summit. Antalya is beautiful. The hospitality of the Turkish people is legendary. To our Turkish friends -- ok teekkrler [thank you so much].  I've been practicing that. At the G-20, our focus was on how to get the global economy growing faster and creating more jobs for our people. And Im pleased that we agreed that growth has to be inclusive to address the rising inequality around the world. Given growing cyber threats, we committed to a set of norms -- drafted by the United States -- for how governments should conduct themselves in cyberspace, including a commitment not to engage in the cyber theft of intellectual property for commercial gain. And as we head into global climate talks, all G-20 countries have submitted our targets, and weve pledged to work together for a successful outcome in Paris.

Across the world, in the United States, American flags are at half-staff in solidarity with our French allies. Were working closely with our French partners as they pursue their investigations and track down suspects. France is already a strong counterterrorism partner, and today were announcing a new agreement. Were streamlining the process by which we share intelligence and operational military information with France. This will allow our personnel to pass threat information, including on ISIL, to our French partners even more quickly and more often -- because we need to be doing everything we can to protect against more attacks and protect our citizens. Tragically, Paris is not alone. Weve seen outrageous attacks by ISIL in Beirut, last month in Ankara, routinely in Iraq. Here at the G-20, our nations have sent an unmistakable message that we are united against this threat. ISIL is the face of evil. Our goal, as Ive said many times, is to degrade and ultimately destroy this barbaric terrorist organization. As I outlined this fall at the United Nations, we have a comprehensive strategy using all elements of our power -- military, intelligence, economic, development, and the strength of our communities. With have always understood that this would be a long-term campaign. There will be setbacks and there will be successes. The terrible events in Paris were a terrible and sickening setback. Even as we grieve with our French friends, however, we cant lose sight that there has been progress being made. On the military front, our coalition is intensifying our airstrikes -- more than 8,000 to date. Were taking out ISIL leaders, commanders, their killers. Weve seen that when we have an effective partner on the ground, ISIL can and is pushed back. So local forces in Iraq, backed by coalition airpower, recently liberated Sinjar. Iraqi forces are fighting to take back Ramadi. In Syria, ISIL has been pushed back from much of the border region with Turkey. Weve stepped up our support of opposition forces who are working to cut off supply lines to ISILs strongholds in and around Raqqa. So, in short, both in Iraq and Syria, ISIL controls less territory than it did before. I made the point to my fellow leaders that if we want this progress to be sustained, more nations need to step up with the resources that this fight demands. Of course, the attacks in Paris remind us that it will not be enough to defeat ISIL in Syria and Iraq alone. Here in Antalya, our nations, therefore, committed to strengthening border controls, sharing more information, and stepping up our efforts to prevent the flow of foreign fighters in and out of Syria and Iraq. As the United States just showed in Libya, ISIL leaders will have no safe haven anywhere. And well continue to stand with leaders in Muslim communities, including faith leaders, who are the best voices to discredit ISILs warped ideology. On the humanitarian front, our nations agreed that we have to do even more, individually and collectively, to address the agony of the Syrian people. The United States is already the largest donor of humanitarian aid to the Syrian people -- some $4.5 billion in aid so far. As winter approaches, were donating additional supplies, including clothing and generators, through the United Nations. But the U.N. appeal for Syria still has less than half the funds needed. Today, Im again calling on more nations to contribute the resources that this crisis demands. In terms of refugees, its clear that countries like Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan -- which are already bearing an extraordinary burden -- cannot be expected to do so alone. At the same time, all of our countries have to ensure our security. And as President, my first priority is the safety of the American people. And thats why, even as we accept more refugees -- including Syrians -- we do so only after subjecting them to rigorous screening and security checks. We also have to remember that many of these refugees are the victims of terrorism themselves -- thats what theyre fleeing. Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values. Our nations can welcome refugees who are desperately seeking safety and ensure our own security. We can and must do both. Finally, weve begun to see some modest progress on the diplomatic front, which is critical because a political solution is the only way to end the war in Syria and unite the Syrian people and the world against ISIL. The Vienna talks mark the first time that all the key countries have come together -- as a result, I would add, of American leadership -- and reached a common understanding. With this weekends talks, theres a path forward -- negotiations between the Syrian opposition and the Syrian regime under the auspices of the United Nations; a transition toward a more inclusive, representative government; a new constitution, followed by free elections; and, alongside this political process, a ceasefire in the civil war, even as we continue to fight against ISIL. These are obviously ambitious goals. Hopes for diplomacy in Syria have been dashed before. There are any number of ways that this latest diplomatic push could falter. And there are still disagreements between the parties, including, most critically, over the fate of Bashar Assad, who we do not believe has a role in Syrias future because of his brutal rule. His war against the Syrian people is the primary root cause of this crisis. What is different this time, and what gives us some degree of hope, is that, as I said, for the first time, all the major countries on all sides of the Syrian conflict agree on a process that is needed to end this war. And so while we are very clear-eyed about the very, very difficult road still head, the United States, in partnership with our coalition, is going to remain relentless on all fronts -- military, humanitarian and diplomatic. We have the right strategy, and were going to see it through. So with that, I'm going to take some questions. And I will begin with Jerome Cartillier of AFP. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. One hundred and twenty-nine people were killed in Paris on Friday night. ISIL claimed responsibility for the massacre, sending the message that they could now target civilians all over the world. The equation has clearly changed. Isn't it time for your strategy to change? President Obama: Well, keep in mind what we have been doing. We have a military strategy that is putting enormous pressure on ISIL through airstrikes; that has put assistance and training on the ground with Iraqi forces; we're now working with Syrian forces as well to squeeze ISIL, cut off their supply lines. We've been coordinating internationally to reduce their financing capabilities, the oil that theyre trying to ship outside. We are taking strikes against high-value targets -- including, most recently, against the individual who was on the video executing civilians who had already been captured, as well as the head of ISIL in Libya. So it's not just in Iraq and Syria. And so, on the military front, we are continuing to accelerate what we do. As we find additional partners on the ground that are effective, we work with them more closely. Ive already authorized additional Special Forces on the ground who are going to be able to improve that coordination. On the counterterrorism front, keep in mind that since I came into office, we have been worried about these kinds of attacks. The vigilance that the United States government maintains and the cooperation that were consistently expanding with our European and other partners in going after every single terrorist network is robust and constant. And every few weeks, I meet with my entire national security team and we go over every single threat stream that is presented, and where we have relevant information, we share it immediately with our counterparts around the world, including our European partners. On aviation security, we have, over the last several years, been working so that at various airports sites -- not just in the United States, but overseas -- we are strengthening our mechanisms to screen and discover passengers who should not be boarding flights, and improving the matters in which we are screening luggage that is going onboard. And on the diplomatic front, weve been consistently working to try to get all the parties together to recognize that there is a moderate opposition inside of Syria that can form the basis for a transition government, and to reach out not only to our friends but also to the Russians and the Iranians who are on the other side of this equation to explain to them that ultimately an organization like ISIL is the greatest danger to them, as well as to us. So there will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward, but the strategy that we are putting forward is the strategy that ultimately is going to work. But as I said from the start, its going to take time. And whats been interesting is, in the aftermath of Paris, as I listen to those who suggest something else needs to be done, typically the things they suggest need to be done are things we are already doing. The one exception is that there have been a few who suggested that we should put large numbers of U.S. troops on the ground. And keep in mind that we have the finest military in the world and we have the finest military minds in the world, and Ive been meeting with them intensively for years now, discussing these various options, and it is not just my view but the view of my closest military and civilian advisors that that would be a mistake -- not because our military could not march into Mosul or Raqqa or Ramadi and temporarily clear out ISIL, but because we would see a repetition of what weve seen before, which is, if you do not have local populations that are committed to inclusive governance and who are pushing back against ideological extremes, that they resurface -- unless were prepared to have a permanent occupation of these countries. And lets assume that we were to send 50,000 troops into Syria. What happens when theres a terrorist attack generated from Yemen? Do we then send more troops into there? Or Libya, perhaps? Or if theres a terrorist network thats operating anywhere else -- in North Africa, or in Southeast Asia? So a strategy has to be one that can be sustained. And the strategy that were pursuing, which focuses on going after targets, limiting wherever possible the capabilities of ISIL on the ground -- systematically going after their leadership, their infrastructure, strengthening Shia -- or strengthening Syrian and Iraqi forces and Kurdish forces that are prepared to fight them, cutting off their borders and squeezing the space in which they can operate until ultimately were able to defeat them -- thats the strategy were going to have to pursue. And we will continue to generate more partners for that strategy. And there are going to be some things that we try that dont work; there will be some strategies we try that do work. And when we find strategies that work, we will double down on those. Margaret Brennan, CBS. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. A more than year-long bombing campaign in Iraq and in Syria has failed to contain the ambition and the ability of ISIS to launch attacks in the West. Have you underestimated their abilities? And will you widen the rules of engagement for U.S. forces to take more aggressive action? President Obama: No, we haven't underestimated our abilities. This is precisely why were in Iraq as we speak, and why were operating in Syria as we speak. And its precisely why we have mobilized 65 countries to go after ISIL, and why I hosted at the United Nations an entire discussion of counterterrorism strategies and curbing the flow of foreign fighters, and why weve been putting pressure on those countries that have not been as robust as they need to in tracking the flow of foreign fighters in and out of Syria and Iraq. And so there has been an acute awareness on the part of my administration from the start that it is possible for an organization like ISIL that has such a twisted ideology, and has shown such extraordinary brutality and complete disregard for innocent lives, that they would have the capabilities to potentially strike in the West. And because thousands of fighters have flowed from the West and are European citizens -- a few hundred from the United States, but far more from Europe -- that when those foreign fighters returned, it posed a significant danger. And we have consistently worked with our European partners, disrupting plots in some cases. Sadly, this one was not disrupted in time. But understand that one of the challenges we have in this situation is, is that if you have a handful of people who dont mind dying, they can kill a lot of people. Thats one of the challenges of terrorism. Its not their sophistication or the particular weapon that they possess, but it is the ideology that they carry with them and their willingness to die. And in those circumstances, tracking each individual, making sure that we are disrupting and preventing these attacks is a constant effort at vigilance, and requires extraordinary coordination. Now, part of the reason that it is important what we do in Iraq and Syria is that the narrative that ISIL developed of creating this caliphate makes it more attractive to potential recruits. So when I said that we are containing their spread in Iraq and Syria, in fact, they control less territory than they did last year. And the more we shrink that territory, the less they can pretend that they are somehow a functioning state, and the more it becomes apparent that they are simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations. That allows us to reduce the flow of foreign fighters, which then, over time, will lessen the numbers of terrorists who can potentially carry out terrible acts like they did in Paris. And thats what we did with al Qaeda. That doesnt mean, by the way, that al Qaeda no longer possess the capabilities of potentially striking the West. Al Qaeda in the Peninsula that operates primarily in Yemen we know has consistently tried to target the West. And we are consistently working to disrupt those acts. But despite the fact that they have not gotten as much attention as ISIL, they still pose a danger, as well. And so our goals here consistently have to be to be aggressive, and to leave no stone unturned, but also recognize this is not conventional warfare. We play into the ISIL narrative when we act as if theyre a state, and we use routine military tactics that are designed to fight a state that is attacking another state. Thats not whats going on here. These are killers with fantasies of glory who are very savvy when it comes to social media, and are able to infiltrate the minds of not just Iraqis or Syrians, but disaffected individuals around the world. And when they activate those individuals, those individuals can do a lot of damage. And so we have to take the approach of being rigorous on our counterterrorism efforts, and consistently improve and figure out how we can get more information, how we can infiltrate these networks, how we can reduce their operational space, even as we also try to shrink the amount of territory they control to defeat their narrative. Ultimately, to reclaim territory from them is going to require, however, an ending of the Syrian civil war, which is why the diplomatic efforts are so important. And its going to require an effective Iraqi effort that bridges Shia and Sunni differences, which is why our diplomatic efforts inside of Iraq are so important, as well. Jim Avila. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. In the days and weeks before the Paris attacks, did you receive warning in your daily intelligence briefing that an attack was imminent? If not, does that not call into question the current assessment that there is no immediate, specific, credible threat to the United States today? And secondly, if I could ask you to address your critics who say that your reluctance to enter another Middle East war, and your preference of diplomacy over using the military makes the United States weaker and emboldens our enemies. President Obama: Jim, every day we have threat streams coming through the intelligence transit. And as I said, every several weeks we sit down with all my national security, intelligence, and military teams to discuss various threat streams that may be generated. And the concerns about potential ISIL attacks in the West have been there for over a year now, and they come through periodically. There were no specific mentions of this particular attack that would give us a sense of something that we need -- that we could provide French authorities, for example, or act on ourselves. But typically the way the intelligence works is there will be a threat stream that is from one source, how reliable is that source; perhaps some signal intelligence gets picked up, its evaluated. Some of it is extraordinarily vague and unspecific, and theres no clear timetable. Some of it may be more specific, and then folks chase down that threat to see what happens. I am not aware of anything that was specific in the sense -- that would have given a premonition about a particular action in Paris that would allow for law enforcement or military actions to disrupt it. With respect to the broader issue of my critics, to some degree I answered the question earlier. I think that when you listen to what they actually have to say, what theyre proposing, most of the time, when pressed, they describe things that were already doing. Maybe theyre not aware that were already doing them. Some of them seem to think that if I were just more bellicose in expressing what were doing, that that would make a difference -- because that seems to be the only thing that theyre doing, is talking as if theyre tough. But I haven't seen particular strategies that they would suggest that would make a real difference. Now, there are a few exceptions. And as I said, the primary exception is those who would deploy U.S. troops on a large scale to retake territory either in Iraq or now in Syria. And at least they have the honesty to go ahead and say thats what they would do. I just addressed why I think theyre wrong. There have been some who are well-meaning, and I dont doubt their sincerity when it comes to the issue of the dire humanitarian situation in Syria, who, for example, call for a no-fly zone or a safe zone of some sort. And this is an example of the kind of issue where I will sit down with our top military and intelligence advisors, and we will painstakingly go through what does something like that look like. And typically, after weve gone through a lot of planning and a lot of discussion, and really working it through, it is determined that it would be counterproductive to take those steps -- in part because ISIL does not have planes, so the attacks are on the ground. A true safe zone requires us to set up ground operations. And the bulk of the deaths that have occurred in Syria, for example, have come about not because of regime bombing, but because of on-the-ground casualties. Who would come in, who could come out of that safe zone; how would it work; would it become a magnet for further terrorist attacks; and how many personnel would be required, and how would it end -- theres a whole set of questions that have to be answered there. I guess my point is this, Jim: My only interest is to end suffering and to keep the American people safe. And if theres a good idea out there, then were going to do it. I dont think Ive shown hesitation to act -- whether its with respect to bin Laden or with respect to sending additional troops in Afghanistan, or keeping them there -- if it is determined that its actually going to work. But what we do not do, what I do not do is to take actions either because it is going to work politically or it is going to somehow, in the abstract, make America look tough, or make me look tough. And maybe part of the reason is because every few months I go to Walter Reed, and I see a 25-year-old kid whos paralyzed or has lost his limbs, and some of those are people Ive ordered into battle. And so I cant afford to play some of the political games that others may. We'll do whats required to keep the American people safe. And I think it's entirely appropriate in a democracy to have a serious debate about these issues. If folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan. If they think that somehow their advisors are better than the Chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them. And we can have that debate. But what I'm not interested in doing is posing or pursuing some notion of American leadership or America winning, or whatever other slogans they come up with that has no relationship to what is actually going to work to protect the American people, and to protect people in the region who are getting killed, and to protect our allies and people like France. I'm too busy for that. Jim Acosta. Question: Thank you very much, Mr. President. I wanted to go back to something that you said to Margaret earlier when you said that you have not underestimated ISISs abilities. This is an organization that you once described as a JV team that evolved into a force that has now occupied territory in Iraq and Syria and is now able to use that safe haven to launch attacks in other parts of the world. How is that not underestimating their capabilities? And how is that contained, quite frankly? And I think a lot of Americans have this frustration that they see that the United States has the greatest military in the world, it has the backing of nearly every other country in the world when it comes to taking on ISIS. I guess the question is -- and if youll forgive the language -- is why can't we take out these bastards? President Obama: Well, Jim, I just spent the last three questions answering that very question, so I don't know what more you want me to add. I think I've described very specifically what our strategy is, and I've described very specifically why we do not pursue some of the other strategies that have been suggested. This is not, as I said, a traditional military opponent. We can retake territory. And as long as we leave our troops there, we can hold it, but that does not solve the underlying problem of eliminating the dynamics that are producing these kinds of violent extremist groups. And so we are going to continue to pursue the strategy that has the best chance of working, even though it does not offer the satisfaction, I guess, of a neat headline or an immediate resolution. And part of the reason, as I said, Jim, is because there are costs to the other side. I just want to remind people, this is not an abstraction. When we send troops in, those troops get injured, they get killed; theyre away from their families; our country spends hundreds of billions of dollars. And so given the fact that there are enormous sacrifices involved in any military action, it's best that we don't shoot first and aim later. It's important for us to get the strategy right. And the strategy that we are pursuing is the right one. Ron Allen. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. I think a lot of people around the world and in America are concerned because given the strategy that youre pursuing -- and its been more than a year now -- ISISs capabilities seem to be expanding. Were you aware that they had the capability of pulling off the kind of attack that they did in Paris? Are you concerned? And do you think they have that same capability to strike in the United States? And do you think that given all youve learned about ISIS over the past year or so, and given all the criticism about your underestimating them, do you think you really understand this enemy well enough to defeat them and to protect the homeland? President Obama: All right, so this is another variation on the same question. And I guess -- let me try it one last time. We have been fully aware of the potential capabilities of them carrying out a terrorist attack. Thats precisely why we have been mounting a very aggressive strategy to go after them. As I said before, when youre talking about the ability of a handful of people with not wildly sophisticated military equipment, weapons, who are willing to die, they can kill a lot of people. And preventing them from doing so is challenging for every country. And if there was a swift and quick solution to this, I assure you that not just the United States, but France and Turkey, and others who have been subject to these terrorist attacks would have implemented those strategies. There are certain advantages that the United States has in preventing these kinds of attacks. Obviously, after 9/11, we hardened the homeland, set up a whole series of additional steps to protect aviation, to apply lessons learned. Weve seen much better cooperation between the FBI, state governments, local governments. There is some advantages to geography with respect to the United States. But, having said that, weve seen the possibility of terrorist attacks on our soil. There was the Boston Marathon bombers. Obviously, it did not result in the scale of death that we saw in Paris, but that was a serious attempt at killing a lot of people by two brothers and a crockpot. And it gives you some sense of, I think, the kinds of challenges that are going to be involved in this going forward. So again, ISIL has serious capabilities. Its capabilities are not unique. They are capabilities that other terrorist organizations that we track and are paying attention to possess, as well. We are going after all of them. What is unique about ISIL is the degree to which it has been able to control territory that then allows them to attract additional recruits, and the greater effectiveness that they have on social media and their ability to use that to not only attract recruits to fight in Syria, but also potentially to carry out attacks in the homeland and in Europe and in other parts of the world. And so our ability to shrink the space in which they can operate, combined with a resolution to the Syria situation -- which will reduce the freedom with which they feel that they can operate, and getting local forces who are able to hold and keep them out over the long term, that ultimately is going to be whats going to make a difference. And its going to take some time, but its not something that at any stage in this process have we not been aware needs to be done. Question: [Off-mic] -- Mr. President? President Obama: Okay, go ahead. Question: Should I wait for the microphone? President Obama: No, I can hear you. Question: Okay, thank you so much. [Inaudible.] I want to ask a question [inaudible]. These terrorist attacks weve seen allegedly have been attacks under the name of Islam. But this really takes -- or upsets the peaceful people like countries like Turkey. So how can we give off that [inaudible] this is not really representative of Muslims?", "filename": "16November2015G20PressConferenceinAntalyaTurkey.txt"}, {"question": "Praise be to God. Let me begin by thanking the entire Vermont Avenue Baptist Church family for welcoming our family here today. It feels like a family. Thank you for making us feel that way. To Pastor Wheeler, first lady Wheeler, thank you so much for welcoming us here today. Congratulations on Jordan Denice -- aka Cornelia.\rMichelle and I have been blessed with a new nephew this year as well -- Austin Lucas Robinson. So maybe at the appropriate time we can make introductions. Now, if Jordan's father is like me, then that will be in about 30 years. That is a great blessing.\rMichelle and Malia and Sasha and I are thrilled to be here today. And I know that sometimes you have to go through a little fuss to have me as a guest speaker. So let me apologize in advance for all the fuss.\rWe gather here, on a Sabbath, during a time of profound difficulty for our nation and for our world. In such a time, it soothes the soul to seek out the Divine in a spirit of prayer; to seek solace among a community of believers. But we are not here just to ask the Lord for His blessing. We aren't here just to interpret His Scripture. We're also here to call on the memory of one of His noble servants, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\r \rNow, it's fitting that we do so here, within the four walls of Vermont Avenue Baptist Church -- here, in a church that rose like the phoenix from the ashes of the civil war; here in a church formed by freed slaves, whose founding pastor had worn the union blue; here in a church from whose pews congregants set out for marches and from whom choir anthems of freedom were heard; from whose sanctuary King himself would sermonize from time to time.\rOne of those times was Thursday, December 6, 1956. Pastor, you said you were a little older than me, so were you around at that point? You were three years old -- okay. I wasnt born yet.\rOn Thursday, December 6, 1956. And before Dr. King had pointed us to the mountaintop, before he told us about his dream in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King came here, as a 27- year-old preacher, to speak on what he called \"The Challenge of a New Age.\" \"The Challenge of a New Age.\" It was a period of triumph, but also uncertainty, for Dr. King and his followers -- because just weeks earlier, the Supreme Court had ordered the desegregation of Montgomery's buses, a hard-wrought, hard-fought victory that would put an end to the 381- day historic boycott down in Montgomery, Alabama.\rAnd yet, as Dr. King rose to take that pulpit, the future still seemed daunting. It wasn't clear what would come next for the movement that Dr. King led. It wasn't clear how we were going to reach the Promised Land. Because segregation was still rife; lynchings still a fact. Yes, the Supreme Court had ruled not only on the Montgomery buses, but also on Brown v. Board of Education. And yet that ruling was defied throughout the South -- by schools and by states; they ignored it with impunity. And here in the nation's capital, the federal government had yet to fully align itself with the laws on its books and the ideals of its founding.\rSo it's not hard for us, then, to imagine that moment. We can imagine folks coming to this church, happy about the boycott being over. We can also imagine them, though, coming here concerned about their future, sometimes second-guessing strategy, maybe fighting off some creeping doubts, perhaps despairing about whether the movement in which they had placed so many of their hopes -- a movement in which they believed so deeply -- could actually deliver on its promise.\rSo here we are, more than half a century later, once again facing the challenges of a new age. Here we are, once more marching toward an unknown future, what I call the Joshua generation to their Moses generation -- the great inheritors of progress paid for with sweat and blood, and sometimes life itself.\rWe've inherited the progress of unjust laws that are now overturned. We take for granted the progress of a ballot being available to anybody who wants to take the time to actually vote. We enjoy the fruits of prejudice and bigotry being lifted -- slowly, sometimes in fits and starts, but irrevocably -- from human hearts. It's that progress that made it possible for me to be here today; for the good people of this country to elect an African American the 44th President of the United States of America.\r\rReverend Wheeler mentioned the inauguration, last year's election. You know, on the heels of that victory over a year ago, there were some who suggested that somehow we had entered into a post-racial America, all those problems would be solved. There were those who argued that because I had spoke of a need for unity in this country that our nation was somehow entering into a period of post-partisanship. That didnt work out so well. There was a hope shared by many that life would be better from the moment that I swore that oath.\rOf course, as we meet here today, one year later, we know the promise of that moment has not yet been fully fulfilled. Because of an era of greed and irresponsibility that sowed the seeds of its own demise, because of persistent economic troubles unaddressed through the generations, because of a banking crisis that brought the financial system to the brink of catastrophe, we are being tested -- in our own lives and as a nation -- as few have been tested before.\rUnemployment is at its highest level in more than a quarter of a century. Nowhere is it higher than the African American community. Poverty is on the rise. Home ownership is slipping. Beyond our shores, our sons and daughters are fighting two wars. Closer to home, our Haitian brothers and sisters are in desperate need. Bruised, battered, many people are legitimately feeling doubt, even despair, about the future. Like those who came to this church on that Thursday in 1956, folks are wondering, where do we go from here?\rI understand those feelings. I understand the frustration and sometimes anger that so many folks feel as they struggle to stay afloat. I get letters from folks around the country every day; I read 10 a night out of the 40,000 that we receive. And there are stories of hardship and desperation, in some cases, pleading for help: I need a job. I'm about to lose my home. I don't have health care -- it's about to cause my family to be bankrupt. Sometimes you get letters from children: My mama or my daddy have lost their jobs, is there something you can do to help? Ten letters like that a day we read.\rSo, yes, we're passing through a hard winter. It's the hardest in some time. But let's always remember that, as a people, the American people, we've weathered some hard winters before. This country was founded during some harsh winters. The fishermen, the laborers, the craftsmen who made camp at Valley Forge -- they weathered a hard winter. The slaves and the freedmen who rode an underground railroad, seeking the light of justice under the cover of night -- they weathered a hard winter. The seamstress whose feet were tired, the pastor whose voice echoes through the ages -- they weathered some hard winters. It was for them, as it is for us, difficult, in the dead of winter, to sometimes see spring coming. They, too, sometimes felt their hopes deflate. And yet, each season, the frost melts, the cold recedes, the sun reappears. So it was for earlier generations and so it will be for us.\rWhat we need to do is to just ask what lessons we can learn from those earlier generations about how they sustained themselves during those hard winters, how they persevered and prevailed. Let us in this Joshua generation learn how that Moses generation overcame.\r\rLet me offer a few thoughts on this. First and foremost, they did so by remaining firm in their resolve. Despite being threatened by sniper fire or planted bombs, by shoving and punching and spitting and angry stares, they adhered to that sweet spirit of resistance, the principles of nonviolence that had accounted for their success.\rSecond, they understood that as much as our government and our political parties had betrayed them in the past -- as much as our nation itself had betrayed its own ideals -- government, if aligned with the interests of its people, can be -- and must be -- a force for good. So they stayed on the Justice Department. They went into the courts. They pressured Congress, they pressured their President. They didnt give up on this country. They didnt give up on government. They didnt somehow say government was the problem; they said, we're going to change government, we're going to make it better. Imperfect as it was, they continued to believe in the promise of democracy; in America's constant ability to remake itself, to perfect this union.\rThird, our predecessors were never so consumed with theoretical debates that they couldn't see progress when it came. Sometimes I get a little frustrated when folks just don't want to see that even if we don't get everything, we're getting something. King understood that the desegregation of the Armed Forces didnt end the civil rights movement, because black and white soldiers still couldn't sit together at the same lunch counter when they came home. But he still insisted on the rightness of desegregating the Armed Forces. That was a good first step -- even as he called for more. He didnt suggest that somehow by the signing of the Civil Rights that somehow all discrimination would end. But he also didnt think that we shouldnt sign the Civil Rights Act because it hasnt solved every problem. Let's take a victory, he said, and then keep on marching. Forward steps, large and small, were recognized for what they were -- which was progress.\rFourth, at the core of King's success was an appeal to conscience that touched hearts and opened minds, a commitment to universal ideals -- of freedom, of justice, of equality -- that spoke to all people, not just some people. For King understood that without broad support, any movement for civil rights could not be sustained. That's why he marched with the white auto worker in Detroit. That's why he linked arm with the Mexican farm worker in California, and united people of all colors in the noble quest for freedom.\rOf course, King overcame in other ways as well. He remained strategically focused on gaining ground -- his eyes on the prize constantly -- understanding that change would not be easy, understand that change wouldn't come overnight, understanding that there would be setbacks and false starts along the way, but understanding, as he said in 1956, that \"we can walk and never get weary, because we know there is a great camp meeting in the promised land of freedom and justice.\"\r\rAnd it's because the Moses generation overcame that the trials we face today are very different from the ones that tested us in previous generations. Even after the worst recession in generations, life in America is not even close to being as brutal as it was back then for so many. That's the legacy of Dr. King and his movement. That's our inheritance. Having said that, let there be no doubt the challenges of our new age are serious in their own right, and we must face them as squarely as they faced the challenges they saw.\rI know it's been a hard road we've traveled this year to rescue the economy, but the economy is growing again. The job losses have finally slowed, and around the country, there's signs that businesses and families are beginning to rebound. We are making progress.\rI know it's been a hard road that we've traveled to reach this point on health reform. I promise you I know. But under the legislation I will sign into law, insurance companies won't be able to drop you when you get sick, and more than 30 million people -- our fellow Americans will finally have insurance. More than 30 million men and women and children, mothers and fathers, won't be worried about what might happen to them if they get sick. This will be a victory not for Democrats; this will be a victory for dignity and decency, for our common humanity. This will be a victory for the United States of America.\rLet's work to change the political system, as imperfect as it is. I know people can feel down about the way things are going sometimes here in Washington. I know it's tempting to give up on the political process. But we've put in place tougher rules on lobbying and ethics and transparency -- tougher rules than any administration in history. It's not enough, but it's progress. Progress is possible. Don't give up on voting. Don't give up on advocacy. Don't give up on activism. There are too many needs to be met, too much work to be done. Like Dr. King said, \"We must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope.\"\rLet us broaden our coalition, building a confederation not of liberals or conservatives, not of red states or blue states, but of all Americans who are hurting today, and searching for a better tomorrow. The urgency of the hour demands that we make common cause with all of America's workers -- white, black, brown -- all of whom are being hammered by this recession, all of whom are yearning for that spring to come. It demands that we reach out to those who've been left out in the cold even when the economy is good, even when we're not in recession -- the youth in the inner cities, the youth here in Washington, D.C., people in rural communities who haven't seen prosperity reach them for a very long time. It demands that we fight discrimination, whatever form it may come. That means we fight discrimination against gays and lesbians, and we make common cause to reform our immigration system.\rAnd finally, we have to recognize, as Dr. King did, that progress can't just come from without -- it also has to come from within. And over the past year, for example, we've made meaningful improvements in the field of education. I've got a terrific Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. He's been working hard with states and working hard with the D.C. school district, and we've insisted on reform, and we've insisted on accountability.\r\rWe we're putting in more money and we've provided more Pell Grants and more tuition tax credits and simpler financial aid forms. We've done all that, but parents still need to parent. Kids still need to own up to their responsibilities. We still have to set high expectations for our young people. Folks can't simply look to government for all the answers without also looking inside themselves, inside their own homes, for some of the answers.\rProgress will only come if we're willing to promote that ethic of hard work, a sense of responsibility, in our own lives. I'm not talking, by the way, just to the African American community. Sometimes when I say these things people assme, well, he's just talking to black people about working hard. No, no, no, no. I'm talking to the American community. Because somewhere along the way, we, as a nation, began to lose touch with some of our core values. You know what I'm talking about. We became enraptured with the false prophets who prophesized an easy path to success, paved with credit cards and home equity loans and get- rich-quick schemes, and the most important thing was to be a celebrity; it doesnt matter what you do, as long as you get on TV. That's everybody.\rWe forgot what made the bus boycott a success; what made the civil rights movement a success; what made the United States of America a success -- that, in this country, there's no substitute for hard work, no substitute for a job well done, no substitute for being responsible stewards of God's blessings.\rWhat we're called to do, then, is rebuild America from its foundation on up. To reinvest in the essentials that we've neglected for too long -- like health care, like education, like a better energy policy, like basic infrastructure, like scientific research. Our generation is called to buckle down and get back to basics.\rWe must do so not only for ourselves, but also for our children, and their children. For Jordan and for Austin. That's a sacrifice that falls on us to make. It's a much smaller sacrifice than the Moses generation had to make, but it's still a sacrifice.\rYes, it's hard to transition to a clean energy economy. Sometimes it may be inconvenient, but it's a sacrifice that we have to make. It's hard to be fiscally responsible when we have all these human needs, and we're inheriting enormous deficits and debt, but that's a sacrifice that we're going to have to make. You know, it's easy, after a hard day's work, to just put your kid in front of the TV set -- you're tired, don't want to fuss with them -- instead of reading to them, but that's a sacrifice we must joyfully accept.\rSometimes it's hard to be a good father and good mother. Sometimes it's hard to be a good neighbor, or a good citizen, to give up time in service of others, to give something of ourselves to a cause that's greater than ourselves -- as Michelle and I are urging folks to do tomorrow to honor and celebrate Dr. King. But these are sacrifices that we are called to make. These are sacrifices that our faith calls us to make. Our faith in the future. Our faith in America. Our faith in God.\r\rAnd on his sermon all those years ago, Dr. King quoted a poet's verse:\rTruth forever on the scaffold\rWrong forever on the throne...\rAnd behind the dim unknown stands God\rWithin the shadows keeping watch above his own.\rEven as Dr. King stood in this church, a victory in the past and uncertainty in the future, he trusted God. He trusted that God would make a way. A way for prayers to be answered. A way for our union to be perfected. A way for the arc of the moral universe, no matter how long, to slowly bend towards truth and bend towards freedom, to bend towards justice. He had faith that God would make a way out of no way.\rYou know, folks ask me sometimes why I look so calm. They say, all this stuff coming at you, how come you just seem calm?", "filename": "17 January 2010  Martin Luther King Remembrance Speech.txt"}, {"question": "Families that know unspeakable grief summoned the courage to petition their elected leaders -- not just to honor the memory of their children, but to protect the lives of all our children.  And a few minutes ago, a minority in the United States Senate decided it wasnt worth it.  They blocked common-sense gun reforms even while these families looked on from the Senate gallery. By now, its well known that 90 percent of the American people support universal background checks that make it harder for a dangerous person to buy a gun.  Were talking about convicted felons, people convicted of domestic violence, people with a severe mental illness.  Ninety percent of Americans support that idea.  Most Americans think that's already the law. And a few minutes ago, 90 percent of Democrats in the Senate just voted for that idea.  But its not going to happen because 90 percent of Republicans in the Senate just voted against that idea. A majority of senators voted \"yes\" to protecting more of our citizens with smarter background checks.  But by this continuing distortion of Senate rules, a minority was able to block it from moving forward. Im going to speak plainly and honestly about whats happened here because the American people are trying to figure out how can something have 90 percent support and yet not happen. We had a Democrat and a Republican -- both gun owners, both fierce defenders of our Second Amendment, with A grades from the NRA -- come together and worked together to write a common-sense compromise on background checks.  And I want to thank Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey for their courage in doing that.  That was not easy given their traditional strong support for Second Amendment rights. As they said, nobody could honestly claim that the package they put together infringed on our Second Amendment rights.  All it did was extend the same background check rules that already apply to guns purchased from a dealer to guns purchased at gun shows or over the Internet.  So 60 percent of guns are already purchased through a background check system; this would have covered a lot of the guns that are currently outside that system. Their legislation showed respect for gun owners, and it showed respect for the victims of gun violence.  And Gabby Giffords, by the way, is both -- shes a gun owner and a victim of gun violence.  She is a Westerner and a moderate.  And she supports these background checks. In fact, even the NRA used to support expanded background checks.  The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks.  So while this compromise didnt contain everything I wanted or everything that these families wanted, it did represent progress.  It represented moderation and common sense.  Thats why 90 percent of the American people supported it. But instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill.  They claimed that it would create some sort of \"big brother\" gun registry, even though the bill did the opposite.  This legislation, in fact, outlawed any registry.  Plain and simple, right there in the text.  But that didnt matter. And unfortunately, this pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators.  And I talked to several of these senators over the past few weeks, and theyre all good people.  I know all of them were shocked by tragedies like Newtown.  And I also understand that they come from states that are strongly pro-gun. And I have consistently said that there are regional differences when it comes to guns, and that both sides have to listen to each other. But the fact is most of these senators could not offer any good reason why we wouldnt want to make it harder for criminals and those with severe mental illnesses to buy a gun.  There were no coherent arguments as to why we wouldnt do this.  It came down to politics -- the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections.  They worried that the gun lobby would spend a lot of money and paint them as anti-Second Amendment. And obviously, a lot of Republicans had that fear, but Democrats had that fear, too.  And so they caved to the pressure, and they started looking for an excuse -- any excuse -- to vote \"no.\" One common argument I heard was that this legislation wouldnt prevent all future massacres.  And thats true.  As I said from the start, no single piece of legislation can stop every act of violence and evil.  We learned that tragically just two days ago.  But if action by Congress could have saved one person, one child, a few hundred, a few thousand -- if it could have prevented those people from losing their lives to gun violence in the future while preserving our Second Amendment rights, we had an obligation to try. And this legislation met that test.  And too many senators failed theirs. I've heard some say that blocking this step would be a victory.  And my question is, a victory for who?  A victory for what?  All that happened today was the preservation of the loophole that lets dangerous criminals buy guns without a background check.  That didnt make our kids safer.  Victory for not doing something that 90 percent of Americans, 80 percent of Republicans, the vast majority of your constituents wanted to get done?  It begs the question, who are we here to represent? I've heard folks say that having the families of victims lobby for this legislation was somehow misplaced.  \"A prop,\" somebody called them.  \"Emotional blackmail,\" some outlet said.  Are they serious?  Do we really think that thousands of families whose lives have been shattered by gun violence dont have a right to weigh in on this issue?  Do we think their emotions, their loss is not relevant to this debate?", "filename": "17April2013OnSenateVoteAgainstBackgroundCheckGunAmendment.txt"}, {"question": "Throughout American history, intelligence has helped secure our country and our freedoms.  In the Civil War, Union balloon reconnaissance tracked the size of Confederate armies by counting the number of campfires.  In World War II, code-breakers gave us insights into Japanese war plans, and when Patton marched across Europe, intercepted communications helped save the lives of his troops.  After the war, the rise of the Iron Curtain and nuclear weapons only increased the need for sustained intelligence gathering.  And so, in the early days of the Cold War, President Truman created the National Security Agency, or NSA, to give us insights into the Soviet bloc, and provide our leaders with information they needed to confront aggression and avert catastrophe. Throughout this evolution, we benefited from both our Constitution and our traditions of limited government.  U.S. intelligence agencies were anchored in a system of checks and balances -- with oversight from elected leaders, and protections for ordinary citizens.  Meanwhile, totalitarian states like East Germany offered a cautionary tale of what could happen when vast, unchecked surveillance turned citizens into informers, and persecuted people for what they said in the privacy of their own homes. In fact, even the United States proved not to be immune to the abuse of surveillance.  And in the 1960s, government spied on civil rights leaders and critics of the Vietnam War.  And partly in response to these revelations, additional laws were established in the 1970s to ensure that our intelligence capabilities could not be misused against our citizens.  In the long, twilight struggle against Communism, we had been reminded that the very liberties that we sought to preserve could not be sacrificed at the altar of national security. If the fall of the Soviet Union left America without a competing superpower, emerging threats from terrorist groups, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction placed new and in some ways more complicated demands on our intelligence agencies.  Globalization and the Internet made these threats more acute, as technology erased borders and empowered individuals to project great violence, as well as great good.  Moreover, these new threats raised new legal and new policy questions.  For while few doubted the legitimacy of spying on hostile states, our framework of laws was not fully adapted to prevent terrorist attacks by individuals acting on their own, or acting in small, ideologically driven groups on behalf of a foreign power. The horror of September 11th brought all these issues to the fore.  Across the political spectrum, Americans recognized that we had to adapt to a world in which a bomb could be built in a basement, and our electric grid could be shut down by operators an ocean away.  We were shaken by the signs we had missed leading up to the attacks -- how the hijackers had made phone calls to known extremists and traveled to suspicious places.  So we demanded that our intelligence community improve its capabilities, and that law enforcement change practices to focus more on preventing attacks before they happen than prosecuting terrorists after an attack. It is hard to overstate the transformation Americas intelligence community had to go through after 9/11.  Our agencies suddenly needed to do far more than the traditional mission of monitoring hostile powers and gathering information for policymakers.  Instead, they were now asked to identify and target plotters in some of the most remote parts of the world, and to anticipate the actions of networks that, by their very nature, cannot be easily penetrated with spies or informants. And it is a testimony to the hard work and dedication of the men and women of our intelligence community that over the past decade weve made enormous strides in fulfilling this mission.  Today, new capabilities allow intelligence agencies to track who a terrorist is in contact with, and follow the trail of his travel or his funding.  New laws allow information to be collected and shared more quickly and effectively between federal agencies, and state and local law enforcement.  Relationships with foreign intelligence services have expanded, and our capacity to repel cyber-attacks have been strengthened.  And taken together, these efforts have prevented multiple attacks and saved innocent lives -- not just here in the United States, but around the globe. And yet, in our rush to respond to a very real and novel set of threats, the risk of government overreach -- the possibility that we lose some of our core liberties in pursuit of security -- also became more pronounced.  We saw, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, our government engaged in enhanced interrogation techniques that contradicted our values.  As a Senator, I was critical of several practices, such as warrantless wiretaps.  And all too often new authorities were instituted without adequate public debate. Through a combination of action by the courts, increased congressional oversight, and adjustments by the previous administration, some of the worst excesses that emerged after 9/11 were curbed by the time I took office.  But a variety of factors have continued to complicate Americas efforts to both defend our nation and uphold our civil liberties. First, the same technological advances that allow U.S. intelligence agencies to pinpoint an al Qaeda cell in Yemen or an email between two terrorists in the Sahel also mean that many routine communications around the world are within our reach.  And at a time when more and more of our lives are digital, that prospect is disquieting for all of us. Second, the combination of increased digital information and powerful supercomputers offers intelligence agencies the possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats.  Its a powerful tool.  But the government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse. Third, the legal safeguards that restrict surveillance against U.S. persons without a warrant do not apply to foreign persons overseas.  This is not unique to America; few, if any, spy agencies around the world constrain their activities beyond their own borders.  And the whole point of intelligence is to obtain information that is not publicly available.  But Americas capabilities are unique, and the power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do.  That places a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what we should do. And finally, intelligence agencies cannot function without secrecy, which makes their work less subject to public debate.  Yet there is an inevitable bias not only within the intelligence community, but among all of us who are responsible for national security, to collect more information about the world, not less.  So in the absence of institutional requirements for regular debate -- and oversight that is public, as well as private or classified -- the danger of government overreach becomes more acute.  And this is particularly true when surveillance technology and our reliance on digital information is evolving much faster than our laws. For all these reasons, I maintained a healthy skepticism toward our surveillance programs after I became President.  I ordered that our programs be reviewed by my national security team and our lawyers, and in some cases I ordered changes in how we did business.  We increased oversight and auditing, including new structures aimed at compliance.  Improved rules were proposed by the government and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.  And we sought to keep Congress continually updated on these activities. What I did not do is stop these programs wholesale -- not only because I felt that they made us more secure, but also because nothing in that initial review, and nothing that I have learned since, indicated that our intelligence community has sought to violate the law or is cavalier about the civil liberties of their fellow citizens. To the contrary, in an extraordinarily difficult job -- one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic -- the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people.  Theyre not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls or read your emails.  When mistakes are made -- which is inevitable in any large and complicated human enterprise -- they correct those mistakes.  Laboring in obscurity, often unable to discuss their work even with family and friends, the men and women at the NSA know that if another 9/11 or massive cyber-attack occurs, they will be asked, by Congress and the media, why they failed to connect the dots.  What sustains those who work at NSA and our other intelligence agencies through all these pressures is the knowledge that their professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our nation. Now, to say that our intelligence community follows the law, and is staffed by patriots, is not to suggest that I or others in my administration felt complacent about the potential impact of these programs.  Those of us who hold office in America have a responsibility to our Constitution, and while I was confident in the integrity of those who lead our intelligence community, it was clear to me in observing our intelligence operations on a regular basis that changes in our technological capabilities were raising new questions about the privacy safeguards currently in place. Moreover, after an extended review of our use of drones in the fight against terrorist networks, I believed a fresh examination of our surveillance programs was a necessary next step in our effort to get off the open-ended war footing that weve maintained since 9/11.  And for these reasons, I indicated in a speech at the National Defense University last May that we needed a more robust public discussion about the balance between security and liberty.  Of course, what I did not know at the time is that within weeks of my speech, an avalanche of unauthorized disclosures would spark controversies at home and abroad that have continued to this day. And given the fact of an open investigation, Im not going to dwell on Mr. Snowdens actions or his motivations; I will say that our nations defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nations secrets.  If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy.  Moreover, the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light, while revealing methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come. Regardless of how we got here, though, the task before us now is greater than simply repairing the damage done to our operations or preventing more disclosures from taking place in the future.  Instead, we have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require.  We need to do so not only because it is right, but because the challenges posed by threats like terrorism and proliferation and cyber-attacks are not going away any time soon.  They are going to continue to be a major problem.  And for our intelligence community to be effective over the long haul, we must maintain the trust of the American people, and people around the world. This effort will not be completed overnight, and given the pace of technological change, we shouldnt expect this to be the last time America has this debate.  But I want the American people to know that the work has begun.  Over the last six months, I created an outside Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies to make recommendations for reform.  I consulted with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, created by Congress.  Ive listened to foreign partners, privacy advocates, and industry leaders.  My administration has spent countless hours considering how to approach intelligence in this era of diffuse threats and technological revolution.  So before outlining specific changes that Ive ordered, let me make a few broad observations that have emerged from this process. First, everyone who has looked at these problems, including skeptics of existing programs, recognizes that we have real enemies and threats, and that intelligence serves a vital role in confronting them.  We cannot prevent terrorist attacks or cyber threats without some capability to penetrate digital communications -- whether its to unravel a terrorist plot; to intercept malware that targets a stock exchange; to make sure air traffic control systems are not compromised; or to ensure that hackers do not empty your bank accounts.  We are expected to protect the American people; that requires us to have capabilities in this field. Moreover, we cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies.  There is a reason why BlackBerrys and iPhones are not allowed in the White House Situation Room.  We know that the intelligence services of other countries -- including some who feign surprise over the Snowden disclosures -- are constantly probing our government and private sector networks, and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations, and intercept our emails, and compromise our systems.  We know that. Meanwhile, a number of countries, including some who have loudly criticized the NSA, privately acknowledge that America has special responsibilities as the worlds only superpower; that our intelligence capabilities are critical to meeting these responsibilities, and that they themselves have relied on the information we obtain to protect their own people. Second, just as ardent civil libertarians recognize the need for robust intelligence capabilities, those with responsibilities for our national security readily acknowledge the potential for abuse as intelligence capabilities advance and more and more private information is digitized.  After all, the folks at NSA and other intelligence agencies are our neighbors.  They're our friends and family.  Theyve got electronic bank and medical records like everybody else.  They have kids on Facebook and Instagram, and they know, more than most of us, the vulnerabilities to privacy that exist in a world where transactions are recorded, and emails and text and messages are stored, and even our movements can increasingly be tracked through the GPS on our phones. Third, there was a recognition by all who participated in these reviews that the challenges to our privacy do not come from government alone.  Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy, store and analyze our data, and use it for commercial purposes; thats how those targeted ads pop up on your computer and your smartphone periodically.  But all of us understand that the standards for government surveillance must be higher.  Given the unique power of the state, it is not enough for leaders to say:  Trust us, we wont abuse the data we collect.  For history has too many examples when that trust has been breached.  Our system of government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power; it depends on the law to constrain those in power. I make these observations to underscore that the basic values of most Americans when it comes to questions of surveillance and privacy converge a lot more than the crude characterizations that have emerged over the last several months.  Those who are troubled by our existing programs are not interested in repeating the tragedy of 9/11, and those who defend these programs are not dismissive of civil liberties. The challenge is getting the details right, and that is not simple.  In fact, during the course of our review, I have often reminded myself I would not be where I am today were it not for the courage of dissidents like Dr. King, who were spied upon by their own government.  And as President, a President who looks at intelligence every morning, I also cant help but be reminded that America must be vigilant in the face of threats. Fortunately, by focusing on facts and specifics rather than speculation and hypotheticals, this review process has given me -- and hopefully the American people -- some clear direction for change.  And today, I can announce a series of concrete and substantial reforms that my administration intends to adopt administratively or will seek to codify with Congress. First, I have approved a new presidential directive for our signals intelligence activities both at home and abroad.  This guidance will strengthen executive branch oversight of our intelligence activities.  It will ensure that we take into account our security requirements, but also our alliances; our trade and investment relationships, including the concerns of American companies; and our commitment to privacy and basic liberties.  And we will review decisions about intelligence priorities and sensitive targets on an annual basis so that our actions are regularly scrutinized by my senior national security team. Second, we will reform programs and procedures in place to provide greater transparency to our surveillance activities, and fortify the safeguards that protect the privacy of U.S. persons.  Since we began this review, including information being released today, we have declassified over 40 opinions and orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which provides judicial review of some of our most sensitive intelligence activities -- including the Section 702 program targeting foreign individuals overseas, and the Section 215 telephone metadata program. And going forward, Im directing the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General, to annually review for the purposes of declassification any future opinions of the court with broad privacy implications, and to report to me and to Congress on these efforts.  To ensure that the court hears a broader range of privacy perspectives, I am also calling on Congress to authorize the establishment of a panel of advocates from outside government to provide an independent voice in significant cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Third, we will provide additional protections for activities conducted under Section 702, which allows the government to intercept the communications of foreign targets overseas who have information thats important for our national security.  Specifically, I am asking the Attorney General and DNI to institute reforms that place additional restrictions on governments ability to retain, search, and use in criminal cases communications between Americans and foreign citizens incidentally collected under Section 702. Fourth, in investigating threats, the FBI also relies on what's called national security letters, which can require companies to provide specific and limited information to the government without disclosing the orders to the subject of the investigation.  These are cases in which it's important that the subject of the investigation, such as a possible terrorist or spy, isnt tipped off.  But we can and should be more transparent in how government uses this authority. I have therefore directed the Attorney General to amend how we use national security letters so that this secrecy will not be indefinite, so that it will terminate within a fixed time unless the government demonstrates a real need for further secrecy.  We will also enable communications providers to make public more information than ever before about the orders that they have received to provide data to the government. This brings me to the program that has generated the most controversy these past few months -- the bulk collection of telephone records under Section 215.  Let me repeat what I said when this story first broke:  This program does not involve the content of phone calls, or the names of people making calls.  Instead, it provides a record of phone numbers and the times and lengths of calls -- metadata that can be queried if and when we have a reasonable suspicion that a particular number is linked to a terrorist organization.

We have a lot of folks who have been waiting all day to talk to you, so I want to get right to it. Governor Romney, as you know, you won the coin toss, so the first question will go to you.  And I want to turn to a first-time voter, Jeremy Epstein, who has a question for you. Q:  Mr. President, Governor Romney, as a 20-year-old college student, all I hear from professors, neighbors and others is that when I graduate I'll have little chance to get employment.  What can you say to reassure me, but more importantly, my parents, that I will be able to sufficiently support myself after I graduate? Governor Romney:  Thank you, Jeremy.  I appreciate your question.  And thank you for being here this evening.  And to all of those from Nassau County here that have come, thank you for your time.  Thank you to Hofstra University and to Candy Crowley for organizing and leading this event. Thank you, Mr. President, also for being part of this debate. Your question is one that's being asked by college kids all over this country.  I was in Pennsylvania with someone who had just graduated.  This was in Philadelphia -- and she said I've got my degree, I can't find a job.  I've got three part-time jobs; theyre just barely enough to pay for my food and pay for an apartment.  I can't begin to pay back my student loans.  So what we have to do is two things.  We have to make sure that we make it easier for kids to afford college, and also make sure that when they get out of college theres a job.  When I was governor of Massachusetts, to get a high school degree you had to pass an exam.  If you graduated in the top quarter of your class, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship -- four years tuition-free to the college of your choice in Massachusetts that's a public institution. I want to make sure we keep our Pell Grant program growing. We're also going to have our loan program so that people are able to afford school.  But the key thing is to make sure you can get a job when you get out of school.  And whats happened over the last four years has been very, very hard for Americas young people.  I want you to be able to get a job.  I know what it takes to get this economy going.  With half of college kids graduating this year without a college -- excuse me -- without a job and without a college-level job, thats just unacceptable.  And likewise, you got more and more debt on your back.  So more debt and less jobs.  I'm going to change that.  I know what it takes to create good jobs again.  I know what it takes to make sure that you have the kind of opportunity you deserve.  And kids across this country are going to recognize we're bringing back an economy.  Its not going to be like the last four years.  The middle class has been crushed over the last four years.  And jobs have been too scarce.  I know what it takes to bring them back, and I'm going to do that and make sure when you graduate -- when do you graduate?  Q:  2014. Governor Romney:  2014.  When you come out in 2014, I presume I'm going to be President -- I'm going to make sure you get a job.  Thanks, Jeremy. Q:  Thank you. Governor Romney:  Yeah, you bet.  Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President. President Obama:  Jeremy, first of all, your future is bright. And the fact that youre making an investment in higher education is critical not just to you, but to the entire nation.  Now, the most important thing we can do is to make sure that we are creating jobs in this country, but not just jobs -- good-paying jobs, ones that can support a family. And what I want to do is build on the 5 million jobs that weve created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone.  And there are a bunch of things that we can do to make sure your future is bright. Number one:  I want to build manufacturing jobs in this country again.  When Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I said, were going to bet on American workers and the American auto industry, and its come surging back.  I want to do that in industries not just in Detroit but all across the country.  And that means we change our tax code so were giving incentives to companies that are investing here in the United States and creating jobs here.  It also means were helping them and small businesses to export all around the world to new markets. Number two:  Weve got to make sure that we have the best education system in the world.  And the fact that youre going to college is great, but I want everybody to get a great education. And weve worked hard to make sure that student loans are available for folks like you.  But I also want to make sure that community colleges are offering slots for workers to get retrained for the jobs that are there right now, and the jobs of the future. Number three:  Weve got to control our own energy.  Not only oil and natural gas, which weve been investing in, but also weve got to make sure were building the energy sources of the future -- not just thinking about next year, but 10 years from now, 20 years from now.  That's why we invest in solar and wind and biofuels, energy-efficient cars. Weve got to reduce our deficit, but weve got to do it in a balanced way -- asking the wealthy to pay a little bit more along with cuts so that we can invest in education like yours.  And lets take the money that weve been spending on war over the last decade to rebuild America -- roads, bridges, schools.  We do those things, not only is your future going to be bright, but Americas future is going to be bright as well. Ms. Crowley:  Let me ask you for a more immediate answer, beginning with Mr. Romney.  Just quickly, what can you do?  Were looking at a situation where 40 percent of the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or more.  They don't have the two years that Jeremy has.  What about those long-term unemployed who need a job right now? Governor Romney:  Well, what you're seeing in this country is 23 million people struggling to find a job and a lot of them, as you say, Candy, have been out of work for a long, long, long time.  The Presidents policies have been exercised over the last four years and they havent put Americans back to work.  We have fewer people working today than we had when the President took office.  If the -- the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent when he took office; its 7.8 percent now.  But if you calculated that unemployment rate taking back the people who dropped out of the workforce, it would be 10.7 percent.  We have not made the progress we need to make to put people back to work.  That's why I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.  Its going to help Jeremy get a job when he comes out of school.  Its going to help people across the country that are unemployed right now.  And one thing that the President said, which I want to make sure that we understand -- he said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt.  And that's right.  My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Continental Airlines, and come out stronger.  And I know he keeps saying, you wanted to take Detroit bankrupt.  Well, the President took Detroit bankrupt.  You took General Motors bankrupt.  You took Chrysler bankrupt.  So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did.  And I think it's important to know that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet so they could start hiring more people.  That was precisely what I recommended and ultimately what happened. Ms. Crowley:  Let me give the President a chance.  Go ahead. President Obama:  Candy, what Governor Romney said just isn't true.  He wanted to take them into bankruptcy without providing them any way to stay open, and we would have lost a million jobs. And don't take my word for it.  Take the executives at GM and Chrysler, some of whom are Republicans, may even support Governor Romney, but they'll tell you his prescription wasn't going to work. And Governor Romney says he's got a five-point plan.  Governor Romney doesn't have a five-point plan; he has a one-point plan.  And that plan is to make sure that folks at the top play by a different set of rules.  That's been his philosophy in the private sector.  That's been his philosophy as governor.  That's been his philosophy as a presidential candidate.  You can make a lot of money and pay lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less.  You can ship jobs overseas and get tax breaks for it.  You can invest in a company, bankrupt it, lay off the workers, strip away their pensions and you still make money.  That's exactly the philosophy that we've seen in place for the last decade.  That's what's been squeezing middle-class families.  And we have fought back for four years to get out of that mess.  The last thing we need to do is to go back to the very same policies that got us there.  Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, the next question is going to be for you here.  And Mr. Romney -- Governor Romney, they'll be plenty of chances here to go on, but I want to -- Governor Romney:  That Detroit answer -- Ms. Crowley:  -- we have all these folks -- I will let you absolutely -- Governor Romney:  -- and the rest of the answer, way off the mark. Ms. Crowley:  Okay.  You certainly will have lots of time here coming up, because I want to move you on to something that's sort of connected to cars here and go over -- and we want to get a question from Phillip DiCola [ph].  Q:  Your Energy Secretary, Steven Chu, has now been on record three times stating it's not policy of his department to help lower gas prices.  Do you agree with Secretary Chu that this is not the job of the Energy Department? President Obama:  The most important thing we can do is to make sure we control our own energy.  So here's what I've done since I've been President.  We have increased oil production to the highest levels in 16 years.  Natural gas production is the highest it's been in decades.  We have seen increases in coal production and coal employment.  But what I've also said is we can't just produce traditional sources of energy.  We've also got to look to the future.  That's why we doubled fuel-efficiency standards on cars.  That means that in the middle of the next decade, any car you buy you're going to end up going twice as far on a gallon of gas.  That's why we've doubled clean energy production like wind and solar and biofuels. And all these things have contributed to us lowering our oil imports to the lowest levels in 16 years.  Now, I want to build on that.  And that means, yes, we still continue to open up new areas for drilling.  We continue to make it a priority for us to go after natural gas.  We've got potentially 600,000 jobs and a hundred years' worth of energy right beneath our feet with natural gas.  And we can do it in an environmentally sound way. But we've also got to continue to figure out how we have efficient energy, because ultimately that's how we're going to reduce demand and that's what's going to keep gas prices lower.  Now, Governor Romney will say he's got an all-of-the-above plan.  But basically, his plan is to let the oil companies write the energy policies.  So he's got the oil and gas part, but he doesn't have the clean energy part.  And if were only thinking about tomorrow or the next day, and not thinking about 10 years from now, we're not going to control our own economic future.  Because China, Germany -- they're making these investments.  And I'm not going to cede those jobs of the future to those countries.  I expect those new energy sources to be built right here in the United States.  That's going to help Jeremy get a job.  It's also going to make sure that you're not paying as much for gas. Ms. Crowley:  Governor, on the subject of gas prices? Governor Romney:  Well, let's look at the President's policies, all right, as opposed to the rhetoric, because we've had four years of policies being played out.  And the President is right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land.  As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production is down 9 percent.  Why? Because the President cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands and in federal waters.  So where did the increase come from?  Well, a lot of it came from the Bakken Range in North Dakota.  What was his participation there?  The America brought a criminal action against the people drilling up there for oil -- this massive new resource we have.  And what was the cause?  Twenty or 25 birds were killed and they brought out a migratory bird act to go after them on a criminal basis. Look, I want to make sure we use our oil, our coal, our gas, our nuclear, our renewables.  I believe very much in our renewable capabilities -- ethanol, wind, solar -- would be an important part of our energy mix.  But what we don't need is to have the President keeping us from taking advantage of oil, coal and gas.  This has not been Mr. Oil or Mr. Gas or Mr. Coal.  Talk to the people that are working in those industries.  I was in coal country.  People grabbed my arms and say, please save my job.  The head of the EPA said you can't build a coal plant, its virtually impossible given our regulations.  When the President ran for office, he said, if you build a coal plant you can go ahead, but youll go bankrupt.  That's not the right course for America.  Lets take advantage of the energy resources we have as well as the energy sources for the future.  And if we do that, if we do what I'm planning on doing, which is getting us energy-independent -- North America energy independence within eight years -- youre going to see manufacturing jobs come back, because our energy is low-cost.  Theyre already beginning to come back, because of our abundant energy. I'll get America and North America energy independent.  I'll do it by more drilling, more permits and licenses.  We're going to bring that pipeline in from Canada.  How in the world the President said no to that pipeline I will never know.  This is about bringing good jobs back for the middle class of America and that's what I'm going to do. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, let me just see if I can move you to the gist of this question, which is are we looking at the new normal?  I can tell you that tomorrow morning a lot of people in Hempstead will wake up and fill up and they will find that the price of gas is over $4 a gallon.  Is it within the purview of the government to bring those prices down, or are we looking at the new normal? President Obama:  Candy, theres no doubt that world demand has gone up.  But our production is going up.  And we're using oil more efficiently.  And very little of what Governor Romney just said is true. We've opened up public lands.  We're actually drilling more on public lands than in the previous administration -- and the previous President was an oil man.  And natural gas isn't just appearing magically -- we're encouraging it and working with the industry. And when I hear Governor Romney say hes a big coal guy -- and keep in mind, when -- Governor, when you were governor of Massachusetts, you stood in front of a coal plant and pointed at it and said, This plant kills -- and took great pride in shutting it down.  And now suddenly youre a big champion of coal. So what I've tried to do is be consistent.  With respect to something like coal, we made the largest investment in clean-coal technology to make sure that even as we're producing more coal, we're producing it cleaner and smarter.  Same thing with oil.  Same thing with natural gas. And the proof is our oil imports are down to the lowest levels in 20 years.  Oil production is up; natural gas production is up; and most importantly, we're also starting to build cars that are more efficient.  And that's creating jobs.  That means those cars can be exported because that's the demand around the world, and it also means that it will save money in your pocketbook.  That's the strategy you need, an all-of-the-above strategy, and that's what we're going to do in the next four years. Governor Romney:  But that's not what youve done in the last four years.  That's the problem.  In the last four years you cut permits and licenses on federal land and federal waters in half.  President Obama:  Not true, Governor Romney. Governor Romney:  So how much did you cut it by -- President Obama:  Not true. Governor Romney:  By how much did you cut them by then? President Obama:  Governor, we have actually produced more oil -- Governor Romney:  No, no, how much did you cut licenses and permits on federal land and federal waters? President Obama:  Governor Romney, heres what we did:  There were a whole bunch of oil companies -- Governor Romney:  No, I had a question, and the question was how much did you cut them by?  How much did you cut them by? President Obama:  You want me to answer a question, I'm happy to answer the question. Governor Romney:  All right, and it is? President Obama:  Heres what happened:  You had a whole bunch of oil companies who had leases on public lands that they werent using.  So what we said was, you cant just sit on this for 10, 20, 30 years, decide when you want to drill, when you want to produce, when its most profitable for you.  These are public lands, so if you want to drill on public lands, you use it or you lose it.  And so what we did was take away those leases, and we are now re-letting them so that we can actually make a profit. Governor Romney:  And production on private -- on government lands is down. President Obama:  And production is up.  No it isnt. Governor Romney:  Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent -- President Obama:  Governor -- Governor Romney:  -- and production of gas is down 9 percent.  President Obama:  -- what youre saying is just not true.  Its just not true. Governor Romney:  Its absolutely true.  Look, theres no question but that the people recognize that we have not produced more oil and gas -- President Obama:  Ill give you your time.  Go ahead. Governor Romney:  -- on federal lands and in federal waters. And coal -- coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.  I was just at a coal facility where some 1,200 people lost their jobs. The right course for America is to have a true all-of-the-above policy.  I dont think anyone really believes that youre a person whos going to be pushing for oil and gas and coal.  Youll get your chance in a moment.  Im still speaking. President Obama:  Well, Governor, if you -- Governor Romney:  And the answer is, I dont believe people think thats the case because I -- President Obama:  -- if youre asking me a question, Im going to answer it. Governor Romney:  It wasnt a question. President Obama:  Okay.  All right. Governor Romney:  That was a statement.  I dont think the American people believe that.  I will fight for oil, coal and natural gas.  And the proof of whether a strategy is working or not is what the price is that youre paying at the pump.  If youre paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working.  But youre paying more. When the President took office, the price of gasoline here in Nassau County was about a buck-eighty-six a gallon.  Now its four bucks a gallon.  The price of electricity is up.  If the Presidents energy policies are working, youre going to see the cost of energy come down.  I will fight to create more energy in this country to get America energy secure, and part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada, taking advantage of the oil and coal we have here; drilling offshore in Alaska; drilling offshore in Virginia, where the people want it.  Those things will get us the energy we need. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, could you address -- because we did finally get to gas prices here -- could you address what the Governor said, which is if your energy policy was working, the price of gasoline would not be $4 a gallon here.  Is that true? President Obama:  Well, think about what the Governor just said.  He said, when I took office the price of gasoline was $1.80, $1.86.  Why is that?  Because the economy was on the verge of collapse.  Because we were about to go through the worst recession since the Great Depression, as a consequence of some of the same policies that Governor Romney is now promoting. So its conceivable that Governor Romney could bring down gas prices, because with his policies we might be back in that same mess.  What I want to do is to create an economy that is strong and at the same time produce energy.  And with respect to this pipeline that Governor Romney keeps on talking about -- we've built enough pipeline to wrap around the entire Earth once.  So Im all for pipelines.  Im all for oil production.  What Im not for is us ignoring the other half of the equation.  So, for example, on wind energy, when Governor Romney says these are imaginary jobs, when youve got thousands of people right now in Iowa, right now in Colorado, who are working, creating wind power with good-paying manufacturing jobs, and the Republican Senator in Iowa is all for it, providing tax credits to help this work.  And Governor Romney says, Im opposed; Id get rid of it. Thats not an energy strategy for the future.  And we need to win that future.  And I intend to win it as President of the United States. Ms. Crowley:  Ive got to move you along.  And the next question is for you. Governor Romney:  No, he got the first -- he actually got the first question, so I get the last question -- last answer on that one.  Ms. Crowley:  Actually in the follow-up it doesnt quite work like that.  But Im going to give you a chance here.  I promise you, Im going to.  And the next question is for you, so if you want to continue on.  But I dont want to leave all these guys sitting here. Governor Romney:  Candy, I dont have a policy of stopping wind jobs in Iowa.  And theyre not phantom jobs, theyre real jobs.  I appreciate wind jobs in Iowa and across our country.  I appreciate the jobs in coal and oil and gas.  Ms. Crowley:  Okay, thank you -- Governor Romney:  Im going to make sure that taking advantage of our energy resources will bring back manufacturing to America.  Were going to get through a very aggressive energy policy -- 3.5 million more jobs in this country.  Its critical to our future. President Obama:  Candy, its okay, Im used to being interrupted. Ms. Crowley:  Were going to move you along to taxes.  All right, were going to move you both along to taxes over here and all these folks that have been waiting.  Governor, this question is for you.  It comes from Mary Polano [ph].  Governor Romney:  Hi, Mary. Q:  Governor Romney, you have stated that if youre elected President you would plan to reduce the tax rates for all the tax brackets, and that you would work with the Congress to eliminate some deductions in order to make up for the loss in revenue.  Concerning these various deductions -- the mortgage deduction, the charitable deductions, the Child Tax Credit, and also the -- oh, whats that other credit? President Obama:  Youre doing great. Q:  Oh, I remember -- the education credits, which are important to me because I have children in college.  What would be your position on those things, which are important to the middle class? Governor Romney:  Thank you very much.  And let me tell you, youre absolutely right about part of that, which is I want to bring the rates down.  I want to simplify the tax code, and I want to get middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes.  And the reason I want middle-income taxpayers to have lower taxes is because middle-income taxpayers have been buried over the past four years.  Youve seen as middle-income people in this country -- incomes go down $4,300 a family, even as gasoline prices have gone up $2,000.  Health insurance premiums up $2,500.  Food prices up.  Utility prices up.  The middle-income families in America have been crushed over the last four years, so I want to get some relief to middle-income families.  That's part one. Now, how about deductions?  Because Im going to bring rates down across the board for everybody, but Im going to limit deductions and exemptions and credits, particularly for people at the high end, because I am not going to have people at the high end pay less than they're paying now. The top 5 percent of taxpayers will continue to pay 60 percent of the income tax the nation collects.  So that will stay the same.  Middle-income people are going to get a tax break.  And so in terms of bringing down deductions, one way of doing that would be to say everybody gets -- Ill pick a number -- $25,000 of deductions and credits, and you can decide which ones to use.  Your home mortgage interest deduction, charity, child tax credit and so forth, you can use those as part of fill in that bucket, if you will, of deductions.  But your rate comes down, and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends, or capital gains; no tax on your savings.  That makes life a lot easier.  If youre getting interest from a bank, if youre getting a statement from a mutual fund, or any other kind of investments you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that because there will be no taxes for anybody making $200,000 a year and less on your interest, dividends and capital gains. Why am I lowering taxes on the middle class?  Because under the last four years, theyve been buried, and I want to help people in the middle class.  And I will not -- I will not under any circumstances reduce the share that's being paid by the highest income taxpayers.  And I will not under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle class.  The Presidents spending, the Presidents borrowing will cause this nation to have to raise taxes on the American people, not just at the high end.  A recent study has shown that people in the middle class will see $4,000 a year higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.  I will not let that happen.  Ill get us on track to a balanced budget, and Im going to reduce the tax burden on middle-income families.  And whats that going to do?  Its going to help those families, and its going to create incentives to start growing jobs again in this country. Ms. Crowley:  Thanks, Governor. President Obama:  My philosophy on taxes has been simple, and that is I want to give middle-class families and folks who are striving to get into the middle class some relief -- because they have been hit hard, over the last decade, over the last 15, over the last 20 years. So four years ago, I stood on a stage just like this one -- actually, it was a town hall -- and I said, I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and that's what I've done -- by $3,600.  I said I would cut taxes for small businesses -- who are the drivers and engines of growth -- and we've cut them 18 times.  And I want to continue those tax cuts for middle-class families and for small businesses. But what I've also said is if we're serious about reducing the deficit, if this is genuinely a moral obligation to the next generation, then in addition to some tough spending cuts, we've also got to make sure that the wealthy do a little bit more.  So what I've said is your first $250,000 worth of income, no change. And that means 98 percent of American families, 97 percent of small businesses, they will not see a tax increase.  I'm ready to sign that bill right now.  The only reason it's not happening is because Governor Romney's allies in Congress have held the 98 percent hostage, because they want tax breaks for the top 2 percent.   But what I've also said is for above $250,000, we can go back to the tax rates we had when Bill Clinton was President.  We created 23 million new jobs.  That's part of what took us from deficits to surplus.  It will be good for our economy and it will be good for job creation.  Now, Governor Romney has a different philosophy.  He was on \"60 Minutes\" just two weeks ago and he was asked, is it fair for somebody like you making $20 million a year to pay a lower tax rate than a nurse or bus driver, somebody making $50,000 a year. And he said, yes, I think that's fair.  Not only that, he said, I think that's what grows the economy.  Well, I fundamentally disagree with that.  I think what grows the economy is when you get that tax credit that we put in place for your kids going to college.  I think that grows the economy.  I think what grows the economy is when we make sure small businesses are getting a tax credit for hiring veterans who fought for our country.  That grows our economy. So we just have a different theory.  And when Governor Romney stands here, after a year of campaigning when during a Republican primary, he stood on stage and said, I'm going to give tax cuts -- he didn't say tax rate cuts, he said tax cuts -- to everybody including the top 1 percent, you should believe him, because that's been his history.  And that's exactly the kind of top-down economics that is not going to work if we want a strong middle class and an economy that's thriving for everybody.  Ms. Crowley:  Governor Romney, I'm sure you've got a reply there. Governor Romney:  You're absolutely right.  You heard what I said about my tax plan.  The top 5 percent will continue to pay 60 percent, as they do today.  I'm not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people.  I am looking to cut taxes for middle-income people.  And why do I want to bring rates down and at the same time lower exemptions and deductions, particularly for people at the high end?  Because if you bring rates down, it makes it easier for small business to keep more of their capital and hire people. And for me, this is about jobs.  I want to get America's economy going again.  Fifty-four percent of America's workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals.  So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people. For me, I look at what's happened in the last four years and say this has been a disappointment.  We can do better than this. We don't have to settle for how many months -- 43 months with unemployment above 8 percent, 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job right now.  There are 3.5 million more women living in poverty today than when the President took office.  We dont have to live like this.  We can get this economy going again.  My five-point plan does it.  Energy independence for North America in five years; opening up more trade, particularly in Latin America; cracking down on China when they cheat; getting us to a balanced budget; fixing our training programs for our workers; and, finally, championing small business.  I want to help small businesses grow and thrive.  I know how to make that happen.  I spent my life in the private sector.  I know why jobs come and why they go.  And they're going now because of the policies of this administration. Ms. Crowley:  Governor, let me ask the President something about what you just said.  The Governor says that he is not going to allow the top 5 percent -- I believe is what he said -- to have a tax cut, that it will all even out, that what he wants to do is give that tax cut to the middle class.  Settled? President Obama:  No, it's not settled.  Look, the cost of lowering rates for everybody across the board 20 percent, along with what he also wants to do in terms of eliminating the estate tax, along with what he wants to do in terms of corporate changes in the tax code, it costs about $5 trillion.  Governor Romney then also wants to spend $2 trillion on additional military programs, even though the military is not asking for them.  That's $7 trillion.  He also wants to continue the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.  That's another trillion dollars.  That's $8 trillion.  Now, what he says is he's going to make sure that this doesn't add to the deficit and he's going to cut middle-class taxes.  But when he's asked how are you going to do it, which deductions, which loopholes are you going to close, he can't tell you.  The fact that he only has to pay 14 percent on his taxes when a lot of you are paying much higher, he's already taken that off the board.  Capital gains are going to continue to be at a low rate, so we're not going to get money that way.  We haven't heard from the Governor any specifics beyond Big Bird and eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood in terms of how he pays for that. Now, Governor Romney was a very successful investor.  If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion and then were going to pay for it, but we cant tell you until maybe after the election how were going to do it, you wouldnt have taken such a sketchy deal.  And neither should you, the American people, because the math doesnt add up.  And whats at stake here is one of two things.  Either, Candy, this blows up the deficit -- because keep in mind, this is just to pay for the additional spending that hes talking about -- $7-$8 trillion -- thats before we even get to the deficit we already have. Or, alternatively, its got to be paid for not only by closing deductions for wealthy individuals -- that will pay for about 4 percent reduction in tax rates -- youre going to be paying for it.  Youll lose some deductions.  And you cant buy this sales pitch.  Nobody whos looked at it thats serious actually believes it adds up. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, let me get the Governor in on this.  And, Governor, lets, before we get into a vast array of who says -- what study says what, if it shouldnt add up, if somehow when you get in there, there isnt enough tax revenue coming in, if somehow the numbers dont add up, would you be willing to look again at a 20 percent -- Governor Romney:  Well, of course they add up.  I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years and balanced the budget.  I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.  I ran the state of a Massachusetts as a governor, to the extent any governor does, and balanced the budget all four years. When were talking about math that doesnt add up, how about $4 trillion of deficits over the last four years -- $5 trillion? Thats math that doesnt add up.  We have a President talking about someones plan in a way thats completely foreign to what my real plan is.  And then we have his own record, which is we have four consecutive years where he said, when he was running for office, he would cut the deficit in half.  Instead, hes doubled it.  Weve gone from $10 trillion of national debt to $16 trillion of national debt.  If the President were reelected, wed go to almost $20 trillion of national debt.  This puts us on a road to Greece. I know what it takes to balance budgets.  Ive done it my entire life.  So for instance, when he says, yours is a $5 trillion cut -- well, no, its not, because Im offsetting some of the reductions, withholding down some of the deductions and I -- President Obama:  Candy -- Ms. Crowley:  Governor, Ive got to -- Governor Romney:  Im sorry -- Ms. Crowley:  Actually, I need to have you both hang -- I understand the stakes here.  I understand both of you, but I will get run out of town if I dont allow -- Governor Romney:  And I just described to you, Mr. President, I just described to you precisely how Id do it -- Ms. Crowley:   You will get -- Governor Romney:  -- which is with a single number that people can put -- and they can put their deductions and credits into that bucket. President Obama:  Are we keeping track of -- Ms. Crowley:  Let me -- Mr. President, were keeping track, I promise you.  And, Mr. President, the next question is for you -- President Obama:  Great, looking forward to it. Ms. Crowley:  -- so stay standing.  And its Catherine Fenton who has a question for you. Q:  In what new ways do you intend to rectify the inequalities in the workplace, specifically regarding females making only 72 percent of what their male counterparts earn?", "filename": "17October2012SecondPresidentialCandidateDebatewithMittRomney.txt"}, {"question": "Ms. Crowley:  Governor Romney, pay equity for women. Governor Romney:  Thank you, an important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men.  And I went to my staff and I said, how come all the people for these jobs are all men?  They said, well, these are the people that have the qualifications.  And I said, well, gosh, cant we find some women that are also qualified?  And so we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet.  I went to a number of womens groups and said, can you help us find folks?  And they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.  Now, one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort, but number two, because I recognize that if youre going to have women in the workforce that sometimes they need to be more flexible.  My chief of staff, for instance, had two kids that were still in school.  She said, I cant be here until 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. at night; I need to be able to get home at 5:00 p.m. so I can be there for making dinner for my kids and being with them when they get home from school.  So we said, fine, lets have a flexible schedule so you can have hours that work for you. Were going to have to have employers in the new economy, in the economy Im going to bring to play, that are going to be so anxious to get good workers, theyre going to be anxious to hire women. In the last four years, women have lost 580,000 jobs.  That's the net of what's happened in the last four years.  Were still down 580,000 jobs.  I mentioned 3.5 million women more now in poverty than four years ago.  What we can do to help young women and women of all ages is to have a strong economy, so strong that employers are looking to find good employees and bringing them into their workforce, and adapting to a flexible work schedule that gives women the opportunities that they would otherwise not be able to afford. This is what Ive done.  Its what I look forward to doing. And I know what it takes to make an economy work.  And I know what a working economy looks like.  And an economy with 7.8 percent unemployment is not a real strong economy.  An economy that has 23 million people looking for work is not a strong economy.  An economy with 50 percent of kids graduating from college that cant find a job, or a college-level job -- that's not what we have to have.  Im going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.  Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, why don't you get in on this quickly, please? President Obama:  Catherine, I just want to point out that when Governor Romneys campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, Ill get back to you.  And that's not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy.  Now, there are some other issues that have a bearing on how women succeed in the workplace -- for example, their health care. A major difference in this campaign is that Governor Romney feels comfortable having politicians in Washington decide the health care choices that women are making.  I think that's a mistake.  In my health care bill, I said insurance companies need to provide contraceptive coverage to everybody whos insured, because this is not just a health issue, its an economic issue for women.  It makes a difference.  This is money out of that familys pocket.  Governor Romney not only opposed it, he suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage. That's not the kind of advocacy that women need. When Governor Romney says that we should eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, there are millions of women all across the country who rely on Planned Parenthood for not just contraceptive care; they rely on it for mammograms, for cervical cancer screenings.  That's a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country, and it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work.  When we talk about child care and the credits that were providing, that makes a difference in terms of whether they can go out there and earn a living for their family. These are not just womens issues.  These are family issues. These are economic issues.  And one of the things that makes us grow as an economy is when everybody participates, and women are getting the same, fair deal as men are.  And Ive got two daughters and I want to make sure that they have the same opportunities that anybodys sons have.  And that's a part of what Im fighting for as President of the United States. Ms. Crowley:  I want to move us along here to Susan Katz [ph] who has a question.  And, Governor, its for you.  Q:  Governor Romney, I am an undecided voter because Im disappointed with the lack of progress Ive seen in the last four years.  However, I do attribute much of Americas economic and international problems to the failings and missteps of the Bush administration.  Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election.  What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush? And how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush? Governor Romney:  Thank you.  And I appreciate that question.  I just want to make sure that -- I think I was supposed to get that last answer, but I want to point out that I don't believe -- President Obama:  I don't think so, Candy.  I want to make sure your timekeepers are working here. Governor Romney:  The time -- Ms. Crowley:  The timekeepers are all working.  President Obama:  All right. Ms. Crowley:  And let me tell you that the last part, its for the two of you to talk to one another, and it isnt quite as ordered as you think.  But go ahead and use this two minutes any way youd like to, the question is on the floor. Governor Romney:  Id just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not.  Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.  And the Presidents statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong. President Obama:  Governor, that's not true. Governor Romney:  Let me come back and answer your question. President Bush and I are different people, and these are different times.  And that's why my five-point plan is so different than what he would have done.  For instance, we can now by virtue of new technology actually get all the energy we need in North America without having to go to the Arabs or the Venezuelans or anyone else.  That wasnt true in his time.  That's why my policy starts with a very robust policy to get all that energy in North America, become energy secure. Number two, trade:  Ill crack down on China.  President Bush didn't.  Im also going to dramatically expand trade in Latin America.  Its been growing about 12 percent per year over a long period of time.  I want to add more free trade agreements so well have more trade. Number three, Im going to get us to a balanced budget.  President Bush didn't.  President Obama was right -- he said that that was outrageous to have deficits as high as half a trillion dollars under the Bush years.  He was right.  But then he put in place deficits twice that size for every one of his four years, and his forecast for the next four years is more deficits almost that large.  So that's the next way Im different than President Bush. And then lets take the last one, championing small business.  Our party has been focused on big business too long.  I came through small business.  I understand how hard it is to start a small business.  That's why everything Ill do is designed to help small businesses grow and add jobs.  I want to keep their taxes down on small business.  I want regulators to see their job as encouraging small enterprise, not crushing it.  And the thing I find most troubling about Obamacare -- well, its a long list -- but one of the things I find most troubling is that when you go out and talk to small businesses and ask them what they think about it, they tell you it keeps them from hiring more people.  My priority is jobs.  I know how to make that happen.  And President Bush had a very different path for a very different time.  My path is designed in getting small businesses to grow and hire people. Ms. Crowley:  Thanks, Governor.  Mr. President. President Obama:  Well, first of all, I think its important to tell you that we did come in during some tough times.  We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when I started.  But we have been digging our way out of policies that were misplaced and focused on the top doing very well and middle-class folks not doing well. And weve seen 30 consecutive -- 31 consecutive months of job growth, 5.2 million new jobs created.  And the plans that I talked about will create even more. But when Governor Romney says that he has a very different economic plan, the centerpiece of his economic plan are tax cuts. Thats what took us from surplus to deficit.  When he talks about getting tough on China, keep in mind that Governor Romney invested in companies that were pioneers of outsourcing to China, and is currently investing in countries -- in companies that are building surveillance equipment for China to spy on its own folks.  Governor, youre the last person who is going to get tough on China. And what weve done when it comes to trade is not only sign three trade deals to open up new markets, but weve also set up a task force for trade that goes after anybody who is taking advantage of American workers or businesses, and not creating a level playing field.  Weve brought twice as many cases against unfair trading practices than the previous administration and weve won every single one thats been decided. When I said that we had to make sure that China was not flooding our domestic market with cheap tires, Governor Romney said I was being protectionist, that it wouldnt be helpful to American workers.  Well, in fact, we saved a thousand jobs.  And thats the kind of tough trade actions that are required.  But the last point I want to make is this:  There are some things where Governor Romney is different from George Bush.  George Bush didnt propose turning Medicare into a voucher.  George Bush embraced comprehensive immigration reform; he didnt call for self-deportation.  George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.  So there are differences between Governor Romney and George Bush, but theyre not on economic policy.  In some ways, hes gone to a more extreme place when it comes to social policy.  And I think thats a mistake.  Thats not how were going to move our economy forward. Ms. Crowley:  I want to move you both along to the next question because its in the same wheelhouse so you will be able to respond.  But the President does get this question.  I want to call on Michael Jones. Q:  Mr. President, I voted for you in 2008.  What have you done or accomplished to earn my vote in 2012?  Im not that optimistic as I was in 2012.  Most things I need for everyday living are very expensive. President Obama:  Well, weve gone through a tough four years, theres no doubt about it.  But four years ago, I told the American people and I told you I would cut taxes for middle-class families, and I did.  I told you Id cut taxes for small businesses, and I have.  I said that Id end the war in Iraq, and I did.  I said wed refocus attention on those who actually attacked us on 9/11, and we have gone after al Qaedas leadership like never before and Osama bin Laden is dead.  I said that we would put in place health care reform to make sure that insurance companies can't jerk you around, and if you don't have health insurance, that you'd have a chance to get affordable insurance -- and I have. I committed that I would rein in the excesses of Wall Street, and we passed the toughest Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. We've created 5 million jobs -- gone from 800,000 jobs a month being lost -- and we are making progress.  We saved an auto industry that was on the brink of collapse. Now, does that mean you're not struggling?  Absolutely not. A lot of us are.  And that's why the plan that I've put forward for manufacturing, and education, and reducing our deficit in a sensible way, using the savings from ending wars to rebuild America and putting people back to work, making sure that we are controlling our own energy, but not just the energy of today, but also the energy of the future -- all those things will make a difference. So the point is the commitments I've made I've kept.  And those that I haven't been able to keep, it's not for lack of trying and we're going to get it done in a second term.  But you should pay attention to this campaign, because Governor Romney has made some commitments as well, and I suspect he'll keep those, too.  When members of the Republican Congress say, we're going to sign a no-tax pledge so that we dont ask a dime from millionaires and billionaires to reduce our deficit so we can still invest in education and helping kids go to college, he said, me, too.  When they said, we're going to cut Planned Parenthood funding, he said, me, too.  When they said, we're going to repeal Obamacare -- the first thing I'm going to do, despite the fact that it's the same health care plan that he passed in Massachusetts and is working well -- he said, me too. That is not the kind of leadership that you need, but you should expect that those are promises he's going to keep.  Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, let me let -- President Obama:  And the choice in this election is going to be whose promises are going to be more likely to help you in your life, make sure your kids can go to college, make sure that you are getting a good-paying job, making sure that Medicare and Social Security will be there for you. Ms. Crowley:  Thank you.  Governor. Governor Romney:  I think you know better.  I think you know that these last four years haven't been so good as the President just described, and that you don't feel like you're confident that the next four years are going to be much better either.  I can tell you that if you were to elect President Obama, you know what you're going to get.  You're going to get a repeat of the last four years.  We just can't afford four more years like the last four years.  He said that by now we'd have unemployment at 5.4 percent.  The difference between where it is and 5.4 percent is 9 million Americans without work.  I wasn't the one that said 5.4 percent. This was the President's plan -- didn't get there.  He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they're on the road to bankruptcy.  He would reform them.  He'd get that done.  He hasn't even made a proposal on either one.  He said in his first year hed put out an immigration plan that would deal with our immigration challenges -- didn't even file it.   This is a President who has not been able to do what he said hed do.  He said that hed cut in half the deficit -- he hasnt done that either; in fact, he doubled it.  He said that by now, middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year.  Its gone up by $2,500 a year.  And if Obamacare is passed -- or implemented -- its already been passed -- if its implemented fully, it will be another $2,500 on top.  The middle class is getting crushed under the policies of a President who has not understood what it takes to get the economy working again.  He keeps saying, look, Ive created 5 million jobs.  Thats after losing 5 million jobs.  The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country. The unemployment, the number of people who are still looking for work, is still 23 million Americans.  There are more people in poverty -- one out of six people in poverty.  How about food stamps?  When he took office, 32 million people were on food stamps.  Today, 47 million people are on food stamps.  How about the growth of the economy?  Its growing more slowly this year than last year, and more slowly last year than the year before. The President wants to do well, I understand.  But the policies hes put in place, from Obamacare to Dodd-Frank to his tax policies to his regulatory policies -- these policies combined have not let this economy take off and grow like it could have.  You might say, well, you got an example of when it worked better?  Yes.  In the Reagan recession, where unemployment hit 10.8 percent, between that period -- the end of that recession and the equivalent period of time to today, Ronald Reagans recovery created twice as many jobs as this Presidents recovery.  Five million jobs doesnt even keep up with our population growth.  And the only reason the unemployment rate seems a little lower today is because of all the people that have dropped out of the workforce.  The President has tried, but his policies havent worked.  Hes great as a speaker and describing his plans and his vision. Thats wonderful, except we have a record to look at.  And that record shows he just hasnt been able to cut the deficit, to put in place reforms for Medicare and Social Security to preserve them, to get us the rising incomes we need.  Median incomes down $4,300 a family, and 23 million Americans out of work -- thats what this election is about.  Its about who can get the middle class in this country a bright and prosperous future and assure our kids the kind of hope and optimism they deserve. Ms. Crowley:  Governor, I want to move you along.  Dont go away, and well have plenty of time to respond.  We are quite aware of the clock for both of you.  But I want to bring in a different subject here.  Mr. President, Ill be right back with you.  Lorraine Osario [ph] has a question for you about a topic we have not heard. President Obama:  This is for Governor Romney? Ms. Crowley:  Yes, this is for Governor Romney, and well be right with you, Mr. President.  Thanks. Governor Romney:  Is it Lorena? Q:  Lorraine. Governor Romney:  Lorraine? Q:  Yes, Lorraine.  How are you doing? Governor Romney:  Good, thanks. Q:  President.  Romney:  What do you plan on doing with immigrants without their green card that are currently living here as productive members of society? Governor Romney:  Thank you, Lorraine.  Did I get that right?  Good.  Thank you for question.  And let me step back and tell you what Id like to do with our immigration policy broadly, and include an answer to your question.  First of all, this is a nation of immigrants.  We welcome people coming to this country as immigrants.  My dad was born in Mexico of American parents; Anns dad was born in Wales and is a first-generation American.  We welcome legal immigrants into this country. I want our legal system to work better.  I want it to be streamlined.  I want it to be clearer.  I dont think you have to -- shouldnt have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to get into this country legally.  I also think that we should give visas to people -- green cards, rather, to people who graduate with skills that we need.  People around the world with accredited degrees in science and math get a green card stapled to their diploma; come to the U.S. of A.  We should make sure that our legal system works.   Number two, were going to have to stop illegal immigration. There are 4 million people who are waiting in line to get here legally.  Those whove come here illegally take their place.  So I will not grant amnesty to those whove come here illegally.  What I will do is Ill put in place an employment verification system and make sure that employers that hire people who have come here illegally are sanctioned for doing so.  I wont put in place magnets for people coming here illegally.  So, for instance, I would not give drivers licenses to those that have come here illegally, as the President would.  The kids of those that came here illegally -- those kids I think should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States.  And military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident. Now, when the President ran for office he said that hed put in place in his first year a piece of legislation -- hed file a bill in his first year that would reform our immigration system  -- protect legal immigration, stop illegal immigration.  He didnt do it.  He had a Democrat House, a Democrat Senate, a supermajority in both houses.  Why did he fail to even promote legislation that would have provided an answer for those that want to come here legally and for those that are here illegally today?  Thats a question I think the President will have a chance to answer to answer right now. President Obama:  Good, I look forward to it.  Was it Lorena? Lorraine.  We are a nation of immigrants.  Were just a few miles away from Ellis Island.  We all understand what this country has become because talent from all around the world wants to come here.  People are willing to take risks.  People who want to build on their dreams and make sure their kids have even bigger dreams than they have. But were also a nation of laws.  So what Ive said is we need to fix a broken immigration system.  And Ive done everything I can on my own, and sought cooperation from Congress to make sure that we fixed the system.  First thing we did was to streamline the legal immigration system to reduce the backlog, make it easier, simpler and cheaper for people who are waiting in line, obeying the law, to make sure that they can come here and contribute to our country.  And that's good for our economic growth.  Theyll start new businesses.  Theyll make things happen that create jobs here in the United States.  Number two, we do have to deal with our border, so we put more Border Patrol on than any time in history, and the flow of undocumented workers across the border is actually lower than its been in 40 years. What Ive also said is if were going to go after folks who are here illegally, we should do it smartly and go after folks who are criminals, gangbangers, people who are hurting the community -- not after students.  Not after folks who are here just because they're trying to figure out how to feed their families.  And that's what weve done.  And what Ive also said is for young people who come here, brought here oftentimes by their parents, have gone to school here, pledged allegiance to the flag, think of this as their country, understand themselves as Americans in every way except having papers, then we should make sure that we give them a pathway to citizenship.  And that's what Ive done administratively. Now, Governor Romney just said that he wants to help those young people, too.  But during the Republican primary he said, I will veto the DREAM Act that would allow these young people to have access.  His main strategy during the Republican primary was to say, were going to encourage self-deportation -- making life so miserable on folks that theyll leave.  He called the Arizona law a model for the nation -- part of the Arizona law said that law enforcement officers could stop folks because they suspected maybe they looked like they might be undocumented workers and check their papers.  And you know what, if my daughter or yours looks to somebody like they're not a citizen, I don't want to empower somebody like that.  So we can fix this system in a comprehensive way.  And when Governor Romney says the challenge is, well, Obama didn't try -- that's not true.  I sat down with Democrats and Republicans at the beginning of my term, and I said, lets fix this system, including senators previously who had supported it on the Republican side.  But its very hard for Republicans in Congress to support comprehensive immigration reform if their standard bearer has said that, this is not something Im interested in supporting. Ms. Crowley:  Let me get the Governor in here, Mr. President.  Lets speak to, if you could, Governor -- Governor Romney:  Lets. Ms. Crowley:  -- the idea of self-deportation. Governor Romney:  No, let me go back and speak to the points that the President made and lets get them correct.  I did not say that the Arizona law was a model for the nation in that aspect.  I said that the E-Verify portion of the Arizona law, which is -- which is the portion of the law which says that employers could be able to determine whether someone is here illegally or not illegally, that that was a model for the nation. That's number one. Number two, I asked the President a question I think Hispanics and immigrants all over the nation have asked.  He was asked this on Univision the other day.  Why, when you said youd file legislation in your first year, didnt you do it?  And he didnt answer.  He doesnt answer that question.  He said the standard bearer wasnt for it.  Im glad you thought I was a standard bearer four years ago, but I wasn't.  Four years ago, you said in your first year, you would file legislation.  In his first year, I was just getting -- licking my wounds from having been beaten by John McCain, all right.  I was not the standard bearer.  My view is that this President should have honored his promise to do as he said. Now, let me mention one other thing and that is self-deportation says let people make their own choice.  What I was saying is were not going to round up 12 million people, undocumented, illegals, and take them out of the nation.  Instead, let people make their own choice.  And if they find that they cant get the benefits here that they want and they cant find the job they want, then theyll make a decision to go a place where they have better opportunities. But Im not in favor of rounding up people and taking them out of this country.  I am in favor, as the President has said and I agree with him, which is that if people have committed crimes weve got to get them out of this country. Let me mention something else the President said.  It was a moment ago and I didnt get a chance to -- when he was describing Chinese investments and so forth -- President Obama:  Candy, hold on a second.  At some point -- Governor Romney:  Mr. President, Im still speaking. Ms. Crowley:  Im sorry -- Governor Romney:  Mr. President, why don't you let me finish -- President Obama::  Governor Romney, Im used to -- Governor Romney:  Im going -- Im going to continue -- Im going to continue.  If the President made -- Ms. Crowley:  Go ahead and finish, Governor Romney.  Governor Romney, if you could make it short.  See all these people, theyve been waiting for you.  Could you make it short and then -- Governor Romney:  Yes, just going to make a point.  Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust.  And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in Chinese companies. Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? President Obama:  Candy -- Governor Romney:  Have you looked at your pension? President Obama:  Ive got to say -- Candy -- Governor Romney:  Mr. President, have you looked at your pension? President Obama:  You know, I dont look at my pension.  Its not as big as yours so it doesnt take as long. Governor Romney:  Let me give you some advice. President Obama:  I dont check it that often. Governor Romney:  Look at your pension.  You also have investments in Chinese companies.  You also have investments outside the United States.  You also have investments through a Caymans trust. Ms. Crowley:  We are sort of way off topic here, Governor Romney. President Obama:  Were a little off topic here. Ms. Crowley:  We are completely off immigration. President Obama:  I know we were talking about immigration. Ms. Crowley:  And weve -- quickly, Mr. President -- President Obama:  I do want to make sure -- Ms. Crowley:  If I could have you sit down, Governor Romney.  Thank you. President Obama:  I do want to make sure that we just understand something.  Governor Romney says he wasnt referring to Arizona as a model for the nation.  His top advisor on immigration is the guy who designed the Arizona law, the entirety of it.  Not E-Verify, the whole thing.  Thats his policy.  And its a bad policy.  And it wont help us grow. Look, when we think about immigration, we have to understand there are folks all around the world who still see America as the land of promise.  And they provide us energy and they provide us innovation, and they start companies like Intel and Google -- and we want to encourage that. Now, weve got to make sure that we do it in a smart way, in a comprehensive way, and we make the legal system better.  But when we make this into a divisive political issue, and when we dont have bipartisan support -- I can deliver, Governor, a whole bunch of Democrats to get comprehensive immigration reform done, and we cant -- Governor Romney:  Ill get it done.  Ill get it done the first year -- President Obama:  -- we have not seen Republicans serious about this issue at all. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, let me move you on here, please.  Mr. President -- President Obama:  And its time for them to get serious on this.  Ms. Crowley:  Dont go away, though.  President Obama:  This used to be a bipartisan issue. Ms. Crowley:  Right.  Dont go away, because -- President Obama:  Im here. Ms. Crowley:  -- I want you to talk to Carey Ladka [ph], who wants to switch the topic for us. President Obama:  Okay.  Hi, Carey. Q:  Good evening, Mr. President. President Obama:  Im sorry, whats your name? Q:  Its Carey.  Carey Ladka [ph]. President Obama:  Great to see you, Carey. Q:  This question actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom Supply in Mineola yesterday.  We were sitting around talking about Libya, and we were reading and became aware of reports that the State Department refused extra security for our embassy in Benghazi, Libya, prior to the attacks that killed four Americans.  Who was it that denied enhanced security, and why? President Obama:  Well, let me, first of all, talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation.  And these arent just representatives of the United States.  Theyre my representatives.  I send them there, oftentimes into harms way. I know these folks, and I know these families.  So nobody is more concerned about their safety and security than I am. So as soon as we found out that the Benghazi consulate was being overrun, I was on the phone with my national security team, and I gave them three instructions.  Number one, beef up our security and procedures not just in Libya but in every embassy and consulate in the region.  Number two, investigate exactly what happened, regardless of where the facts lead us, to make sure that folks are held accountable and it doesnt happen again. And number three, we are going to find out who did this and we are going to hunt them down, because one of the things that Ive said throughout my presidency is when folks mess with Americans, we go after them. Now, Governor Romney had a very different response.  While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release, trying to make political points.  And that's not how a Commander-in-Chief operates.  You don't turn national security into a political issue, certainly not right when its happening.  And people -- not everybody agrees with some of the decisions Ive made, but when it comes to our national security, I mean what I say.  I said Id end the war in Libya -- in Iraq, and I did.  I said that wed go after al Qaeda and bin Laden -- we have.  I said wed transition out of Afghanistan and start making sure that Afghans are responsible for their own security. That's what Im doing. And when it comes to this issue, when I say that we are going to find out exactly what happened, everybody will be held accountable -- and I am ultimately responsible for whats taking place there, because these are my folks, and Im the one who has to greet those coffins when they come home, you know that I mean what I say. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, Ive got to move us along.  Governor? Governor Romney:  Thank you, Carey, for your question.  Its an important one, and I think the President just said correctly that the buck does stop at his desk, and he takes responsibility for that -- for the failure in providing those security resources.  And those terrible things may well happen from time to time.  I feel very deeply sympathetic for the families of those who lost loved ones.  And today theres a memorial service for one of those that was lost in this tragedy.  We think of their families and care for them deeply. There were other issues associated with this tragedy.  There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.  And there was no demonstration involved.  It was a terrorist attack.  And it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.  Whether there was some misleading or instead whether we just didnt know what happened, I think you have to ask yourself, why didnt we know five days later when the Ambassador to the United Nations went on TV to say that this was a demonstration -- how could we have not known?  But I find more troubling than this that on the day following the assassination of the United States ambassador -- the first time that's happened since 1979 -- when we have four Americans killed there, when apparently we didnt know what happened, that the President, the day after that happened, flies to Las Vegas for a political fundraiser, then the next day to Colorado for another event, another political event.  I think these actions taken by a President and a leader have symbolic significance, and perhaps even material significance in that youd hope that during that time we could call in the people who were actually eyewitnesses.  Weve read their accounts now about what happened.  It was very clear this was not a demonstration.  This was an attack by terrorists.  And this calls into question the Presidents whole policy in the Middle East.  Look what's happening in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.  Consider the distance between ourselves and Israel.  The President said that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.  We have Iran four years closer to a nuclear bomb.  Syria -- Syria is not just the tragedy of 30,000 civilians being killed by a military, but also a strategically significant player for America.  The Presidents policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour, and pursue a strategy of leading from behind.  And this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes. Ms. Crowley:  Because were closing in, I want to still get a lot of people in.  I want to ask you something, Mr. President, and then have the Governor just quickly.  Your Secretary of State, as Im sure you know, has said that she takes full responsibility for the attack on the diplomatic mission in Benghazi.  Does the buck stop with your Secretary of State, as far as what went on here? President Obama:  Secretary Clinton has done an extraordinary job, but she works for me.  Im the President, and Im always responsible.  And thats why nobody is more interested in finding out exactly what happened than I do.  The day after the attack, Governor, I stood in the Rose Garden and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror, and I also said that were going to hunt down those who committed this crime.  And then a few days later, I was there greeting the caskets coming into Andrews Air Force Base, and grieving with the families.  And the suggestion that anybody on my team -- whether the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador -- anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when weve lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive.  Thats not what we do.  Thats not what I do as President.  Thats not what I do as Commander-in-Chief. Ms. Crowley:  Governor, if you want to reply quickly to this please. Governor Romney:  Yes, I surely do.  I think its interesting the President just said something, which is that on the day after the attack he went in the Rose Garden and said that this was an attack of terror. President Obama:  Thats what I said. Governor Romney:  You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack it was an act of terror?  It was not a spontaneous demonstration? President Obama:  Please proceed. Governor Romney:  Is that what youre saying? President Obama:  Please proceed, Governor. Governor Romney:  I want to make sure we get that for the record, because it took the President 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.  President Obama:  Get the transcript. Ms. Crowley:  He did, in fact, sir.  So let me call it an act of terror in the Rose Garden.  He used the word -- President Obama:  Can you say that a little louder, Candy? Ms. Crowley:  He did call it an act of terror.  It did, as well, take -- it did, as well, take two weeks or so for the whole idea of there being a riot out there about this tape to come out. You are correct about that. Governor Romney:  The administration indicated that this was a reaction to a video and was a spontaneous reaction. Ms. Crowley:  They did. Governor Romney:  It took them a long time to say this was a terrorist act by a terrorist group.  And to suggest -- am I incorrect in that regard? On Sunday, your Secretary -- President Obama:  Candy? Governor Romney:  -- excuse me, the Ambassador to the United Nations went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how this was a spontaneous reaction. President Obama:  Candy, Im happy to have a longer conversation about foreign policy. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, let me -- I know you -- absolutely.  But I want to move you on. President Obama:  Okay, Im happy to do that, too. Ms. Crowley:  And also, people can go to the transcripts and -- President Obama:  I just want to make sure that -- Ms. Crowley:  -- figure out what was said and when. President Obama:  -- all those wonderful folks are going to have a chance to get some of their questions answered. Ms. Crowley:  Because what I want to do, Mr. President -- stand there for a second, because I want to introduce you to Nina Gonzalez, who brought up a question that we hear a lot both over the Internet and from this crowd. Q:  President Obama, during the Democratic National Convention in 2008, you stated you wanted to keep AK-47s out of the hands of criminals.  What has your administration done or plan to do to limit the availability of assault weapons? President Obama:  Were a nation that believes in the Second Amendment, and I believe in the Second Amendment.  Weve got a long tradition of hunting and sportsmen, and people who want to make sure they can protect themselves.  But there have been too many instances during the course of my presidency where Ive had to comfort families who have lost somebody -- most recently, out in Aurora.  Just a couple of weeks ago -- actually probably about a month, I saw a mother who I had met at the bedside of her son who had been shot in that theater. And her son had been shot through the head.  And we spent some time and we said a prayer.  And remarkably, about two months later, this young man and his mom showed up, and he looked unbelievable -- good as new.  But there were a lot of families who didnt have that good fortune, and whose sons or daughters or husbands didnt survive.  So my belief is that, A, we have to enforce the laws weve already got; make sure that were keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, those who are mentally ill.  Weve done a much better job in terms of background checks, but weve got more to do when it comes to enforcement.  But I also share your belief that weapons that were designed for soldiers in war theaters dont belong on our streets.  And so what Im trying to do is to get a broader conversation about how do we reduce the violence generally.  Part of it is seeing if we can get an assault weapons ban reintroduced, but part of it is also looking at other sources of the violence -- because, frankly, in my hometown of Chicago theres an awful lot of violence, and theyre not using AK-47s, theyre using cheap handguns.  And so what can we do to intervene, to make sure that young people have opportunity?  That our schools are working?  That if theres violence on the streets, that working with faith groups and law enforcement, we can catch it before it gets out of  control.  And so what I want is a comprehensive strategy.  Part of it is seeing if we can get automatic weapons that kill folks in amazing numbers out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.  But part of it is also going deeper and seeing if we can get into these communities and making sure we catch violent impulses before they occur. Ms. Crowley:  Governor Romney, the question is about assault weapons, AK-47s. Governor Romney:  Yes, Im not in favor of new pieces of legislation on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal.  We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.  What I believe is we have to do, as the President mentioned towards the end of his remarks there, which is to make enormous efforts to enforce the gun laws that we have and to change the culture of violence we have.  And you ask how are we going to do that?", "filename": "17October2012SecondPresidentialCandidateDebatewithMittRomney.txt"}, {"question": "Governor Romney:  -- drug lords -- Ms. Crowley:  Governor, if I could, the question was about these assault weapons that once were banned and are no longer banned.  I know that you signed an assault weapons ban when you were in Massachusetts.  Obviously with this question, you no longer do support that.  Why is that?  Given the kind of violence that we see sometimes with these mass killings, why is that, that youve changed your mind? Governor Romney:  Well, Candy, actually, in my state, the pro-gun folks and the anti-gun folks came together and put together a piece of legislation.  And its referred to as an assault weapon ban, but it had, at the signing of the bill, both the pro-gun and the anti-gun people came together because it provided opportunities for both that both wanted.  There were hunting opportunities, for instance, that hadnt previously been available and so forth.  So it was a mutually agreed upon piece of legislation. Thats what we need more of, Candy.  What we have right now in Washington is a place thats gridlocked. Ms. Crowley:  So if you could get people to agree to it, youd be for it? President Obama:  Candy. Governor Romney:  We havent had the leadership in Washington to work at a bipartisan basis.  I was able to do that in my state and bring these two together. President Obama:  Candy. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President. President Obama:  First of all, I think Governor Romney was for an assault weapons ban before he was against it.  And he said that the reason he changed his mind was, in part, because he was seeking the endorsement of the National Rifle Association.  So thats on the record. But I think that one area we agree on is the importance of parents and the importance of schools -- because I do believe that if our young people have opportunity, then theyre less likely to engage in these kind of violent acts.  Were not going to eliminate everybody who is mentally disturbed, and weve got to make sure that they dont get weapons, but we can make a difference in terms of ensuring that every young person in America, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, have a chance to succeed. And, Candy, we havent had a chance to talk about education much, but I think it is very important to understand that the reforms weve put in place, working with 46 governors around the country, are seeing schools that are some of the ones that are the toughest for kids starting to succeed -- were starting to see gains in math and science. When it comes to community colleges, we are setting up programs, including with Nassau Community College, to retrain workers, including young people who may have dropped out of school, but now are getting another chance -- training them for the jobs that exist right now.  And in fact, employers are looking for skilled workers, and so were matching them up, giving them access to higher education.  As I said, we have made sure that millions of young people are able to get an education that they werent able to get before.  Now -- Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, I have to move you along here. You said you wanted to get this question so we need to do it here. President Obama:  Just one second, because this is important. This is part of the choice in this election.  When Governor Romney was asked whether teachers -- hiring more teachers was important to growing our economy, Governor Romney said that doesnt grow our economy. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, it was guns here so I need to move us along.  The question was guns so let me -- President Obama:  But this will make a difference in terms of whether or not we can move this economy forward for these young people and reduce our violence. Ms. Crowley:  Okay.  Thank you so much. I want to ask Carol Goldberg to stand up because she gets to a question that both these men have been passionate about.  Its for Governor Romney. Q:  The outsourcing of American jobs overseas has taken a toll on our economy.  What plans do you have to put back and keep jobs here in the United States? Governor Romney:  Boy, great question, an important question because youre absolutely right.  The place where weve seen manufacturing go has been China.  China is now the largest manufacturer in the world -- used to be the United States of America.  A lot of good people have lost jobs.  A half a million manufacturing jobs have been lost in the last four years -- thats total over the last four years.  One of the reasons for that is that people think its more attractive in some cases to go offshore than to stay here.  We have made it less attractive for enterprises to stay here than to go offshore from time to time.  What I will do as President is make sure it's more attractive to come to America again.  This is the way we're going to create jobs in this country.  It's not by trickle-down government, saying we're going to take more money from people and hire more government workers, raise more taxes, put in place more regulations.  Trickle-down government has never worked here, has never worked anywhere.  I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs, for small business, for big business to invest and grow in America.  Now, we're going to have to make sure that as we trade with other nations that they play by the rules, and China hasn't.  One of the reasons -- or one of the ways they don't play by the rules is artificially holding down the value of their currency.  Because if they put their currency down low, that means their prices on their goods are low, and that makes them advantageous in the marketplace.  We lose sales and manufacturers here in the U.S. making the same products can't compete.  China has been a currency manipulator for years and years and years.  And the President has a regular opportunity to label them as a currency manipulator, but refuses to do so.  On day one, I will label China a currency manipulator, which will allow me as President to be able to put in place, if necessary, tariffs where I believe that they are taking unfair advantage of our manufacturers.  So we're going to make sure the people we trade with around the world play by the rules.  But let me not just stop there.  Don't forget what's key to bringing back jobs here is not just finding someone else to punish -- and I'm going to be strict with people who we trade with to make sure they follow the law and play by the rules -- but it's also to make America the most attractive place in the world for businesses of all kinds.  That's why I want to bring down the tax rates on small employers, big employers, so they want to be here. Canada's tax rate on companies is now 15 percent.  Ours is 35 percent.  So if you're starting a business, where would you rather start it?  We have to be competitive if we're going to create more jobs here.  Regulations have quadrupled -- the rate of regulations quadrupled under this President.  I've talked to small businesses across the country.  They say, we feel like we're under attack from our own government.  I want to make sure that regulators see their job as encouraging small business, not crushing it.  And there's no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.  My priority is making sure that we get more people hired.  If we have more people hired, if we get back manufacturing jobs, if we get back all kinds of jobs into this country, then you're going to see rising incomes again.  The reason incomes are down is because unemployment is so high.  I know what it takes to get this to happen.  And my plan will do that.  And one part of it is to make sure that we keep China playing by the rules.  Thank you. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, two minutes here because we are then going to go to our last question.  President Obama:  We need to create jobs here.  And both Governor Romney and I agree actually that we should lower our corporate tax rate.  It's too high.  But there's a difference in terms of how we would do it.  I want to close loopholes that allow companies to deduct expenses when they move to China that allow them to profit offshore and not have to get taxed, so they have tax advantages offshore.  All those changes in our tax code would make a difference.  Now, Governor Romney actually wants to expand those tax breaks.  One of his big ideas when it comes to corporate tax reform would be to say if you invest overseas, you make profits overseas, you don't have to pay U.S. taxes.  But of course, if you're a small business or a mom-and-pop business or a big business starting up here, you've got to pay even the reduced rate that Governor Romney is talking about.  And it's estimated that that will create 800,000 new jobs -- the problem is they'll be in China or India or Germany.  That's not the way we're going to create jobs here.  The way we're going to create jobs here is not just to change our tax code, but also to double our exports.  And we are on pace to double our exports, one of the commitments I made when I was President.  That's creating tens of thousands of jobs all across the country.  That's why we've kept on pushing trade deals, but trade deals that make sure that American workers and American businesses are getting a good deal.  Now, Governor Romney talked about China, as I already indicated.  In the private sector, Governor Romney's company invested in what were called \"pioneers of outsourcing.\"  That's not my phrase.  It's what reporters called it.  And as far as currency manipulation, the currency has actually gone up 11 percent since Ive been President because we have pushed them hard.  And weve put unprecedented trade pressure on China.  That's why exports have significantly increased under my presidency.  That's going to help to create jobs here. Ms. Crowley:  Mr. President, we have a really short time for a quick discussion here.  iPad, the Macs, the iPhones -- they are all manufactured in China.  One of the major reasons is labor is so much cheaper here.  How do you convince a great American company to bring that manufacturing back here? Governor Romney:  The answer is very straightforward:  We can compete with anyone in the world as long as the playing field is level.  China has been cheating over the years -- one, by holding down the value of their currency; number two, by stealing our intellectual property -- our designs, our patents, our technology.  Theres even an Apple store in China that's a counterfeit Apple store selling counterfeit goods.  They hack into our computers.  We will have to have people play on a fair basis.  That's number one. Number two, we have to make America the most attractive place for entrepreneurs, for people who want to expand a business.  That's what brings jobs in.  The Presidents characterization of my tax plan is -- President Obama:  How much time you got, Candy? Governor Romney:  -- is completely -- is completely -- Ms. Crowley:  Let me go to the -- Governor Romney:  -- is completely false.  Let me tell you. Ms. Crowley:  Let me go to the President here because we really are -- President Obama:  All right, Im -- Ms. Crowley:  -- because we really are running out of time. And the question is, can we ever get -- we can't get wages like that.  It can't be sustained here. President Obama:  Candy, there are some jobs that are not going to come back because they're low-wage, low-skill jobs.  I want high-wage, high-skill jobs.  That's why we have to emphasize manufacturing.  That's why we have to invest in advanced manufacturing.  That's why weve got to make sure that weve got the best science and research in the world. And when we talk about deficits, if were adding to our deficit for tax cuts for folks who don't need them, and were cutting investments in research and science that will create the next Apple, create the next new innovation that will sell products around the world, we will lose that race.  If were not training engineers to make sure that they are equipped here in this country, then companies wont come here.  Those investments are whats going to help to make sure that we continue to lead this world economy not just next year, but 10 years from now, 50 years from now, 100 years from now. Ms. Crowley:  Thanks, Mr. President. Governor Romney:  Government does not create jobs. Ms. Crowley:  Governor Romney. Governor Romney:  Government does not create jobs. Ms. Crowley:  Governor Romney, I want to introduce you to Barry Green because hes going to have the last question to you first.  Governor Romney:  Barry?  Oh, theres Barry.  Hi, Barry. Q:  Hi, Governor.  I think this is a tough question.  Each of you, what do you believe is the biggest misperception that the American people have about you as a man and a candidate?  Using specific examples, can you take this opportunity to debunk that misperception and set us straight?", "filename": "17October2012SecondPresidentialCandidateDebatewithMittRomney.txt"}, {"question": "Is it possible for us to join hands in common effort? As citizens of a vibrant and varied democracy, how do we engage in vigorous debate? How does each of us remain firm in our principles, and fight for what we consider right, without, as Father John said, demonizing those with just as strongly held convictions on the other side?", "filename": "18 May 2009\t Notre Dame University Commencement Speech.txt"}, {"question": "And the more who sign up, the stronger the system becomes.  And that's good news for every American who no longer has to worry about being just one illness or accident away from financial hardship. On climate, our early investment in clean energy ignited a clean energy industry boom.  Our actions to help reduce our carbon emissions brought China to the table.  And last week, in Paris, nearly 200 nations forged an historic agreement that was only possible because of American leadership.    Around the world -- from reaching the deal to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, to reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba, to concluding a landmark trade agreement that will make sure that American workers and American businesses are operating on a level playing field and that we, rather than China or other countries, are setting the rules for global trade -- we have shown what is possible when America leads.  And, after decades of dedicated advocacy, marriage equality became a reality in all 50 states.    So, I just want to point out -- I said at the beginning of this year that interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter -- and we are only halfway through. I do want to thank Congress for ending the year on a high note.  I got to sign an education bill that is going to fix some of the challenges that we had with No Child Left Behind, and promises to invest more in high-quality early childhood education.  We signed a transportation bill that, although not as robust as I think we need, still allows states and local governments to plan and actually get moving, putting people back to work rebuilding our roads and our bridges.  We got Ex-Im Bank back to work supporting American exports.   And today they passed a bipartisan budget deal.  Im not wild about everything in it -- Im sure thats true for everybody -- but it is a budget that, as I insisted, invests in our military and our middle class, without ideological provisions that would have weakened Wall Street reform or rules on big polluters.   Its part of an agreement that will permanently extend tax credits to 24 million working families.  It includes some long-sought wins like strengthening Americas leadership at the IMF.  And because it eliminates the possibility of a shutdown for the first time -- or for the first nine months of next year, Congress and I have a long runway to get some important things done on behalf of the American people. Now, theres still a lot of work to do.  For example, theres still a lot more that Congress can do to promote job growth and increase wages in this country.  I still want to work with Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- to reform our criminal justice system.  And earlier today I commuted the sentences of 95 men and women who had served their debt to society, another step forward in upholding our fundamental ideals of justice and fairness.  And, of course, our most important job is to keep Americans safe.  I've had a lot to say about that this week, but let me reiterate, the United States continues to lead a global coalition in our mission to destroy ISIL.  ISIL has already lost about 40 percent of the populated areas it once controlled in Iraq, and its losing territory in Syria.  As we keep up the pressure, our air campaign will continue to hit ISIL harder than ever -- taking out their leaders, their commanders and their forces.  Were stepping up our support for partners on the ground as they push ISIL back.  Our men and women in uniform are carrying out their mission with trademark professionalism and courage.  And this holiday season, all of us are united in our gratitude for their service, and we are thankful to their families, as well, because they serve alongside those who are actually deployed. Squeezing ISILs heart -- its core in Syria and Iraq -- will make it harder for them to pump their terror and propaganda to the rest of the world.  At the same time, as we know from San Bernardino, where Ill visit with families later today, we have to remain vigilant here at home.  Our counterterrorism, intelligence, homeland security, and law enforcement communities are working 24/7 to protect our homeland.  And all of us can do our part by staying vigilant, by saying something if we see something that is suspicious, by refusing to be terrorized, and by staying united as one American family.   In short, for all the very real progress America has made over the past seven years, we still have some unfinished business.  And I plan on doing everything I can with every minute of every day that I have left as President to deliver on behalf of the American people.  Since taking this office, Ive never been more optimistic about a year ahead than I am right now.  And in 2016, Im going to leave it out all on the field.   So with that, let me take some questions.  I'll start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters. Question:  Mr. President, you're going to California today.  And as you said earlier this week, you told the nation that theres no specific or credible threat of a similar attack.  But how is it really possible to know?  I mean, arent similar plots going to be just as hard to detect beforehand?  And some lawmakers are saying that your government should review the social media of all people applying for visas to come to this country.  What do you think of that idea?  Should that be mandatory? President Obama:  Well, Roberta, youre absolutely right that it is very difficult for us to detect lone wolf plots -- or plots involving a husband and wife, in this case -- because despite the incredible vigilance and professionalism of all our law enforcement, homeland security, et cetera, its not that different from us trying to detect the next mass shooter.  You dont always see it.  Theyre not always communicating publicly, and if youre not catching what they say publicly, then it becomes a challenge.   We are continuing to work at every level to make sure that theres no slip between information-sharing among agencies.  Were continuing to strengthen our information-sharing with foreign countries.  And because, in part, of the tragedy in Paris, I think youre seeing much greater cooperation from our European partners on these issues.   But this is a different kind of challenge than the sort that we had with an organization like al Qaeda that involved highly trained operatives who are working as cells or as a network.  Here, essentially, you have ISIL trying to encourage or induce somebody who may be prey to this kind of propaganda.  And it becomes more difficult to see.  It does mean that theyre less likely to be able to carry out large, complex attacks.  But as we saw in San Bernardino, obviously, you can still do enormous damage. The issue of reviewing social media for those who are obtaining visas I think may have gotten garbled a little bit, because there may be -- its important to distinguish between posts that are public -- social media on a Facebook page -- versus private communications through various social media or apps.  And our law enforcement and intelligence professionals are constantly monitoring public posts, and that is part of the visa review process, that people are investigating what individuals have said publicly and questioned about any statements that they maybe made. But if you have a private communication between two individuals, thats harder to discern, by definition.  And one of the things well be doing is engaging with the high-tech community to find out how we can, in an appropriate way, do a better job if we have a lead to be able to track a suspected terrorist.  But were going to have to recognize that no government is going to have the capacity to read every single persons text or emails or social media.  If its not posted publicly, then there are going to be feasibility issues that are probably insurmountable at some level, and it raises questions about our values.   I mean, keep in mind it was only a couple of years ago where we were having a major debate about whether the government was becoming too much like Big Brother.  And overall, I think weve struck the right balance in protecting civil liberties and making sure that U.S. citizens privacy is preserved, that we are making sure that theres oversight to what our intelligence agencies do. But were going to have to continue to balance our needs for security with peoples legitimate concerns about privacy.   And because the Internet is global and communication systems are global, the values that we apply here oftentimes are ones that folks who are trying to come into the country are also benefitting from because theyre using the same technologies.  But this is precisely why were working very hard to bring law enforcement, intelligence, and high-tech companies together.  Because were going to have to really review what we can do both technically as well as consistent with our laws and our values in order to try to discern more rapidly some of the potential threats that may be out there. David Jackson. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  A Gitmo question.  Congress has made it pretty clear that theyre just not going to let you transfer prisoners to the United States for trial.  But some people think you already have the executive authority to transfer those prisoners and close Gitmo itself next year.  My question is, do you believe you have that authority and are you willing to exercise it to close that place? President Obama:  Well, first of all, weve been working systematically -- another example of persistence -- in reducing the population.  We have a review process.  Those who are eligible for transfer we locate in countries that have accepted some of these detainees.  They monitor them, and its been determined that they can be transferred.  And my expectation is by early next year, we should have reduced that population below 100.  And we will continue to steadily chip away at the numbers in Guantanamo. Theres going to come to a point where we have an irreducible population -- people who pose a significant threat, but for various reasons, its difficult for us to try them in an Article III court.  Some of those folks are going through a military commission process.  But theres going to be a challenge there. Now, at that stage, Im presenting a plan to Congress about how we can close Guantanamo.  Im not going to automatically assume that Congress says no.  Im not being coy, David.  I think its fair to say that theres going to be significant resistance from some quarters to that.  But I think we can make a very strong argument that it doesnt make sense for us to be spending an extra $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $500 million, a billion dollars, to have a secure setting for 50, 60, 70 people.  And we will wait until Congress has definitively said no to a well-thought-out plan with numbers attached to it before we say anything definitive about my executive authority here.  I think its far preferable if I can get stuff done with Congress. Question:  So actually you could -- right -- on your own? President Obama:  David, as I said -- and I think youve seen me on a whole bunch of issues like immigration -- Im not going to be forward-leaning on what I can do without Congress before Ive tested what I can do with Congress.  And every once in a while, theyll surprise you, and this may be one of those places -- because I think we can make a really strong argument.  Guantanamo continues to be one of the key magnets for jihadi recruitment.   To Robertas question earlier about how do they propagandize and convince somebody here in the United States who may not have a criminal record or a history of terrorist activity to start shooting -- this is part of what they feed, this notion of a gross injustice, that America is not living up to its professed ideals.  We know that.  We see the Internet traffic.  We see how Guantanamo has been used to create this mythology that America is at war with Islam.  And for us to close it is part of our counterterrorism strategy that is supported by our military, our diplomatic, and our intelligence teams. So when you combine that with the fact that its really expensive that we are essentially at this point detaining a handful of people and each person is costing several million dollars to detain, when there are more efficient ways of doing it, I think we can make a strong argument. But Ill take your point that it will be an uphill battle.  Now, every battle Ive had with Congress over the last five years has been uphill.  But we keep on surprising you by actually getting some stuff done.  Sometimes that may prove necessary, but we try not to get out ahead of ourselves on that. Julie Pace. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask you about some of the broader challenges in the Middle East.  Some of the Republicans who are running for President have argued that the Mideast and the United States would be safer if we hadnt had regime change in places like Iraq, Libya, and Egypt.  And having gone through the experience of the Arab Spring and the aftermath, I wonder what you now see the U.S. role in the Middle East in terms of trying to push dictators out of power.  Would you advise future presidents to call for authoritarian leaders to step down as you did?  And just specifically on Syria, at this point, is it your expectation that Bashar Assads presidency will outlast yours? President Obama:  Theres been a lot of revisionist history, sometimes by the same people making different arguments depending on the situation.  So maybe its useful just for us to go back over some of these issues. We did not depose Hosni Mubarak.  Millions of Egyptians did, because of their dissatisfaction with the corruption and authoritarianism of the regime.  We had a working relationship with Mubarak.  We didn't trigger the Arab Spring.  And the notion that somehow the U.S. was in a position to pull the strings on a country that is the largest in the Arab world I think is mistaken. What is true is that at the point at which the choice becomes mowing down millions of people, or trying to find some transition -- we believed, and I would still argue that it was more sensible for us to find a peaceful transition to the Egyptian situation. With respect to Libya, Libya is sort of a alternative version of Syria in some ways, because by the time the international coalition interceded in Syria, chaos had already broken out.  You already had the makings of a civil war.  You had a dictator who was threatening and was in a position to carry out the wholesale slaughter of large numbers of people.  And we worked under U.N. mandate with a coalition of folks in order to try to avert a big humanitarian catastrophe that would not have been good for us. Those who now argue, in retrospect, we should have left Qaddafi in there seem to forget that he had already lost legitimacy and control of his country, and we could have -- instead of what we have in Libya now, we could have had another Syria in Libya now.  The problem with Libya was the fact that there was a failure on the part of the entire international community -- and I think that the United States has some accountability for not moving swiftly enough and underestimating the need to rebuild government there quickly -- and as a consequence, you now have a very bad situation. And as far as Syria goes, I think it is entirely right and proper for the United States of America to speak out on behalf of its values.  And when you have an authoritarian leader that is killing hundreds of thousands of his own people, the notion that we would just stand by and say nothing is contrary to who we are. And that does not serve our interests -- because, at that point, us being in collusion with that kind of governance would make us even more of a target for terrorist activity, would -- Question:  Do you think that government can cope -- try to stop extremists from -- President Obama:  The reason that Assad has been a problem in Syria is because that is a majority-Sunni country and he had lost the space that he had early on to execute an inclusive transition -- peaceful transition.  He chose instead to slaughter people.  And once that happened, the idea that a minority population there could somehow crush tens of millions of people who oppose him is not feasible.  Its not plausible.  Even if you were being cold-eyed and hard-hearted about the human toll there, it just wouldnt happen.  And as a consequence, our view has been that you cannot bring peace to Syria, you cannot get an end to the civil war unless you have a government that is recognized as legitimate by a majority of that country.  It will not happen.   And this is the argument that Ive had repeatedly with Mr. Putin, dating five years ago, at which time his suggestion -- as I gather some Republicans are now suggesting -- was Assad is not so bad, let him just be as brutal and repressive as he can, but at least hell keep order.  I said, look, the problem is that the history of trying to keep order when a large majority of the country has turned against you is not good.  And five years later, I was right.  So we now have an opportunity -- and John Kerry is meeting as we speak with Syria and Turkey and Iran and the Gulf countries and other parties who are interested -- we now have an opportunity not to turn back the clock -- its going to be very difficult to completely overcome the devastation thats happened in Syria already -- but to find a political transition that maintains the Syrian state, that recognizes there are a bunch of a stakeholders inside of Syria, and hopefully, to initiate a ceasefire that wont be perfect but allows all the parties to turn on what should be our number-one focus, and that is destroying Daesh and its allies in the region.   And that is going to be a difficult process.  Its going to be a painstaking process.  But there is no shortcut to that.  And thats not based on some idealism on my part; thats a hard-headed calculation about whats going to be required to get the job done. Question:  Do you think that Assad, though, potentially could remain in power a year from now? President Obama:  I think that Assad is going to have to leave in order for the country to stop the bloodletting and for all the parties involved to be able to move forward in a non-sectarian way.  He has lost legitimacy in the eyes of a large majority of the country. Now, is there a way of us constructing a bridge creating a political transition that allows those who are allied with Assad right now -- allows the Russians, allows the Iranians to ensure that their equities are respected, that minorities like the Alawites are not crushed or retribution is not the order of the day -- I think thats going to be very important as well. And thats what makes this so difficult.  Sadly, had Assad made a decision earlier that he was not more important personally than his entire country, that kind of political transition would have been much easier.  Its a lot harder now.  But John Kerry has been doing some excellent work in moving that process forward.  And I do think that youve seen from the Russians a recognition that, after a couple of months, theyre not really moving the needle that much, despite a sizeable deployment inside of Syria.  And of course, thats what I suggested would happen -- because theres only so much bombing you can do when an entire country is outraged and believes that its ruler doesnt represent them. Cheryl Bolen. Question:   Thank you, Mr. President.  Id like to ask you about the surprising Congress.  Specifically, what are your top legislative priorities for next year?  And how has the new Speaker, Paul Ryan, changed the dynamic with you and Capitol Hill?  And can you be more ambitious next year, doing things like maybe completing the Transatlantic Trade Partnership, or even getting tax reform? President Obama:  Well, first of all, its important to give some credit where credit is due.  John Boehner did a favor to all of us, including now Speaker Ryan, by working with us to agree on a topline budget framework.  That was the basis for subsequent negotiations.  He was able to do that because he was going out the door, and was then given, I think, a little more room to maneuver than he previously had. Having said that, I also want to give Speaker Ryan credit.  I called both him and Mitch McConnell, as well as Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, for the orderly way in which they actually negotiated a budget -- the way Congress is historically and typically supposed to work.  I mean, weve gotten kind of used to last-minute crises and shutdown threats, and so forth.  And this is a messy process that doesnt satisfy everybody completely, but its more typical of American democracy.  And I think that Speaker Ryan deserves a role in that.   I will say that in his interactions with me, he has been professional, he has reached out to tell me what he can do and what he cannot do.  I think its a good working relationship.  We recognize that we disagree on a whole bunch of other stuff and have fundamentally different visions for where we want to move the country.  But perhaps because even before he was elected he had worked on Capitol Hill, I think he is respectful of the process and respectful of how legislation works.  So kudos to him, as well as all the leaders and appropriators who were involved in this process. Now, I just want to repeat -- because sometimes we take for granted whats happened -- I said early on in this process that I wasnt going to sign a budget that did not relieve sequester, this artificial austerity that was making it difficult for us to invest in things like education and our military.  And I said I would not accept a lot of ideological riders that were attached to a big budget deal.  And we met our goals.   And because of some terrific negotiations by the Democrats up on Capitol Hill and I think some pretty good work by our legislative staff here, were going to be able to fund environmental protection.  Were going to be able to make sure that were investing in things like early childhood education and making college more affordable.  Were going to be able to implement the Clean Power Plan rule.  Were going to be able to continue to invest in clean energy that spurs on innovation.  Were going to be able to make sure that our military gets the equipment and the training that it needs in order to be effective in fighting ISIL and other threats around the world. So it was a good win.  And there are some things in there that I don't like, but that's the nature of legislation and compromise.  And I think the system worked. That gives me some optimism that next year, on a narrow set of issues, we can get some more work done.  Now, as David said, its an election year.  And obviously a lot of the legislative process is going to be skewed by people looking over their shoulders, worrying about primaries, trying to position themselves relative to the presidential candidates.  So that makes it harder.  But I think there are going to be a handful of areas where we can make real progress.   One of them you already mentioned -- Trans-Pacific Partnership, which now has been out, Congress has had a chance to review.  And it meets the bar that I set.  It is consistent with what I promised, which is the most pro-labor, pro-environment, progressive trade deal in history, that eliminates just about every tariff on American manufacturing goods in countries that up until this point have charged a tax, essentially, on anything that American workers and American businesses sell in these areas.  It brings those taxes down to zero on basically all American-manufactured products -- a huge win for agriculture, because now the people of Japan are going to be in a better position to enjoy American beef and American pork, which up until this point, even though we're much more efficient producers, has been tagged with a tax that makes our products uncompetitive in Japanese markets. So this is a big deal.  And I think Speaker Ryan would like to try to get it done.  And there are both proponents and opponents of this in both Democratic and Republican parties, and so its going to be an interesting situation where we're going to have to stitch together the same kind of bipartisan effort in order for us to get it done. A second area that I think is possible is criminal justice reform.  There has been sincere, serious negotiations and efforts by Democrats and Republicans to create a criminal justice system that is more fair, more evenhanded, more proportionate, and is smarter about how we reduce crime.  And Ive really been impressed by the dedication of a core group of Democrats and Republicans -- some of them, the most liberal Democrats and the most conservative Republicans -- coming together saying this is the right thing to do.   Weve got a good bill in the Senate that passed with bipartisan support out of committee.  My hope is, is that gets to the floor, and that we can pair it up with a good bill out of the House.  And this is an area where you potentially can see us save money, reduce recidivism, make sure that people who make a mistake on nonviolent crimes have to pay the price, have to serve time, but are released in a reasonable fashion, that they have more support so that they're less likely to go back into the criminal system subsequently.  And that's an area where I think we may be able to make a big difference. So those are just two examples.  Well keep on looking for a number of examples like that.  And wherever theres an opportunity, Im going to take it. Philip Crowther.  Question:   Thank you, Mr. President.  You mentioned climate change already.  And at the time of the signing of the deal in Paris, you said it was potentially a turning point for the world.  But this was a deal that is not a legally binding document.  And you bypassed Congress pretty much completely.  Are you worried at this point that a Republican president who might take over from you in the White House could stop the deal in its tracks entirely?  And considering that possibility, are you more interested in campaigning for a Democratic nominee, considering that danger? President Obama: I think its fair to say I was going to be campaigning for a Democratic nominee even without that danger.  And I am very confident that we're going to have a terrific Democratic nominee and -- [cellphone rings] -- whose phone is that, guys?  Come on, now. Somebody -- you recognize your ring.  Dont be embarrassed.  Just turn it off.  There you go.  Okay.  Can I still hear it?  I think its off now.  I think we will have a strong Democratic nominee.  I think that Democratic nominee will win.  I think I will have a Democratic successor.  And I will campaign very hard to make that happen -- for a whole variety of reasons -- because they're far more likely to share my fundamental vision about where America should go.   But having said that, what I think people should also feel good about is that the agreement struck in Paris, although not legally binding when it comes to the targets that had been set, does create this architecture in which all around the world, countries are saying, this is where were going.  Were going to be chasing after this clean energy future.  This is how were going to meet our goals.  Were going to double down on solar power.  Were going to double down on wind power.  Were going to invest more heavily in biofuels.  Were going to figure out battery technologies. And what you saw in this budget, which I think was really significant, was an extension of the solar tax credits and wind tax credits that we had helped to really boost early on in my administration and that resulted in wind power increasing threefold, solar power increasing by twentyfold.   Those tax credits are now going to be extended for five to seven years.  And as a consequence, that combination of market signals means that the private sector is going to start investing much more heavily.  They know this is coming.  And its not just coming here -- its coming around the world.  So you now have a global marketplace for clean energy that is stable and accelerating over the course of the next decade.  That then creates a different dynamic that is independent of what Congress does, but also helps to shape what Congress does.  Because the more people that are now getting jobs in solar installation and production, the more that you have companies who are seeing how American innovation can sell products in clean energy all across the Asia Pacific and in Europe and in Africa, suddenly theres a big monetary incentive to getting this right.  And thats been the history of environmental progress in this country, and now weve exported it around the world.  Every time weve made a decision, you know what, were going to have clean air, the predictions were everything would fall apart.  And lo and behold, it turns out that American innovation makes getting clean air a lot less expensive than people expected and it happens a lot faster than expected.   When we made a decision that we were going to double fuel-efficiency standards on cars, everybody said, oh, this is going to ruin the American auto industry.  The American auto industry has been booming over the last couple years.  Acid rain -- when George H.W. Bush instituted a system to charge for the emissions that were causing acid rain, everybody said, well, you cant do that, thats going to ruin business.  And it turned out it was smoother, faster, quicker, better.  And acid rain folks who were born -- I dont know -- some of you reporters are getting younger, or Im getting older -- may not remember it, but that was a big deal.  Now most folks dont even remember it anymore, because it got solved.  And theres no reason why the same wont happen here. Now, do I think that theres going to be a lot of noise and campaigning next year about how were going to stop Paris in its tracks?  There will probably be a lot of noise like that.  Do I actually think that, two years from now, three years from now, even Republican members of Congress are going to look at it and say, thats a smart thing to do?  I dont think they will. Keep in mind that, right now, the American Republican Party is the only major party that I can think of in the advanced world that effectively denies climate change.  I mean, its an outlier. Many of the key signatories to this deal, the architects of this deal come from center-right governments.  Even the far-right parties in many of these countries -- they may not like immigrants, for example, but they admit, yes, the science tells us weve got to do something about climate change.   So my sense is, is that this is something that may be an advantage in terms of short-term politics and a Republican primary.  Its not something that is going to be a winner for Republicans long term. Question:   You mentioned American leadership.  Is it embarrassing to you that the other party denies climate change? President Obama:  No -- because, first of all, Im not a member of that party.  Second of all, it didnt stop us from being the key leader in getting this done. I mean, this is something Ive been working on now for five, six years. When I went to Copenhagen, I essentially engaged in 24 hours of diplomacy to salvage from a pretty chaotic process the basic principle that all countries had to participate, that we couldnt have a rigid division between developed countries and developing countries when it came to solving this problem.  That was the initial foundation for us then working with other countries, culminating in the joint announcement with China, bringing in India, bringing in Brazil and the other big, emerging countries, working with the Europeans and getting this done. This would not have happened without American leadership.  And, by the way, the same is true for the Iran nuclear deal.  The same is true for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  The same is true for stamping out Ebola -- something, you guys may recall from last year, which was the potential end of the world.   At each juncture, what weve said is, is that American strength and American exceptionalism is not just a matter of us bombing somebody.  More often, its a matter of us convening, setting the agenda, pointing other nations in a direction thats good for everybody and good for U.S. interests, engaging in painstaking diplomacy, leading by example.  And sometimes the results dont come overnight, they dont come the following day, but they come. And this year, what you really saw was that steady, persistent leadership on many initiatives that I began when I first came into office. All right.  Ive got April Ryan. Question:   Mr. President, I want to ask you something on criminal justice, or that something you said also -- something from Julie Pace.  Your administration contends the United States is 5 percent of the world population, but 25 percent of the global jailed population.  What legislation are you supporting that significantly cuts mass incarceration in this country?  And going back to the Assad issue, does Assad have to go to defeat ISIS? President Obama:  Well, were going to defeat ISIS, and were going to do so by systematically squeezing them, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing, taking out their leadership, taking out their forces, taking out their infrastructure.  Were going to do so in partnership with forces on the ground -- that sometimes are spotty, sometimes need capacity-building, need our assistance, need our training -- but were seeing, steadily, progress in many of these areas.  And so theyre going to be on the run. Now, they are going to continue to be dangerous.  So let me just be very clear -- because whenever I say that we have made progress in squeezing the territory that they control, or made real inroads against them, what people will say is, well, if something happens around the world, then obviously that must not be true.  But in any battle, in any fight, even as you make progress, there are still dangers involved.  And ISILs capacity both to infiltrate Western countries with people whove traveled to Syria or traveled to Iraq, and the savviness of their social media, their ability to recruit disaffected individuals who may be French or British or even U.S. citizens, will continue to make them dangerous for quite some time.  But we will systematically go after them. Now, in order for us to stamp them out thoroughly, we have to eliminate lawless areas in which they cannot still roam.  So we can disable them, we can dismantle much of their infrastructure, greatly reduce the threat that they pose to the United States, our allies and our neighbors.  But, in the same way that al Qaeda is pinned down and has much more difficulty carrying out any significant attacks because of how weve systematically dismantled them, they still pose a threat.  There are still operatives who are interested in carrying out terrorist attacks because they still operate in areas between Pakistan and Afghanistan, or more prominently right now, in Yemen, that are hard to reach. Our long-term goal has to be able to stabilize these areas so that they dont have any safe haven.  And in order for us to do that in Syria, there has to be an end to the civil war, and there has to be an actual government that has a police capacity and a structure in these areas that currently arent governed.  And it is my firm belief and the belief of the experts in this administration, that so long as Assad is there, we cannot achieve that kind of stability inside of Syria.  And I think the history over the last several years indicates as much.   So thats going to continue to be a top priority for us, moving aggressively on the military track and not letting ISIL take a breath, and pounding away at them with our Special Forces and our airstrikes, and the training and advising of partners who can go after them.  But we also have to keep very aggressive on this diplomatic track in order for us to bring countries together. All right?  Everybody -- Question:  On criminal justice -- President Obama:  Oh, on criminal justice reform, I answered the question.  Im hopeful -- Question:   On the legislation -- are you supporting the -- mass incarceration?", "filename": "18December2015EndofYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Let me begin by thanking Harris Wofford for his contributions to this country. In so many different ways, he exemplifies what we mean by the word \"citizen.\" And so we are very grateful to him for all the work he has done; and I'm thankful for the gracious and thoughtful introduction. \"We the people, in order to form a more perfect union.\" Two hundred and twenty one years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and, with these simple words, launched America's improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers and scholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across the ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their Declaration of Independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787. The document they produced was eventually signed, but ultimately unfinished. It was stained by this nation's original sin of slavery, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations. Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution -- a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time. And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part -- through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk -- to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. This was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign: to continue the long march of those who came before us, a march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring, and more prosperous America. I chose to run for President at this moment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes; that we may not look the same and may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction: towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren. And this belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people. But it also comes from my own story. I'm the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's army during World War II, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while he was overseas. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and I've lived in one of the world's poorest nations. I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles, and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents. And for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible. It's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional of candidates. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many, we are truly one. Now throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the American people were for this message of unity. Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina, where the Confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African Americans and white Americans. This is not to say that race has not been an issue in this campaign. At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either \"too black\" or \"not black enough.\" We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The press has scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well. And yet, it's only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn. On one end of the spectrum, we've heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it's based solely on the desire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On the other end, we've heard my former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation and that rightly offend white and black alike. Now I've already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy, and in some cases, pain. For some, nagging questions remain: Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in the church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely, just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagree. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren't simply controversial. They weren't simply a religious leader's efforts to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country, a view that sees white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam. As such, Reverend Wright's comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems: two wars, a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis, and potentially devastating climate change -- problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all. Given my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough.

Why not join another church?", "filename": "18March2008AMorePerfectUnionSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "What they like to talk about is the politics of the vote.  What does this mean in November?

And tonight, because of their determined efforts, we've closed an important chapter in this tragedy. I've been briefed earlier this evening by FBI Director Mueller.  After the attacks on Monday, I directed the full resources of the federal government to be made available to help state and local authorities in the investigation and to increase security as needed.  Over the past week, close coordination among federal, state, and local officials -- sharing information, moving swiftly to track down leads -- has been critical to this effort. They all worked as they should, as a team.  And we are extremely grateful for that.  We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all our outstanding law enforcement professionals.  These men and women get up every day, they put on that uniform; they risk their lives to keep us safe -- and as this week showed, they don't always know what to expect.  So our thoughts are with those who were wounded in pursuit of the suspects and we pray for their full recovery. We also send our prayers to the Collier family who grieve the loss of their son and brother, Sean.  \"He was born to be a police officer,\" said his chief at MIT.  He was just 26 years old.  And as his family has said, he died bravely in the line of duty, doing what he committed his life to doing -- serving and protecting others.  So we're grateful to him. Obviously, tonight there are still many unanswered questions.  Among them, why did young men who grew up and studied here, as part of our communities and our country, resort to such violence?  How did they plan and carry out these attacks, and did they receive any help?", "filename": "19April2013ThirdStatementonBostonMarathonBombings.txt"}, {"question": "Its now been five days since the heartbreaking tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut; three days since we gathered as a nation to pray for the victims. And today, a few more of the 20 small children and six educators who were taken from us will be laid to rest. We may never know all the reasons why this tragedy happened. We do know that every day since, more Americans have died of gun violence.  We know such violence has terrible consequences for our society.  And if there is even one thing that we can do to prevent any of these events, we have a deep obligation -- all of us -- to try. Over these past five days, a discussion has reemerged as to what we might do not only to deter mass shootings in the future, but to reduce the epidemic of gun violence that plagues this country every single day.  And its encouraging that people of all different backgrounds and beliefs and political persuasions have been willing to challenge some old assumptions and change longstanding positions. That conversation has to continue.  But this time, the words need to lead to action. We know this is a complex issue that stirs deeply held passions and political divides.  And as I said on Sunday night, theres no law or set of laws that can prevent every senseless act of violence in our society.  Were going to need to work on making access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun.  Were going to need to look more closely at a culture that all too often glorifies guns and violence.  And any actions we must take must begin inside the home and inside our hearts. But the fact that this problem is complex can no longer be an excuse for doing nothing.  The fact that we cant prevent every act of violence doesnt mean we cant steadily reduce the violence, and prevent the very worst violence. Thats why Ive asked the Vice President to lead an effort that includes members of my Cabinet and outside organizations to come up with a set of concrete proposals no later than January -- proposals that I then intend to push without delay.  This is not some Washington commission.  This is not something where folks are going to be studying the issue for six months and publishing a report that gets read and then pushed aside.  This is a team that has a very specific task, to pull together real reforms right now.  I asked Joe to lead this effort in part because he wrote the 1994 Crime Bill that helped law enforcement bring down the rate of violent crime in this country.  That plan -- That bill also included the assault weapons ban that was publicly supported at the time by former Presidents including Ronald Reagan. The good news is theres already a growing consensus for us to build from.  A majority of Americans support banning the sale of military-style assault weapons.  A majority of Americans support banning the sale of high-capacity ammunition clips.  A majority of Americans support laws requiring background checks before all gun purchases, so that criminals cant take advantage of legal loopholes to buy a gun from somebody who wont take the responsibility of doing a background check at all. I urge the new Congress to hold votes on these measures next year in a timely manner.  And considering Congress hasnt confirmed a director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in six years -- the agency that works most closely with state and local law enforcement to keep illegal guns out of the hands of criminals -- Id suggest that they make this a priority early in the year. Look, like the majority of Americans, I believe that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to bear arms.  This country has a strong tradition of gun ownership thats been handed down from generation to generation.  Obviously across the country there are regional differences.  There are differences between how people feel in urban areas and rural areas.  And the fact is the vast majority of gun owners in America are responsible -- they buy their guns legally and they use them safely, whether for hunting or sport shooting, collection or protection. But you know what, I am also betting that the majority -- the vast majority -- of responsible, law-abiding gun owners would be some of the first to say that we should be able to keep an irresponsible, law-breaking few from buying a weapon of war.  Im willing to bet that they dont think that using a gun and using common sense are incompatible ideas -- that an unbalanced man shouldnt be able to get his hands on a military-style assault rifle so easily; that in this age of technology, we should be able to check someones criminal records before he or she can check out at a gun show; that if we work harder to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like the one in Newtown -- or any of the lesser-known tragedies that visit small towns and big cities all across America every day. Since Friday morning, a police officer was gunned down in Memphis, leaving four children without their mother.  Two officers were killed outside a grocery store in Topeka.  A woman was shot and killed inside a Las Vegas casino.  Three people were shot inside an Alabama hospital.  A four-year-old was caught in a drive-by in Missouri, and taken off life support just yesterday. Each one of these Americans was a victim of the everyday gun violence that takes the lives of more than 10,000 Americans every year -- violence that we cannot accept as routine. So I will use all the powers of this office to help advance efforts aimed at preventing more tragedies like this.  We wont prevent them all -- but that cant be an excuse not to try.  It wont be easy -- but that can't be an excuse not to try. And I'm not going to be able to do it by myself.  Ultimately if this effort is to succeed its going to require the help of the American people -- its going to require all of you.  If we're going to change things, its going to take a wave of Americans -- mothers and fathers, daughters and sons, pastors, law enforcement, mental health professionals -- and, yes, gun owners -- standing up and saying enough on behalf of our kids. It will take commitment and compromise, and most of all, it will take courage.  But if those of us who were sent here to serve the public trust can summon even one tiny iota of the courage those teachers, that principal in Newtown summoned on Friday -- if cooperation and common sense prevail -- then Im convinced we can make a sensible, intelligent way to make the United States of America a safer, stronger place for our children to learn and to grow. Thank you.  And now I'm going to let the Vice President go and I'm going to take a few questions.  And I will start with Ben Feller. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I'd like to ask you about the other serious issue consuming this town right now, the fiscal cliff. President Obama:  Right. Question:  Havent you betrayed some of the voters who supported you in the election by changing your positions on who should get a tax increase and by including Social Security benefits now in this mix?  And more broadly, there seems to be a deepening sense that negotiations aren't going very well right now.  Can you give us a candid update?  Are we likely to go over the cliff? President Obama:  Well, first of all, there's no reason why we should.  Remember what I said during the campaign.  I thought that it was important for us to reduce our deficit in a balanced and responsible way.  I said it was important for us to make sure that millionaires and billionaires paid their fair share.  I said that we were going to have to make some tough cuts, some tough decisions on the spending side, but what I wouldn't do was hurt vulnerable families only to pay for a tax cut for somebody like me.  And what I said was that the ultimate package would involve a balance of spending cuts and tax increases. That's exactly what I've put forward.  What I've said is, is that in order to arrive at a compromise, I am prepared to do some very tough things -- some things that some Democrats don't want to see and probably there are a few Republicans who don't want to see either.  But the only way that we're going to be able to stabilize the economy, make sure we've got a platform for long-term economic growth, that we get our deficits under control and we make sure that middle-class families are protected is if we come up with something that members of both parties in Congress can support. And that's the plan that I've put forward.  I have gone at least halfway in meeting some of the Republicans' concerns, recognizing that even though we campaigned on these issues, even though the majority of Americans agree with me that we should be raising taxes on the wealthiest few as a means of reducing the deficit, I have also said that I'm willing to identify some spending cuts that make sense. And, frankly, up until about a couple of days ago, if you looked at it, the Republicans in the House and Speaker Boehner I think were in a position to say, we've gotten a fair deal.  The fact that they haven't taken it yet is puzzling and I think a question that you're going to have to address to them. I remain optimistic, though, because if you look at what the Speaker has proposed, he's conceded that income tax rates should go up -- except right now he only wants to have them go up for millionaires.  If you're making $900,000, somehow he thinks that you can't afford to pay a little more in taxes.  But the principle that rates are going to need to go up he's conceded. I've said I'm willing to make some cuts.  What separates us is probably a few hundred billion dollars.  The idea that we would put our economy at risk because you can't bridge that gap doesnt make a lot of sense. So I'm going to continue to talk to the Speaker and the other leaders up in Congress.  But, ultimately, they've got to do their job.  Right now their job is to make sure that middle-class taxes do not go up and that we have a balanced, responsible package of deficit reduction. It is there for all to see.  It is a deal that can get done. But it is not going to be -- it cannot be done if every side wants 100 percent.  And part of what voters were looking for is some compromise up here.  Thats what folks want.  They understand that they're not going to get 100 percent of what they want.  And for some reason, that message has not yet taken up on Capitol Hill. And when you think about what we've gone through over the last couple of months -- a devastating hurricane, and now one of the worst tragedies in our memory -- the country deserves folks to be willing to compromise on behalf of the greater good, and not tangle themselves up in a whole bunch of ideological positions that dont make much sense. So I remain not only open to conversations, but I remain eager to get something done.  I'd like to get it done before Christmas.  There's been a lot of posturing up on Capitol Hill, instead of just going ahead and getting stuff done.  And we've been wasting a lot of time.  It is the right thing to do.  I'm prepared to get it done.  But they're going to have to go ahead and make some adjustments. And I'll just give you one other example.  The Speaker now is proposing what he calls plan B.  So he says, well, this would raise taxes only on folks making a million dollars or more.  What that means is an average of a $50,000 tax break for every millionaire out there, at the same time as we're not providing unemployment insurance for 2 million people who are still out there looking for work.  It actually means a tax increase for millions of working families across the country at the same time as folks like me would be getting a tax break.  That violates the core principles that were debated during the course of this election and that the American people determined was the wrong way to go. And so my hope is, is that the Speaker and his caucus, in conjunction with the other legislative leaders up there, can find a way to make sure that middle-class families dont see their taxes go up on January 1st; that we make sure that those things that middle-class families count on like tax credits for college, or making sure that theyre getting some help when it comes to raising their kids through things like the child tax credit, that that gets done; and that we have a balanced package for deficit reduction, which is exactly what Ive put forward. Question:  Will you give more ground if you need to, or are you done? President Obama:  If you look at the package that I put forward, it is a balanced package by any definition.  We have put forward real cuts in spending that are hard to do, in every category.  And by any measure, by any traditional calculation, by the measures that Republicans themselves have used in the past, this would be as large a piece of deficit reduction as weve seen in the last 20 years.  And if you combine that with the increased revenue from the wealthy paying a little bit more, then you actually have something that would stabilize our deficit and debt for a decade -- for 10 years. Now, the notion that we would not do that, but instead the Speaker would run a play that keeps tax cuts for folks making $500,000 or $700,000 or $800,000 or $900,000 a year, and gives more tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, and raises taxes on middle-class families, and then has no cuts in it -- which is what he says he wants -- doesnt make much sense. I mean, lets just think about the logic for a second.  Theyre thinking about voting for raising taxes at least on folks over a million, which they say they dont want to do, but theyre going to reject spending cuts that they say they do want to do.  That defies logic.  Theres no explanation for that. I think that any objective person out there looking would say that weve put forward a very balanced plan and its time for us to go ahead and get it done.  Thats what the country needs right now.  Because I think folks have been through some wrenching times, were still recovering from a very tough recession, and what theyre hoping for is a sense of stability, focus, compromise, common sense over the next couple of years.  And I think we can provide it.  But this is a good test for them. Carol Lee. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Just to follow on Ben's question, what is your next move?  Are we in a position now where you're just waiting for the Speaker to make a move? President Obama:  Well, I'm going to reach out to all the leaders involved over the next couple of days and find out what is it that's holding this thing up.  What is holding it up?  If the argument from Republicans is we haven't done enough spending cuts, that argument is not going to fly because we've got close to a trillion dollars of spending cuts.  And when you add interest, then it's more than a trillion dollars in spending cuts. If the argument is that they can't do -- they can't increase tax rates on folks making $700,000 or $800,000 a year, that's not a persuasive argument to me and it's certainly not a persuasive argument to the American people. It may be that members of their caucus haven't looked at exactly what we've proposed.  It may be that if we provide more information or there's greater specificity or we work through some of their concerns, that we can get some movement then. But the fact of the matter is, is that what would violate my commitment to voters is if I ended up agreeing to a plan that put more of the burden on middle-class families and less of a burden on the wealthy in an effort to reduce our deficit.  That's not something I'm going to do.  What would violate my commitment to voters would be to put forward a plan that makes it harder for young people to go to college, that makes it harder for a family with a disabled kid to care for that kid. And there's a threshold that you reach where the balance tips, even in making compromises that are required to get something done in this town, where you are hurting people in order to give another advantage to folks who don't need help.  And we had an extensive debate about this for a year.  And not only does the majority of the American people agree with me, about half of Republican voters agree with me on this. So at some point, there's got to be I think a recognition on the part of my Republican friends that -- take the deal.  They will be able to claim that they have worked with me over the last two years to reduce the deficit more than any other deficit reduction package; that we will have stabilized it for 10 years. That is a significant achievement for them.  They should be proud of it.  But they keep on finding ways to say no, as opposed to finding ways to say yes. And I dont know how much of that just has to do with -- it is very hard for them to say yes to me.  But at some point, theyve got to take me out of it and think about their voters, and think about whats best for the country.  And if they do that -- if theyre not worried about whos winning and whos losing, did they score a point on the President, did they extract that last little concession, did they force him to do something he really doesnt want to do just for the heck of it, and they focus on actually whats good for the country, I actually think we can get this done. Question:   You mentioned the $700,000 and $800,000.  Are you willing to move on income level and are there specific things that you would do -- President Obama:  Im not going to get into specific negotiations here.  My point is simple, Carol, that if you look at Speaker Boehners proposal and you look at my proposal, theyre actually pretty close.  They keep on saying that somehow we havent put forward real spending cuts. Actually, there was I think a graph in The New York Times today that showed -- theyre the same categories, right?  Theres a little bit of tweaks here and there; there are a few differences, but were right there. And on the revenue side, theres a difference in terms of them wanting to preserve tax breaks for folks between $250,000 and a million that we just cant afford.  I mean, keep in mind Im in that income category; Id love to not pay as much in taxes.  But I also think its the right thing to do for us to make sure that people who have less -- people who are working, people who are striving, people who are hoping for their kids -- that they have opportunity.  Thats what we campaigned about.  Thats what we talked about. And this is not a situation where Im unwilling to compromise.  This is not a situation where Im trying to rub their face in anything.  I think anybody who looks at this objectively would say that coming off my election, I have met them at least halfway in order to get something done for the country. And so I noticed that there were a couple of headlines out there saying, oh, were now in the land of political posturing, and its the usual he said-he said atmosphere.  But look at the facts.  Look at where we started; look at where they started.  My proposal is right there in the middle. We should be able to get this done.  Lets get it done.  We dont have a lot of time. Carrie.  Wheres -- there you are. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama:  Yes. Question:  What is your level of confidence that if you are able to reach a comprehensive deal with the Speaker, that he will be able to bring his members onboard and get it passed?  Essentially, do you still trust Speaker Boehner in this process? President Obama:  There is no doubt that the Speaker has challenges in his caucus, and I recognize that.  Im often reminded when I speak to the Republican leadership that the majority of their caucuss membership come from districts that I lost.  And so sometimes they may not see an incentive in cooperating with me, in part because theyre more concerned about challenges from a tea party candidate, or challenges from the right, and cooperating with me may make them vulnerable.  I recognize that. But, goodness, if this past week has done anything, it should just give us some perspective.  If theres one thing we should have after this week, it should be a sense of perspective about whats important.  And I would like to think that members of that caucus would say to themselves:  You know what, we disagree with the President on a whole bunch of things.  We wish the other guy had won.  Were going to fight him on a whole range of issues over the next four years.  We think his philosophy is all screwed up.  But right now, what the country needs is for us to compromise, get a deficit reduction deal in place; make sure middle class taxes dont go up; make sure that were laying the foundations for growth; give certainty to businesses large and small; not put ourselves through some sort of self-inflicted crisis every six months; allow ourselves time to focus on things like preventing the tragedy in Newtown from happening again; focus on issues like energy and immigration reform and all the things that will really make a determination as to whether our country grows over the next four years, 10 years, 40 years. And if you just pull back from the immediate political battles, if you kind of peel off the partisan war paint, then we should be able to get something done. And I think the Speaker would like to get that done.  I think an environment needs to be created within not just the House Republican caucus, but also among Senate Republicans that say, the campaign is over and lets see if we can do whats right for the country -- at least for the next month.  And then we can reengage in all the other battles that theyll want to fight. Question:  If you dont get it done, Republicans have said theyll try to use the debt limit as a next pressure point.  Would you negotiate with them in that context? President Obama:  No.  And Ive been very clear about this.  This is the United States of America, the greatest country on Earth, the worlds economic superpower.  And the idea that we lurch from crisis to crisis, and every six months, or every nine months, that we threaten not to pay our bills on stuff weve already bought, and default, and ruin the full faith and credit of the United States of America -- thats not how you run a great country. So Ive put forward a very clear principle:  I will not negotiate around the debt ceiling.  Were not going to play the same game that we saw happen in 2011 -- which was hugely destructive; hurt our economy; provided more uncertainty to the business community than anything else that happened. And I'm not alone in this.  If you go to Wall Street, including talking to a whole bunch of folks who spent a lot of money trying to beat me, they would say it would be disastrous for us to use the debt ceiling as a cudgel to try to win political points on Capitol Hill. So we're not going to do that -- which is why I think that part of what I hope over the next couple of days we see is a recognition that there is a way to go ahead and get what it is that you've been fighting for.  These guys have been fighting for spending cuts.  They can get some very meaningful spending cuts. This would amount to $2 trillion -- $2 trillion -- in spending cuts over the last couple of years.  And in exchange, they're getting a little over a trillion dollars in revenue.  And that meets the pledge that I made during the campaign, which was $2 to $2.50 of spending cuts for every revenue increase.  And that's an approach that I think most Americans think is appropriate. But I will not negotiate around the debt ceiling.  We're not going to do that again. Question:  Sir, may I ask a question about Newtown, please? President Obama:  Yes, I've got David Jackson. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Getting back to the gun issue, you alluded to the fact that Washington commissions don't have the greatest reputation in the world.  What makes you think this one is going to be different given the passage of time and the political power of gun rights groups like the National Rifle Association? President Obama:  Well, this is not going to be a commission. Joe is going to gather up some key Cabinet members who have an interest in this issue.  We're going to reach out to a bunch of stakeholders.  We're going to be reaching out to members of Congress who have an interest in this issue.  It's not as if we have to start from scratch.  There are a whole bunch of proposals that have been thought about, debated, but hopefully also some new ideas in terms of how we deal with this issue. Their task is going to be to sift through every good idea that's out there, and even take a look at some bad ideas before disposing of them, and come up with a concrete set of recommendations in about a month.  And I would hope that our memories aren't so short that what we saw in Newtown isn't lingering with us, that we don't remain passionate about it only a month later. And as soon as we get those recommendations, I will be putting forward very specific proposals.  I will be talking about them in my State of The Union and we will be working with interested members of Congress to try to get some of them done. And the idea that we would say this is terrible, this is a tragedy, never again, and we dont have the sustained attention span to be able to get this done over the next several months doesnt make sense.  I have more confidence in the American people than that.  I have more confidence in the parents, the mothers and fathers that Ive been meeting over the last several days all across the country from all political persuasions, including a lot of gun owners, who say, you know what, this time weve got to do things differently. Question:  What about the NRA? President Obama:  Well, the NRA is an organization that has members who are mothers and fathers.  And I would expect that theyve been impacted by this as well. And hopefully theyll do some self-reflection. And heres what we know -- that any single gun law cant solve all these problems.  Were going to have to look at mental health issues.  Were going to have to look at schools.  There are going to be a whole range of things that Joes group looks at.  We know that issues of gun safety will be an element of it. And what weve seen over the last 20 years, 15 years, is the sense that anything related to guns is somehow an encroachment on the Second Amendment.  What were looking for here is a thoughtful approach that says we can preserve our Second Amendment, we can make sure that responsible gun owners are able to carry out their activities, but that were going to actually be serious about the safety side of this; that were going to be serious about making sure that something like Newtown or Aurora doesnt happen again. And there is a big chunk of space between what the Second Amendment means and having no rules at all.  And that space is what Joe is going to be working on to try to identify where we can find some common ground. So Ive got -- Im going to take one last question. Go ahead, Jake. Question:  It seems to a lot of observers that you made the political calculation in 2008 in your first term and in 2012 not to talk about gun violence.  You had your position on renewing the ban on semiautomatic rifles that then-Senator Biden put into place, but you didnt do much about it.  This is not the first issue -- the first incident of horrific gun violence of your four years.  Where have you been?", "filename": "19December2012EndYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "In last years final press conference, I said that 2014 would be a year of action and would be a breakthrough year for America.  And it has been.  Yes, there were crises that we had to tackle around the world, many that were unanticipated.  We have more work to do to make sure our economy, our justice system, and our government work not just for the few, but for the many.  But there is no doubt that we can enter into the New Year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts. The steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and rebuild it on a new foundation helped make 2014 the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s.  All told, over a 57-month streak, our businesses have created nearly 11 million new jobs.  Almost all the job growth that weve seen have been in full-time positions.  Much of the recent pickup in job growth has been in higher-paying industries.  And in a hopeful sign for middle-class families, wages are on the rise again. Our investments in American manufacturing have helped fuel its best stretch of job growth also since the 1990s.  America is now the number-one producer of oil, the number-one producer of natural gas.  We're saving drivers about 70 cents a gallon at the pump over last Christmas.  And effectively today, our rescue of the auto industry is officially over.  We've now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my Administration committed, and the American auto industry is on track for its strongest year since 2005.  And we've created about half a million new jobs in the auto industry alone. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance just this past year.  Enrollment is beginning to pick up again during the open enrollment period.  The uninsured rate is at a near record low.  Since the law passed, the price of health care has risen at its slowest rate in about 50 years.  And weve cut our deficits by about two-thirds since I took office, bringing them to below their 40-year average. Meanwhile, around the world, America is leading.  Were leading the coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL -- a coalition that includes Arab partners.  Were leading the international community to check Russian aggression in Ukraine. We are leading the global fight to combat Ebola in West Africa, and we are preventing an outbreak from taking place here at home. Were leading efforts to address climate change, including last months joint announcement with China thats already jumpstarting new progress in other countries.  Were writing a new chapter in our leadership here in the Americas by turning a new page on our relationship with the Cuban people. And in less than two weeks, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over.  Today, more of our troops are home for the holidays than any time in over a decade. Still, many of our men and women in uniform will spend Christmas in harms way.  And they should know that the country is united in support of you and grateful not only to you but also to your families. The six years since the crisis have demanded hard work and sacrifice on everybodys part.  But as a country, we have every right to be proud of what weve accomplished -- more jobs; more people insured; a growing economy; shrinking deficits; bustling industry; booming energy.  Pick any metric that you want -- Americas resurgence is real.  We are better off. Ive always said that recovering from the crisis of 2008 was our first order of business, and on that business, America has outperformed all of our other competitors.  Over the past four years, weve put more people back to work than all other advanced economies combined.  Weve now come to a point where we have the chance to reverse an even deeper problem, the decades-long erosion of middle-class jobs and incomes, and to make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers our prosperity for decades to come. To do that, we're going to have to make some smart choices; we've got to make the right choices.  We're going to have to invest in the things that secure even faster growth in higher-paying jobs for more Americans.  And Im being absolutely sincere when I say I want to work with this new Congress to get things done, to make those investments, to make sure the government is working better and smarter.  We're going to disagree on some things, but there are going to be areas of agreement and we've got to be able to make that happen.  And that's going to involve compromise every once in a while, and we saw during this lame duck period that perhaps that spirit of compromise may be coming to the fore.   In terms of my own job, I'm energized, I'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years, and I'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute in the effort to make life better for ordinary Americans.  Because, thanks to their efforts, we really do have a new foundation that's been laid.  We are better positioned than we have been in a very long time.  A new future is ready to be written.  We've set the stage for this American moment.  And I'm going to spend every minute of my last two years making sure that we seize it. My presidency is entering the fourth quarter; interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter.  And I'm looking forward to it.  But going into the fourth quarter, you usually get a timeout.  I'm now looking forward to a quiet timeout -- Christmas with my family.  So I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas, a Happy Hanukkah, a Happy New Year.  I hope that all of you get some time to spend with your families as well, because one thing that we share is that we're away too much from them.  And now, Josh has given me the whos been naughty and whos been nice list -- and I'm going to use it to take some questions.  And we're going to start with Carrie Budoff Brown of Politico.  There you go, Carrie. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Ill start on North Korea -- that seems to be the biggest topic today.  What does a proportional response look like to the Sony hack?  And did Sony make the right decision in pulling the movie?  Or does that set a dangerous precedent when faced with this kind of situation?   President Obama:  Well, let me address the second question first.  Sony is a corporation.  It suffered significant damage.  There were threats against its employees.  I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced.  Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake. In this interconnected, digital world, there are going to be opportunities for hackers to engage in cyber assaults both in the private sector and the public sector.  Now, our first order of business is making sure that we do everything to harden sites and prevent those kinds of attacks from taking place.  When I came into office, I stood up a cybersecurity interagency team to look at everything that we could at the government level to prevent these kinds of attacks.  Weve been coordinating with the private sector, but a lot more needs to be done.  Were not even close to where we need to be. And one of the things in the New Year that I hope Congress is prepared to work with us on is strong cybersecurity laws that allow for information-sharing across private sector platforms, as well as the public sector, so that we are incorporating best practices and preventing these attacks from happening in the first place. But even as we get better, the hackers are going to get better, too.  Some of them are going to be state actors; some of them are going to be non-state actors.  All of them are going to be sophisticated and many of them can do some damage. We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States.  Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they dont like, or news reports that they dont like.  Or even worse, imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they dont want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended. So thats not who we are.  Thats not what America is about. Again, Im sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liabilities, and this and that and the other.  I wish they had spoken to me first.  I would have told them, do not get into a pattern in which youre intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks.  Imagine if, instead of it being a cyber-threat, somebody had broken into their offices and destroyed a bunch of computers and stolen disks.  Is that what it takes for suddenly you to pull the plug on something? So well engage with not just the film industry, but the news industry and the private sector around these issues.  We already have.  We will continue to do so.  But I think all of us have to anticipate occasionally there are going to be breaches like this.  Theyre going to be costly.  Theyre going to be serious.  We take them with the utmost seriousness.  But we cant start changing our patterns of behavior any more than we stop going to a football game because there might be the possibility of a terrorist attack; any more than Boston didnt run its marathon this year because of the possibility that somebody might try to cause harm.  So lets not get into that way of doing business. Question:  Can you just say what the response would be to this attack?  Wwould you consider taking some sort of symbolic step like watching the movie yourself or doing some sort of screening here that -- President Obama:  Ive got a long list of movies Im going to be watching. Question:  Will this be one of them? President Obama:  I never release my full movie list. But lets talk of the specifics of what we now know.  The FBI announced today and we can confirm that North Korea engaged in this attack.  I think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state mount an all-out assault on a movie studio because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco [Franco]. I love Seth and I love James, but the notion that that was a threat to them I think gives you some sense of the kind of regime were talking about here. They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond.  We will respond proportionally, and well respond in a place and time and manner that we choose.  Its not something that I will announce here today at a press conference. More broadly, though, this points to the need for us to work with the international community to start setting up some very clear rules of the road in terms of how the Internet and cyber operates.  Right now, its sort of the Wild West.  And part of the problem is, is youve got weak states that can engage in these kinds of attacks, youve got non-state actors that can do enormous damage.  Thats part of what makes this issue of cybersecurity so urgent. Again, this is part of the reason why its going to be so important for Congress to work with us and get a actual bill passed that allows for the kind of information-sharing we need.  Because if we dont put in place the kind of architecture that can prevent these attacks from taking place, this is not just going to be affecting movies, this is going to be affecting our entire economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant. And, by the way, I hear youre moving to Europe.  Where you going to be?", "filename": "19December2014EndofYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Looking ahead to your work with Congress next year, youve mentioned as an area of possible compromise tax reform.  And so I am wondering, do you see a Republican Congress as presenting a better opportunity for actually getting tax reform next year?  Will you be putting out a new proposal?  Are you willing to consider both individual and corporate side of the tax ledger there?  And also, are you still concerned about corporate inversions? President Obama:  I think an all-Democratic Congress would have provided an even better opportunity for tax reform.  But I think, talking to Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell that they are serious about wanting to get some things done.  The tax area is one area where we can get things done.  And I think in the coming weeks leading up to the State of Union, there will be some conversations at the staff levels about what principles each side are looking at. I can tell you broadly what Id like to see.  Id like to see more simplicity in the system.  Id like to see more fairness in the system.  With respect to the corporate tax reform issue, we know that there are companies that are paying the full freight -- 35 percent -- higher than just about any other company on Earth, if you're paying 35 percent, and then there are other companies that are paying zero because theyve got better accountants or lawyers.  That's not fair.  There are companies that are parking money outside the country because of tax avoidance.  We think that its important that everybody pays something if, in fact, they are effectively headquartered in the United States.  In terms of corporate inversion, those are situations where companies really are headquartered here but, on paper, switch their headquarters to see if they can avoid paying their fair share of taxes.  I think that needs to be fixed.  So, fairness, everybody paying their fair share, everybody taking responsibility I think is going to be very important.  Some of those principles Ive heard Republicans say they share.  How we do that -- the devil is in the details.  And Ill be interested in seeing what they want to move forward.  Im going to make sure that we put forward some pretty specific proposals building on what weve already put forward. One other element of this that I think is important is -- and Ive been on this hobby horse now for six years.  [Audience member sneezes.]  Bless you.  Weve got a lot of infrastructure weve got to rebuild in this country if we're going to be competitive -- roads, bridges, ports, airports, electrical grids, water systems, sewage systems.  We are way behind.  And early on we indicated that there is a way of us potentially doing corporate tax reform, lowering rates, eliminating loopholes so everybody is paying their fair share, and during that transition also providing a mechanism where we can get some infrastructure built.  Id like to see us work on that issue as well.  Historically, obviously, infrastructure has not been a Democratic or a Republican issue, and Id like to see if we can return to that tradition. Julie Pace. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask about Cuba. What would you say to dissidents or democracy advocates inside Cuba who fear that the policy changes you announced this week could give the Castro regime economic benefits without having to address human rights or their political system?  When your Administration was lifting sanctions on Myanmar you sought commitments of reform.  Why not do the same with Cuba? And if I could just follow up on North Korea.  Do you have any indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country, perhaps China?", "filename": "19December2014EndofYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "And over time, that chips away at this hermetically sealed society, and I believe offers the best prospect then of leading to greater freedom, greater self-determination on the part of the Cuban people.  I think it will happen in fits and starts.  But through engagement, we have a better chance of bringing about change then we would have otherwise. Question:  Do you have a goal for where you see Cuba being at the end of your presidency? President Obama:  I think it would be unrealistic for me to map out exactly where Cuba will be.  But change is going to come to Cuba.  It has to.  Theyve got an economy that doesnt work.  Theyve been reliant for years first on subsidies from the Soviet Union, then on subsidies from Venezuela.  Those cant be sustained.  And the more the Cuban people see whats possible, the more interested they are going to be in change.  But how societies change is country-specific, its culturally specific.  It could happen fast; it could happen slower than Id like; but its going to happen.  And I think this change in policy is going to advance that. Lesley Clark. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I had a number of questions on Cuba as well.  Appreciate that.  I wanted to -- President Obama:  Do I have to write all these down?  How many are there?", "filename": "19December2014EndofYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Question:  Provocative activities any time the U.S. has sort of reached out a hand to them.  I wanted to see what is your knowledge of whether Fidel Castro -- did he have any role in the talks?  When you talked to President Raul Castro, did Fidel Castros name come up?  Or did you ask about him?  How hes doing?  People haven't seen him in a while.  Given the deep opposition from some Republicans in Congress to lifting the embargo, to an embassy, to any of the changes that youre doing, are you going to personally get involved in terms of talking to them about efforts that they want to do to block money on a new embassy? President Obama:  All right, Lesley, I think Im going to cut you off here.  This is taking up a lot of time. Question:  Okay, all right. President Obama:  All right.  So, with respect to sabotage, I mean, my understanding of the history, for example, of the plane being shot down, its not clear that that was the Cuban government purposely trying to undermine overtures by the Clinton Administration.  It was a tragic circumstance that ended up collapsing talks that had begun to take place.  I haven't seen a historical record that suggests that they shot the plane down specifically in order to undermine overtures by the Clinton government. I think it is not precedented for the President of the United States and the President of Cuba to make an announcement at the same time that they are moving towards normalizing relations.  So there hasnt been anything like this in the past. That doesnt meant that over the next two years we can anticipate them taking certain actions that we may end up finding deeply troubling either inside of Cuba or with respect to their foreign policy.  And that could put significant strains on the relationship.  But thats true of a lot of countries out there where we have an embassy.  And the whole point of normalizing relations is that it gives us a greater opportunity to have influence with that government than not.  So I would be surprised if the Cuban government purposely tries to undermine what is now effectively its own policy.  I wouldnt be surprised if they take at any given time actions that we think are a problem.  And we will be in a position to respond to whatever actions they take the same way we do with a whole range of countries around the world when they do things we think are wrong.  But the point is, is that we will be in a better position I think to actually have some influence, and there may be carrots as well as sticks that we can then apply. The only way that Fidels name came up -- I think I may have mentioned this in the Davie Muir article -- interview that I did -- was I delivered a fairly lengthy statement at the front end about how were looking forward to a new future in the relationship between our two countries, but that we are going to continue to press on issues of democracy and human rights, which we think are important.  My opening remarks probably took about 15 minutes, which on the phone is a pretty long time.  And at the end of that, he said, Mr. President, youre still a young man.  Perhaps you have the -- at the end of my remarks I apologized for taking such a long time, but I wanted to make sure that before we engaged in the conversation he was very clear about where I stood.  He said, oh, dont worry about it, Mr. President, youre still a young man and you have still the chance to break Fidels record -- he once spoke seven hours straight. And then, President Castro proceeded to deliver his own preliminary remarks that last at least twice as long as mine.  And then I was able to say, obviously it runs in the family.  But that was the only discussion of Fidel Castro that we had.  I sort of forgot all the other questions. Question:  I have a few more if youre -- how personally involved are you going to get in -- President Obama:  With respect to Congress?  We cannot unilaterally bring down the embargo.  Thats codified in the Libertad Act.  And what I do think is going to happen, though, is theres going to be a process where Congress digests it.  There are bipartisan supporters of our new approach, there are bipartisan detractors of this new approach.  People will see how the actions we take unfold.  And I think theres going to be a healthy debate inside of Congress.  And I will certainly weigh in.  I think that ultimately we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo, which I think has been self-defeating in advancing the aims that were interested in.  But I dont anticipate that that happens right away.  I think people are going to want to see how does this move forward before theres any serious debate about whether or not we would make major shifts in the embargo. Roberta Rampton. Question:  I want to follow on that by asking, under what conditions would you meet with President Castro in Havana?  Would you have certain preconditions that you would want to see met before doing that?  And on the hack, I know that you said that youre not going to announce your response, but can you say whether youre considering additional economic or financial sanctions on North Korea?  Can you rule out the use of military force or some kind of cyber hit of your own? President Obama:  I think Im going to leave it where I left it, which is we just confirmed that it was North Korea; we have been working up a range of options.  They will be presented to me.  I will make a decision on those based on what I believe is proportional and appropriate to the nature of this crime. With respect to Cuba, were not at a stage here where me visiting Cuba or President Castro coming to the United States is in the cards.  I dont know how this relationship will develop over the next several years.  Im a fairly young man so I imagine that at some point in my life I will have the opportunity to visit Cuba and enjoy interacting with the Cuban people.  But theres nothing specific where we're trying to target some sort of visit on my part. Colleen McCain Nelson. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama:  There you are. Question:  You spoke earlier about 2014 being a breakthrough year, and you ended the year with executive actions on Cuba and immigration and climate change.  But you didn't make much progress this year on your legislative agenda.  And some Republican lawmakers have said they're less inclined to work with you if you pursue executive actions so aggressively.  Are you going to continue to pursue executive actions if that creates more roadblocks for your legislative agenda?  Or have you concluded that its not possible to break the fever in Washington and the partisan gridlock here?", "filename": "19December2014EndofYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "So, in terms of process, youve got a Nebraska judge thats still determining whether or not the new path for this pipeline is appropriate.  Once that is resolved, then the State Department will have all the information it needs to make its decision.  But Ive just tried to give this perspective, because I think that theres been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the U.S. economy, and its hard to see on paper where exactly theyre getting that information from. In terms of oil prices and how it impacts the decision, I think that it wont have a significant impact except perhaps in the minds of folks -- when gas prices are lower, maybe theyre less susceptible to the argument that this is the answer to lowering gas prices.  But it was never going to be the answer to lowering gas prices, because the oil that would be piped through the Keystone pipeline would go into the world market.  And thats what determines oil prices, ultimately. Question:  And in terms of Congress forcing your hand on this, is this something where you clearly say youre not going to let Congress force your hand on whether to approve or disapprove of this? President Obama:  Ill see what they do.  Well take that up in the New Year. Question:  Any New Years resolutions? President Obama:  Ill ask -- April, go ahead.  Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Last question, I guess.  Six years ago this month, I asked you what was the state of black America in the Oval Office, and you said it was the the best of times and the worst of times.  You said it was the best of times in the sense that there was -- has never been more opportunity for African Americans to receive a good education, and the worst of times for unemployment and the lack of opportunity.  We're ending 2014.  What is the state of black America as we talk about those issues as well as racial issues in this country?", "filename": "19December2014EndofYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions, but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week -- the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling.  I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday.  But watching the debate over the course of the last week, I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit. First of all, I want to make sure that, once again, I send my thoughts and prayers, as well as Michelles, to the family of Trayvon Martin, and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which theyve dealt with the entire situation.  I can only imagine what theyre going through, and its remarkable how theyve handled it. The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is theres going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case -- I'll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues.  The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner.  The prosecution and the defense made their arguments.  The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict.  And once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works.  But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling.  You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son.  Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.  And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, theres a lot of pain around what happened here, I think its important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesnt go away. There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store.  That includes me.  There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.  That happens to me -- at least before I was a senator.  There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.  That happens often. And I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.  And its inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.  The African American community is also knowledgeable that there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws -- everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws.  And that ends up having an impact in terms of how people interpret the case. Now, this isn't to say that the African American community is nave about the fact that African American young men are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system; that theyre disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.  Its not to make excuses for that fact -- although black folks do interpret the reasons for that in a historical context.  They understand that some of the violence that takes place in poor black neighborhoods around the country is born out of a very violent past in this country, and that the poverty and dysfunction that we see in those communities can be traced to a very difficult history. And so the fact that sometimes thats unacknowledged adds to the frustration.  And the fact that a lot of African American boys are painted with a broad brush and the excuse is given, well, there are these statistics out there that show that African American boys are more violent -- using that as an excuse to then see sons treated differently causes pain. I think the African American community is also not nave in understanding that, statistically, somebody like Trayvon Martin was statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else.  So folks understand the challenges that exist for African American boys.  But they get frustrated, I think, if they feel that theres no context for it and that context is being denied. And that all contributes I think to a sense that if a white male teen was involved in the same kind of scenario, that, from top to bottom, both the outcome and the aftermath might have been different. Now, the question for me at least, and I think for a lot of folks, is where do we take this?  How do we learn some lessons from this and move in a positive direction?  I think its understandable that there have been demonstrations and vigils and protests, and some of that stuff is just going to have to work its way through, as long as it remains nonviolent.  If I see any violence, then I will remind folks that that dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family.  But beyond protests or vigils, the question is, are there some concrete things that we might be able to do. I know that Eric Holder is reviewing what happened down there, but I think its important for people to have some clear expectations here.  Traditionally, these are issues of state and local government, the criminal code.  And law enforcement is traditionally done at the state and local levels, not at the federal levels. That doesnt mean, though, that as a nation we cant do some things that I think would be productive.  So let me just give a couple of specifics that Im still bouncing around with my staff, so were not rolling out some five-point plan, but some areas where I think all of us could potentially focus. Number one, precisely because law enforcement is often determined at the state and local level, I think it would be productive for the Justice Department, governors, mayors to work with law enforcement about training at the state and local levels in order to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists. When I was in Illinois, I passed racial profiling legislation, and it actually did just two simple things.  One, it collected data on traffic stops and the race of the person who was stopped.  But the other thing was it resourced us training police departments across the state on how to think about potential racial bias and ways to further professionalize what they were doing. And initially, the police departments across the state were resistant, but actually they came to recognize that if it was done in a fair, straightforward way that it would allow them to do their jobs better and communities would have more confidence in them and, in turn, be more helpful in applying the law.  And obviously, law enforcement has got a very tough job. So thats one area where I think there are a lot of resources and best practices that could be brought to bear if state and local governments are receptive.  And I think a lot of them would be.  And let's figure out are there ways for us to push out that kind of training. Along the same lines, I think it would be useful for us to examine some state and local laws to see if it -- if they are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case, rather than diffuse potential altercations. I know that there's been commentary about the fact that the \"stand your ground\" laws in Florida were not used as a defense in the case.  On the other hand, if we're sending a message as a society in our communities that someone who is armed potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there's a way for them to exit from a situation, is that really going to be contributing to the kind of peace and security and order that we'd like to see? And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something like these \"stand your ground\" laws, I'd just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk?  And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened?  And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws. Number three -- and this is a long-term project -- we need to spend some time in thinking about how do we bolster and reinforce our African American boys.  And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about.  There are a lot of kids out there who need help who are getting a lot of negative reinforcement.  And is there more that we can do to give them the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them? I'm not nave about the prospects of some grand, new federal program.  I'm not sure that thats what we're talking about here. But I do recognize that as President, I've got some convening power, and there are a lot of good programs that are being done across the country on this front.  And for us to be able to gather together business leaders and local elected officials and clergy and celebrities and athletes, and figure out how are we doing a better job helping young African American men feel that they're a full part of this society and that they've got pathways and avenues to succeed -- I think that would be a pretty good outcome from what was obviously a tragic situation.  And we're going to spend some time working on that and thinking about that. And then, finally, I think it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching.  There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race.  I haven't seen that be particularly productive when politicians try to organize conversations.  They end up being stilted and politicized, and folks are locked into the positions they already have.  On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?  Am I judging people as much as I can, based on not the color of their skin, but the content of their character?", "filename": "19July2013SpeechonTrayvonMartin.txt"}, {"question": "And were now surrounded by the symbols of a Germany reborn.  A rebuilt Reichstag and its glistening glass dome.  An American embassy back at its historic home on Pariser Platz.  And this square itself, once a desolate no mans land, is now open to all.  So while I am not the first American President to come to this gate, I am proud to stand on its Eastern side to pay tribute to the past. For throughout all this history, the fate of this city came down to a simple question:  Will we live free or in chains?  Under governments that uphold our universal rights, or regimes that suppress them?  In open societies that respect the sanctity of the individual and our free will, or in closed societies that suffocate the soul?", "filename": "19June2013BrandenburgGateSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "That is how we'll stay true to our better history while reaching for the day of peace and justice that is to come.  These are the beliefs that guide us, the values that inspire us, the principles that bind us together as free peoples who still believe the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- that \"injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\" And we should ask, should anyone ask if our generation has the courage to meet these tests?", "filename": "19June2013BrandenburgGateSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Obviously, the entire country has been shocked and heartbroken by what happened in Charleston.  The nature of this attack -- in a place of worship, where congregants invite in a stranger to worship with them, only to be gunned down -- adds to the pain.  The apparent motivations of the shooter remind us that racism remains a blight that we have to combat together.  We have made great progress, but we have to be vigilant because it still lingers.  And when it's poisoning the minds of young people, it betrays our ideals and tears our democracy apart. But as much as we grieve this particular tragedy, I think it's important, as I mentioned at the White House, to step back and recognize these tragedies have become far too commonplace. Few people understand the terrible toll of gun violence like mayors do.  Whether its a mass shooting like the one in Charleston, or individual attacks of violence that add up over time, it tears at the fabric of a community.  It costs you money and it costs resources.  It costs this country dearly. More than 11,000 Americans were killed by gun violence in 2013 alone -- 11,000.  If Congress had passed some common-sense gun safety reforms after Newtown, after a group of children had been gunned down in their own classroom -- reforms that 90 percent of the American people supported -- we wouldnt have prevented every act of violence, or even most.  We dont know if it would have prevented what happened in Charleston.  No reform can guarantee the elimination of violence.  But we might still have some more Americans with us.  We might have stopped one shooter.  Some families might still be whole.  You all might have to attend fewer funerals. And we should be strong enough to acknowledge this.  At the very least, we should be able to talk about this issue as citizens, without demonizing all gun owners who are overwhelmingly law-abiding, but also without suggesting that any debate about this involves a wild-eyed plot to take everybodys guns away.  I know todays politics makes it less likely that we see any sort of serious gun safety legislation.  I remarked that it was very unlikely that this Congress would act.  And some reporters, I think, took this as resignation.  I want to be clear -- I am not resigned.  I have faith we will eventually do the right thing.  I was simply making the point that we have to move public opinion.  We have to feel a sense of urgency.  Ultimately, Congress will follow the people.  And we have to stop being confused about this.  At some point, as a country, we have to reckon with what happens.  It is not good enough simply to show sympathy. You dont see murder on this kind of scale, with this kind of frequency, in any other advanced nation on Earth.  Every country has violent, hateful, or mentally unstable people.  Whats different is not every country is awash with easily accessible guns.  And so I refuse to act as if this is the new normal, or to pretend that its simply sufficient to grieve, and that any mention of us doing something to stop is somehow politicizing the problem.  We need a change in attitudes among everybody -- lawful gun owners, those who are unfamiliar with guns.  We have to have a conversation about it and fix this.  And ultimately, Congress acts when the public insists on action.  And weve seen how public opinion can change.  Weve seen it change on gay marriage.  Weve seen it beginning to change on climate change.  Weve got to shift how we think about this issue.  And we have the capacity to change, but we have to feel a sense of urgency about it.  We, as a people, have got to change.  Thats how we honor those families.  Thats how we honor the families in Newtown.  Thats how we honor the families in Aurora. Now, the first time I spoke at this conference, in 2008, I said that American cities shouldnt be succeeding despite Washington, they should be succeeding with some help from Washington.  And as President, Ive made it a priority to partner with mayors like you.  That's why Ive named three former mayors to my Cabinet.  That's why I asked a former president of this conference, Jerry Abramson, to be one of my top advisors.  That's why my staff and I work with mayors across the country just about every day, on just about every issue under the sun - from school reform to community policing, from business development to veterans homelessness. Because mayors have to get the job done.  If you're a mayor, its not sufficient to just blather on.  You actually have to do something.  Its not enough to figure out how do I position myself on a particular issue to minimize the possibility that I might get in trouble or criticized -- because people expect to trim the trees and pave the roads, and pick up the garbage, and educate our kids, and police our streets. Whatever the problem, large or small, you got to do everything you can to solve it.  You dont let partisanship stop you.  You dont let cynicism stop you.  Youre always in the hunt for good ideas, no matter where they come from.  And Im going to embarrass Jerry for a second.  He took his wife, Madeline, to Paris a few years after they got married.  And she took in all the splendor of the Champs-lyses.  And he took photos of garbage cans.  That's a mayor for you.  So she teased him about it.  She said, theres the Eiffel Tower.  Theres the Seine.  And he said, Those are some beautiful garbage cans.  And soon enough, downtown Louisville had garbage cans that looked a lot like the Parisian garbage cans.  Thats a mayor, right there.  Somebody whos always thinking about how to make his or her city better -- even on vacation in Paris -- and stops at nothing to get it done. Now, as President, Im constantly thinking about how we, together, can keep growing the economy and growing new pathways of opportunity for the American people to get ahead.  And across the country, the good news is were making progress.  And you're seeing it in your cities.  More than 12 million new private sector jobs in the past five years; more than 16 million Americans whove gained health insurance; more jobs creating more clean energy.  Here in California, solar is going crazy.  We're producing 10 times as much solar power today as we did when I came into office -- 10 times; three times as much wind power; double the amount of clean energy.  More kids graduating from high school and college than ever before.  Im proud of that record.  And by the way weve done it while reducing the deficit by two-thirds.  You don't hear that that much, but let me just point that out.  And Im proud of it particularly when its so hard to get anything through Congress - even when were talking about issues that most Americans outside of Washington agree on.  But thats also why weve partnered with many of you over the past couple of years -- to make real progress on the economic priorities that matter to middle-class Americans.  Were working with many of you to help working families make ends meet and feel more secure in a changing economy.  So far, 19 cities have enacted paid sick days; five states have enacted paid sick days or paid family leave.  Oregon is set to join them soon.  Seventeen states have raised their minimum wage; 27 cities and counties have taken action to raise the wage, as well.  Were working with many of you to help working families earn higher wages down the road with skills and education they need.  Seattle, a city with a Democratic mayor, Ed Murray, just passed universal pre-K.  Indianapolis, a city with a Republican mayor, Greg Ballard, is starting citywide preschool scholarships.  Thirty-four states have increased funding for preschool as well, which means even more young people getting the early enrichment that can pay off over a lifetime.  Three months ago, I launched an initiative called TechHire to help train workers for the high-skill, high-wage jobs of tomorrow.  Twenty-one communities have signed up for TechHire so far, and were looking to double that number.  So if your town has tech jobs that need filling to people who want to fill them, come join us. Were working with many of you to generate more high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.  Eleven cities have joined a new initiative called Startup in a Day to help entrepreneurs apply for all the licenses and permits they need to start a business in just one day.  Cut the red tape.  Were working with cities to create a network of high-tech manufacturing hubs to keep America at the forefront of innovation.  The first hub in Youngstown, Ohio is doing cutting-edge research in 3-D printing and has already attracted tens of millions of dollars in investment to the region.  So were creating jobs, were training folks for jobs.  Were also working with many of you to make our streets safer and our communities stronger.  More than 230 local and tribal leaders have joined the My Brothers Keeper initiative, and are taking meaningful steps to change the odds for young people in tough circumstances.  Together, youre working to curb juvenile arrests, reduce absenteeism -- and youre helping these kids imagine a bigger future for themselves.  Today, at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab just down the road, more than 100 students from Oakland and San Francisco are participating in the first MBK Day at the Lab, where they can learn about STEM careers.  And meanwhile, from police holding impromptu town hall meetings in barbershops in Charlotte, to the Boston Police Academy improving how it trains cops to deal with young people on the job, cities like yours are striving to rebuild trust between law enforcement and communities, making sure police have the resources they need to do their job, and making sure that every police officer who has an incredibly tough job is trained in making the kinds of connections with communities that engender trust and ensure that everybody is treated equally under the law -- which makes for smart law enforcement and vindicates our values.  So these are just a few of the examples of the work thats being done.  And Id name every single way that were working together to open new doors of opportunity for the American people, but wed be here all day.  So heres the bottom line.  On Americas most important economic priorities -- from supporting working families to improving education, to creating good new jobs, to getting people to those new jobs, to improving affordable housing, to dealing with homelessness -- cities are not standing still.  You are moving forward.  So I want to say two things to you.  Number one -- thank you.  Thank you for your leadership and your vision.  And I particularly want to thank you because more than just about any other office in the land, those who occupy the office of mayor, are approaching it in a practical way.  Democrats arent clinging to dogmas, and are partnering with businesses anywhere they can.  And Republicans arent clinging to their dogmas; theyre recognizing that government has a role to play in helping make for a vibrant city and expanding opportunity.  And that common-sense, problem-solving, can-do attitude -- thats what the American people are looking for.  Thats what they need.  So I want to say thank you to all of you.  Youre setting a good example. Now, second, I also want to say dont stop now, because weve still got a lot more work to do.  Weve got to keep pushing to grow our economy so that more Americans who work hard feel like their hard work is paying off -- which is why Im working with Congress to pass new 21st century trade agreements with higher standards and tougher protections than past agreements.  And I appreciate the help of many of the mayors here to get that done, because you know its important to your cities. I believe its the right thing to do for American workers and families, or I would not be doing it.  I want to thank all of you who helped me make that case, that this matters to your cities. Weve got to keep pushing to put people to work rebuilding our infrastructure.  Theres not a mayor here who cant reel off 10 infrastructure projects right now that youd love to get funding for, and that would put people to work right away and improve your competitiveness, and help businesses move their products and help people get to their jobs.  We can keep paying the costs of patching over our existing infrastructure -- more expensive, less efficient, leading to higher commute times, more waste.  Thats an option.  Or we can create tens of thousands of jobs right now building a 21st century infrastructure that makes us competitive well into the 21st century.  Thats what we need to do.  We just got to convince Congress to make it happen.  And I need mayors to help, from all across the country.  Put some pressure on Congress to get this done.  Weve got to keep pushing to prepare for the impacts of climate change -- because its science.  Its a fact.  Its like gravity.  Audience Member:  Yes, it is. President Obama:  It is.  A lot of cities have gone far ahead of states on this issue -- along with states.  Youre making a difference right now.  Youre not waiting for Congress.  Mayor Roy Buol is here from Dubuque, Iowa.  Theyve set a target to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 50 percent from 2003 levels by the end of the next decade.  Just met with Governor Jerry Brown.  Hes talking about how California, which so often has been a leader on environmental issues, is looking to partner and make a difference internationally. Today, my administration proposed new fuel standards for buses and tractor-trailers and other heavy-duty vehicles -- another important step towards reducing harmful carbon pollution and protecting our planet. But a lot of this does come down to Congress.  I know many of you are worried about Congress cutting programs that are important to your citys economic growth.  But the battle we should be having with Congress isnt just about individual programs.  Its about the foolish, self-destructive cuts that in Washington are known as the sequester -- because with the sequester, the whole pie is smaller, so protecting one program means cutting another one.  Thats why youre facing cuts that dont make any sense to things like TIGER grants, which you all know are so important to putting our people to work rebuilding our infrastructure.  Thats the reason why its so hard for us to get the funding we need to get homeless assistance grants, which help some of our most vulnerable neighbors and get them off the streets.  Thats why its been so difficult to fund the preschool development grants, which help educate our children -- which we know if we make that investment will pay off for your cities, your states, and for our country. Ive been clear, I will not sign bills at sequestration levels.  I will not sign bills that seek to increase defense spending before addressing any of our needs here at home.  And I need your help.  I need your help, Mayors, to talk to your members of Congress to get rid of the sequester once and for all -- because it is harming our cities and harming our country. There is no business -- no successful business -- that if it needed to reduce spending, would simply lop off 10 percent of everything.  Or 15 percent of everything.  Thats not how any of us would run our household budget.  Youd cut out things you dont need, but youd still keep the college fund going.  Youd still pay your health insurance bill and your mortgage note.  There are things we have to do as a country to stay ahead. Once again, mayors understand that if theres a conflict between ideology and reality, you should opt for reality.  Reality is a stubborn thing -- facts, evidence, reason.  So, thanks for your partnership.  I want you to know that as long as Im in the White House, Ive got your back.  I love the country, I love the suburbs, but Im a city guy.  And I know that when cities thrive, suburbs thrive.  And when cities thrive, farmlands thrive.  And when cities thrive, states thrive.  And when cities thrive, America thrives.  You guys are making it happen.  I enjoy working with each and every one of you.  And I know that each of you takes pride in what makes your hometown unique.  You may be proud of your pizza, or your hoagies, or your barbeque -- even though everybody knows Chicago has the best pizza.  You may be proud of your citys victory parades, even though we got a Blackhawk parade thats pretty good.  Im sure youre all very proud of your parks.  Weve got nice parks.  Or the number of sunny days youve got -- which we enjoy half the year.  Chances are youve got a few superlatives ready in case somebody asks, What makes your city so special?", "filename": "19June2015U.S.ConferenceofMayorsAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Please, have a seat. Thank you very much. I want to begin by thanking Hillary Clinton, who has traveled so much these last six months that she is approaching a new landmark -- one million frequent flyer miles. I count on Hillary every single day, and I believe that she will go down as one of the finest Secretaries of State in our nations history. The State Department is a fitting venue to mark a new chapter in American diplomacy. For six months, we have witnessed an extraordinary change taking place in the Middle East and North Africa. Square by square, town by town, country by country, the people have risen up to demand their basic human rights. Two leaders have stepped aside. More may follow. And though these countries may be a great distance from our shores, we know that our own future is bound to this region by the forces of economics and security, by history and by faith. Today, I want to talk about this change -- the forces that are driving it and how we can respond in a way that advances our values and strengthens our security. Now, already, weve done much to shift our foreign policy following a decade defined by two costly conflicts. After years of war in Iraq, weve removed 100,000 American troops and ended our combat mission there. In Afghanistan, weve broken the Talibans momentum, and this July we will begin to bring our troops home and continue a transition to Afghan lead. And after years of war against al Qaeda and its affiliates, we have dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader, Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden was no martyr. He was a mass murderer who offered a message of hate -- an insistence that Muslims had to take up arms against the West, and that violence against men, women and children was the only path to change. He rejected democracy and individual rights for Muslims in favor of violent extremism; his agenda focused on what he could destroy -- not what he could build. Bin Laden and his murderous vision won some adherents. But even before his death, al Qaeda was losing its struggle for relevance, as the overwhelming majority of people saw that the slaughter of innocents did not answer their cries for a better life. By the time we found bin Laden, al Qaedas agenda had come to be seen by the vast majority of the region as a dead end, and the people of the Middle East and North Africa had taken their future into their own hands. That story of self-determination began six months ago in Tunisia. On December 17th, a young vendor named Mohammed Bouazizi was devastated when a police officer confiscated his cart. This was not unique.  Its the same kind of humiliation that takes place every day in many parts of the world -- the relentless tyranny of governments that deny their citizens dignity. Only this time, something different happened. After local officials refused to hear his complaints, this young man, who had never been particularly active in politics, went to the headquarters of the provincial government, doused himself in fuel, and lit himself on fire. There are times in the course of history when the actions of ordinary citizens spark movements for change because they speak to a longing for freedom that has been building up for years. In America, think of the defiance of those patriots in Boston who refused to pay taxes to a King, or the dignity of Rosa Parks as she sat courageously in her seat. So it was in Tunisia, as that vendors act of desperation tapped into the frustration felt throughout the country. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets, then thousands. And in the face of batons and sometimes bullets, they refused to go home -- day after day, week after week -- until a dictator of more than two decades finally left power. The story of this revolution, and the ones that followed, should not have come as a surprise. The nations of the Middle East and North Africa won their independence long ago, but in too many places their people did not. In too many countries, power has been concentrated in the hands of a few. In too many countries, a citizen like that young vendor had nowhere to turn -- no honest judiciary to hear his case; no independent media to give him voice; no credible political party to represent his views; no free and fair election where he could choose his leader. And this lack of self-determination -- the chance to make your life what you will -- has applied to the regions economy as well. Yes, some nations are blessed with wealth in oil and gas, and that has led to pockets of prosperity. But in a global economy based on knowledge, based on innovation, no development strategy can be based solely upon what comes out of the ground. Nor can people reach their potential when you cannot start a business without paying a bribe. In the face of these challenges, too many leaders in the region tried to direct their peoples grievances elsewhere. The West was blamed as the source of all ills, a half-century after the end of colonialism. Antagonism toward Israel became the only acceptable outlet for political expression. Divisions of tribe, ethnicity and religious sect were manipulated as a means of holding on to power, or taking it away from somebody else. But the events of the past six months show us that strategies of repression and strategies of diversion will not work anymore. Satellite television and the Internet provide a window into the wider world -- a world of astonishing progress in places like India and Indonesia and Brazil. Cell phones and social networks allow young people to connect and organize like never before. And so a new generation has emerged. And their voices tell us that change cannot be denied. In Cairo, we heard the voice of the young mother who said, Its like I can finally breathe fresh air for the first time. In Sanaa, we heard the students who chanted, The night must come to an end. In Benghazi, we heard the engineer who said, Our words are free now.  Its a feeling you cant explain. In Damascus, we heard the young man who said, After the first yelling, the first shout, you feel dignity.  Those shouts of human dignity are being heard across the region. And through the moral force of nonviolence, the people of the region have achieved more change in six months than terrorists have accomplished in decades. Of course, change of this magnitude does not come easily. In our day and age -- a time of 24-hour news cycles and constant communication -- people expect the transformation of the region to be resolved in a matter of weeks. But it will be years before this story reaches its end. Along the way, there will be good days and there will bad days. In some places, change will be swift; in others, gradual. And as weve already seen, calls for change may give way, in some cases, to fierce contests for power. The question before us is what role America will play as this story unfolds. For decades, the United States has pursued a set of core interests in the region: countering terrorism and stopping the spread of nuclear weapons; securing the free flow of commerce and safe-guarding the security of the region; standing up for Israels security and pursuing Arab-Israeli peace. We will continue to do these things, with the firm belief that Americas interests are not hostile to peoples hopes; theyre essential to them. We believe that no one benefits from a nuclear arms race in the region, or al Qaedas brutal attacks. We believe people everywhere would see their economies crippled by a cut-off in energy supplies. As we did in the Gulf War, we will not tolerate aggression across borders, and we will keep our commitments to friends and partners. Yet we must acknowledge that a strategy based solely upon the narrow pursuit of these interests will not fill an empty stomach or allow someone to speak their mind. Moreover, failure to speak to the broader aspirations of ordinary people will only feed the suspicion that has festered for years that the United States pursues our interests at their expense. Given that this mistrust runs both ways -- as Americans have been seared by hostage-taking and violent rhetoric and terrorist attacks that have killed thousands of our citizens -- a failure to change our approach threatens a deepening spiral of division between the United States and the Arab world. And thats why, two years ago in Cairo, I began to broaden our engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect. I believed then -- and I believe now -- that we have a stake not just in the stability of nations, but in the self-determination of individuals. The status quo is not sustainable. Societies held together by fear and repression may offer the illusion of stability for a time, but they are built upon fault lines that will eventually tear asunder. So we face a historic opportunity. We have the chance to show that America values the dignity of the street vendor in Tunisia more than the raw power of the dictator.  There must be no doubt that the United States of America welcomes change that advances self-determination and opportunity. Yes, there will be perils that accompany this moment of promise. But after decades of accepting the world as it is in the region, we have a chance to pursue the world as it should be. Of course, as we do, we must proceed with a sense of humility. Its not America that put people into the streets of Tunis or Cairo -- it was the people themselves who launched these movements, and its the people themselves that must ultimately determine their outcome. Not every country will follow our particular form of representative democracy, and there will be times when our short-term interests dont align perfectly with our long-term vision for the region. But we can, and we will, speak out for a set of core principles -- principles that have guided our response to the events over the past six months: The United States opposes the use of violence and repression against the people of the region.  The United States supports a set of universal rights. And these rights include free speech, the freedom of peaceful assembly, the freedom of religion, equality for men and women under the rule of law, and the right to choose your own leaders -- whether you live in Baghdad or Damascus, Sanaa or Tehran. And we support political and economic reform in the Middle East and North Africa that can meet the legitimate aspirations of ordinary people throughout the region. Our support for these principles is not a secondary interest. Today I want to make it clear that it is a top priority that must be translated into concrete actions, and supported by all of the diplomatic, economic and strategic tools at our disposal. Let me be specific. First, it will be the policy of the United States to promote reform across the region, and to support transitions to democracy. That effort begins in Egypt and Tunisia, where the stakes are high -- as Tunisia was at the vanguard of this democratic wave, and Egypt is both a longstanding partner and the Arab worlds largest nation. Both nations can set a strong example through free and fair elections, a vibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic institutions, and responsible regional leadership. But our support must also extend to nations where transitions have yet to take place. Unfortunately, in too many countries, calls for change have thus far been answered by violence. The most extreme example is Libya, where Muammar Qaddafi launched a war against his own people, promising to hunt them down like rats. As I said when the United States joined an international coalition to intervene, we cannot prevent every injustice perpetrated by a regime against its people, and we have learned from our experience in Iraq just how costly and difficult it is to try to impose regime change by force -- no matter how well-intentioned it may be. But in Libya, we saw the prospect of imminent massacre, we had a mandate for action, and heard the Libyan peoples call for help. Had we not acted along with our NATO allies and regional coalition partners, thousands would have been killed. The message would have been clear: Keep power by killing as many people as it takes.  Now, time is working against Qaddafi. He does not have control over his country. The opposition has organized a legitimate and credible Interim Council. And when Qaddafi inevitably leaves or is forced from power, decades of provocation will come to an end, and the transition to a democratic Libya can proceed. While Libya has faced violence on the greatest scale, its not the only place where leaders have turned to repression to remain in power. Most recently, the Syrian regime has chosen the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens. The United States has condemned these actions, and working with the international community we have stepped up our sanctions on the Syrian regime -- including sanctions announced yesterday on President Assad and those around him. The Syrian people have shown their courage in demanding a transition to democracy. President Assad now has a choice: He can lead that transition, or get out of the way. The Syrian government must stop shooting demonstrators and allow peaceful protests. It must release political prisoners and stop unjust arrests. It must allow human rights monitors to have access to cities like Daraa; and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition. Otherwise, President Assad and his regime will continue to be challenged from within and will continue to be isolated abroad. So far, Syria has followed its Iranian ally, seeking assistance from Tehran in the tactics of suppression. And this speaks to the hypocrisy of the Iranian regime, which says it stand for the rights of protesters abroad, yet represses its own people at home. Lets remember that the first peaceful protests in the region were in the streets of Tehran, where the government brutalized women and men, and threw innocent people into jail. We still hear the chants echo from the rooftops of Tehran. The image of a young woman dying in the streets is still seared in our memory. And we will continue to insist that the Iranian people deserve their universal rights, and a government that does not smother their aspirations. Now, our opposition to Irans intolerance and Irans repressive measures, as well as its illicit nuclear program and its support of terror, is well known. But if America is to be credible, we must acknowledge that at times our friends in the region have not all reacted to the demands for consistent change -- with change thats consistent with the principles that Ive outlined today. Thats true in Yemen, where President Saleh needs to follow through on his commitment to transfer power. And thats true today in Bahrain. Bahrain is a longstanding partner, and we are committed to its security. We recognize that Iran has tried to take advantage of the turmoil there, and that the Bahraini government has a legitimate interest in the rule of law. Nevertheless, we have insisted both publicly and privately that mass arrests and brute force are at odds with the universal rights of Bahrains citizens, and we will -- and such steps will not make legitimate calls for reform go away. The only way forward is for the government and opposition to engage in a dialogue, and you cant have a real dialogue when parts of the peaceful opposition are in jail. The government must create the conditions for dialogue, and the opposition must participate to forge a just future for all Bahrainis. Indeed, one of the broader lessons to be drawn from this period is that sectarian divides need not lead to conflict. In Iraq, we see the promise of a multiethnic, multi-sectarian democracy. The Iraqi people have rejected the perils of political violence in favor of a democratic process, even as theyve taken full responsibility for their own security. Of course, like all new democracies, they will face setbacks. But Iraq is poised to play a key role in the region if it continues its peaceful progress. And as they do, we will be proud to stand with them as a steadfast partner. So in the months ahead, America must use all our influence to encourage reform in the region. Even as we acknowledge that each country is different, we need to speak honestly about the principles that we believe in, with friend and foe alike. Our message is simple: If you take the risks that reform entails, you will have the full support of the United States.  We must also build on our efforts to broaden our engagement beyond elites, so that we reach the people who will shape the future -- particularly young people. We will continue to make good on the commitments that I made in Cairo -- to build networks of entrepreneurs and expand exchanges in education, to foster cooperation in science and technology, and combat disease. Across the region, we intend to provide assistance to civil society, including those that may not be officially sanctioned, and who speak uncomfortable truths. And we will use the technology to connect with -- and listen to -- the voices of the people. For the fact is, real reform does not come at the ballot box alone. Through our efforts we must support those basic rights to speak your mind and access information. We will support open access to the Internet, and the right of journalists to be heard -- whether its a big news organization or a lone blogger. In the 21st century, information is power, the truth cannot be hidden, and the legitimacy of governments will ultimately depend on active and informed citizens. Such open discourse is important even if what is said does not square with our worldview. Let me be clear, America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard, even if we disagree with them. And sometimes we profoundly disagree with them. We look forward to working with all who embrace genuine and inclusive democracy.  What we will oppose is an attempt by any group to restrict the rights of others, and to hold power through coercion and not consent. Because democracy depends not only on elections, but also strong and accountable institutions, and the respect for the rights of minorities. Such tolerance is particularly important when it comes to religion. In Tahrir Square, we heard Egyptians from all walks of life chant, Muslims, Christians, we are one. America will work to see that this spirit prevails -- that all faiths are respected, and that bridges are built among them. In a region that was the birthplace of three world religions, intolerance can lead only to suffering and stagnation. And for this season of change to succeed, Coptic Christians must have the right to worship freely in Cairo, just as Shia must never have their mosques destroyed in Bahrain. What is true for religious minorities is also true when it comes to the rights of women. History shows that countries are more prosperous and more peaceful when women are empowered. And thats why we will continue to insist that universal rights apply to women as well as men -- by focusing assistance on child and maternal health; by helping women to teach, or start a business; by standing up for the right of women to have their voices heard, and to run for office. The region will never reach its full potential when more than half of its population is prevented from achieving their full potential. Now, even as we promote political reform, even as we promote human rights in the region, our efforts cant stop there. So the second way that we must support positive change in the region is through our efforts to advance economic development for nations that are transitioning to democracy.  After all, politics alone has not put protesters into the streets. The tipping point for so many people is the more constant concern of putting food on the table and providing for a family. Too many people in the region wake up with few expectations other than making it through the day, perhaps hoping that their luck will change. Throughout the region, many young people have a solid education, but closed economies leave them unable to find a job.  Entrepreneurs are brimming with ideas, but corruption leaves them unable to profit from those ideas. The greatest untapped resource in the Middle East and North Africa is the talent of its people. In the recent protests, we see that talent on display, as people harness technology to move the world. Its no coincidence that one of the leaders of Tahrir Square was an executive for Google. That energy now needs to be channeled, in country after country, so that economic growth can solidify the accomplishments of the street. For just as democratic revolutions can be triggered by a lack of individual opportunity, successful democratic transitions depend upon an expansion of growth and broad-based prosperity. So, drawing from what weve learned around the world, we think its important to focus on trade, not just aid; on investment, not just assistance. The goal must be a model in which protectionism gives way to openness, the reigns of commerce pass from the few to the many, and the economy generates jobs for the young. Americas support for democracy will therefore be based on ensuring financial stability, promoting reform, and integrating competitive markets with each other and the global economy. And were going to start with Tunisia and Egypt. First, weve asked the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to present a plan at next weeks G8 summit for what needs to be done to stabilize and modernize the economies of Tunisia and Egypt. Together, we must help them recover from the disruptions of their democratic upheaval, and support the governments that will be elected later this year. And we are urging other countries to help Egypt and Tunisia meet its near-term financial needs. Second, we do not want a democratic Egypt to be saddled by the debts of its past.  So we will relieve a democratic Egypt of up to 1 billion dollars in debt, and work with our Egyptian partners to invest these resources to foster growth and entrepreneurship. We will help Egypt regain access to markets by guaranteeing $1 billion in borrowing that is needed to finance infrastructure and job creation. And we will help newly democratic governments recover assets that were stolen. Third, were working with Congress to create Enterprise Funds to invest in Tunisia and Egypt. And these will be modeled on funds that supported the transitions in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. OPIC will soon launch a 2 billion dollars facility to support private investment across the region. And we will work with the allies to refocus the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development so that it provides the same support for democratic transitions and economic modernization in the Middle East and North Africa as it has in Europe. Fourth, the United States will launch a comprehensive Trade and Investment Partnership Initiative in the Middle East and North Africa. If you take out oil exports, this entire region of over 400 million people exports roughly the same amount as Switzerland. So we will work with the EU to facilitate more trade within the region, build on existing agreements to promote integration with U.S. and European markets, and open the door for those countries who adopt high standards of reform and trade liberalization to construct a regional trade arrangement. And just as EU membership served as an incentive for reform in Europe, so should the vision of a modern and prosperous economy create a powerful force for reform in the Middle East and North Africa. Prosperity also requires tearing down walls that stand in the way of progress -- the corruption of elites who steal from their people; the red tape that stops an idea from becoming a business; the patronage that distributes wealth based on tribe or sect. We will help governments meet international obligations, and invest efforts at anti-corruption -- by working with parliamentarians who are developing reforms, and activists who use technology to increase transparency and hold government accountable. Politics and human rights; economic reform. Let me conclude by talking about another cornerstone of our approach to the region, and that relates to the pursuit of peace. For decades, the conflict between Israelis and Arabs has cast a shadow over the region. For Israelis, it has meant living with the fear that their children could be blown up on a bus or by rockets fired at their homes, as well as the pain of knowing that other children in the region are taught to hate them. For Palestinians, it has meant suffering the humiliation of occupation, and never living in a nation of their own. Moreover, this conflict has come with a larger cost to the Middle East, as it impedes partnerships that could bring greater security and prosperity and empowerment to ordinary people. For over two years, my administration has worked with the parties and the international community to end this conflict, building on decades of work by previous administrations. Yet expectations have gone unmet. Israeli settlement activity continues. Palestinians have walked away from talks. The world looks at a conflict that has grinded on and on and on, and sees nothing but stalemate. Indeed, there are those who argue that with all the change and uncertainty in the region, it is simply not possible to move forward now. I disagree. At a time when the people of the Middle East and North Africa are casting off the burdens of the past, the drive for a lasting peace that ends the conflict and resolves all claims is more urgent than ever. Thats certainly true for the two parties involved. For the Palestinians, efforts to delegitimize Israel will end in failure. Symbolic actions to isolate Israel at the United Nations in September wont create an independent state. Palestinian leaders will not achieve peace or prosperity if Hamas insists on a path of terror and rejection. And Palestinians will never realize their independence by denying the right of Israel to exist. As for Israel, our friendship is rooted deeply in a shared history and shared values.  Our commitment to Israels security is unshakeable. And we will stand against attempts to single it out for criticism in international forums. But precisely because of our friendship, its important that we tell the truth: The status quo is unsustainable, and Israel too must act boldly to advance a lasting peace. The fact is, a growing number of Palestinians live west of the Jordan River. Technology will make it harder for Israel to defend itself. A region undergoing profound change will lead to populism in which millions of people -- not just one or two leaders -- must believe peace is possible. The international community is tired of an endless process that never produces an outcome. The dream of a Jewish and democratic state cannot be fulfilled with permanent occupation. Now, ultimately, it is up to the Israelis and Palestinians to take action. No peace can be imposed upon them -- not by the United States; not by anybody else. But endless delay wont make the problem go away. What America and the international community can do is to state frankly what everyone knows -- a lasting peace will involve two states for two peoples: Israel as a Jewish state and the homeland for the Jewish people, and the state of Palestine as the homeland for the Palestinian people, each state enjoying self-determination, mutual recognition, and peace. So while the core issues of the conflict must be negotiated, the basis of those negotiations is clear: a viable Palestine, a secure Israel. The United States believes that negotiations should result in two states, with permanent Palestinian borders with Israel, Jordan, and Egypt, and permanent Israeli borders with Palestine. We believe the borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps, so that secure and recognized borders are established for both states. The Palestinian people must have the right to govern themselves, and reach their full potential, in a sovereign and contiguous state. As for security, every state has the right to self-defense, and Israel must be able to defend itself -- by itself -- against any threat. Provisions must also be robust enough to prevent a resurgence of terrorism, to stop the infiltration of weapons, and to provide effective border security. The full and phased withdrawal of Israeli military forces should be coordinated with the assumption of Palestinian security responsibility in a sovereign, non-militarized state. And the duration of this transition period must be agreed, and the effectiveness of security arrangements must be demonstrated. These principles provide a foundation for negotiations. Palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state; Israelis should know that their basic security concerns will be met. Im aware that these steps alone will not resolve the conflict, because two wrenching and emotional issues will remain: the future of Jerusalem, and the fate of Palestinian refugees. But moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair, and that respects the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. Now, let me say this: Recognizing that negotiations need to begin with the issues of territory and security does not mean that it will be easy to come back to the table. In particular, the recent announcement of an agreement between Fatah and Hamas raises profound and legitimate questions for Israel: How can one negotiate with a party that has shown itself unwilling to recognize your right to exist?", "filename": "19May2011SpeechonAmericanDiplomacyinMiddleEastandNorthAfrica.txt"}, {"question": "Wilson for his outstanding leadership, and the Board of Trustees.

I also have to say that you all are going to get wet. And I'd be out there with you if I could.  But Secret Service gets nervous.  So I'm going to have to stay here, dry.  But know that I'm there with you in spirit. Some of you are graduating summa cum laude.  Some of you are graduating magna cum laude.  I know some of you are just graduating, thank you, Lordy.  That's appropriate because its a Sunday. I see some moms and grandmas here, aunts, in their Sunday best -- although they are upset about their hair getting messed up. Michelle would not be sitting in the rain.  She has taught me about hair. I want to congratulate all of you -- the parents, the   grandparents, the brothers and sisters, the family and friends who supported these young men in so many ways.  This is your day, as well.  Just think about it -- your sons, your brothers, your nephews -- they spent the last four years far from home and close to Spelman, and yet they are still here today. So youve done something right.  Graduates, give a big round of applause to your family for everything that theyve done for you. I know that some of you had to wait in long lines to get into todays ceremony.  And I would apologize, but it did not have anything to do with security.  Those graduates just wanted you to know what its like to register for classes here.  And this time of year brings a different kind of stress -- every senior stopping by Gloster Hall over the past week making sure your name was actually on the list of students who met all the graduation requirements.  If it wasn't on the list, you had to figure out why.  Was it that library book you lent to that trifling roommate who didnt return it?  Was it Dr. Johnsons policy class?  Did you get enough Crown Forum credits? On that last point, Im going to exercise my power as President to declare this speech sufficient Crown Forum credits for any otherwise eligible student to graduate.  That is my graduation gift to you.  You have a special dispensation. Now, graduates, I am humbled to stand here with all of you as an honorary Morehouse Man.  I finally made it.  And as I do, Im mindful of an old saying: You can always tell a Morehouse Man -- but you cant tell him much.  And that makes my task a little more difficult, I suppose.  But I think it also reflects the sense of pride thats always been part of this schools tradition.  Benjamin Mays, who served as the president of Morehouse for almost 30 years, understood that tradition better than anybody.  He said -- and I quote -- It will not be sufficient for Morehouse College, for any college, for that matter, to produce clever graduates but rather honest men, men who can be trusted in public and private life -- men who are sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society and who are willing to accept responsibility for correcting [those] ills. It was that mission -- not just to educate men, but to cultivate good men, strong men, upright men -- that brought community leaders together just two years after the end of the Civil War.  They assembled a list of 37 men, free blacks and freed slaves, who would make up the first prospective class of what later became Morehouse College.  Most of those first students had a desire to become teachers and preachers -- to better themselves so they could help others do the same.  A century and a half later, times have changed.  But the Morehouse Mystique still endures.  Some of you probably came here from communities where everybody looked like you.  Others may have come here in search of a community.  And I suspect that some of you probably felt a little bit of culture shock the first time you came together as a class in Kings Chapel.  All of a sudden, you werent the only high school sports captain, you werent the only student council president.  You were suddenly in a group of high achievers, and that meant you were expected to do something more.  Thats the unique sense of purpose that this place has always infused -- the conviction that this is a training ground not only for individual success, but for leadership that can change the world.   Dr. King was just 15 years old when he enrolled here at Morehouse.  He was an unknown, undersized, unassuming young freshman who lived at home with his parents.  And I think its fair to say he wasnt the coolest kid on campus -- for the suits he wore, his classmates called him Tweed.  But his education at Morehouse helped to forge the intellect, the discipline, the compassion, the soul force that would transform America.  It was here that he was introduced to the writings of Gandhi and Thoreau, and the theory of civil disobedience.  It was here that professors encouraged him to look past the world as it was and fight for the world as it should be.  And it was here, at Morehouse, as Dr. King later wrote, where I realized that nobodywas afraid.  Not even of some bad weather.  I added on that part.  I know its wet out there.  But Dr. Wilson told me you all had a choice and decided to do it out here anyway.  That's a Morehouse Man talking.     Now, think about it.  For black men in the 40s and the 50s, the threat of violence, the constant humiliations, large and small, the uncertainty that you could support a family, the gnawing doubts born of the Jim Crow culture that told you every day that somehow you were inferior, the temptation to shrink from the world, to accept your place, to avoid risks, to be afraid -- that temptation was necessarily strong.  And yet, here, under the tutelage of men like Dr. Mays, young Martin learned to be unafraid.  And he, in turn, taught others to be unafraid.  And over time, he taught a nation to be unafraid.  And over the last 50 years, thanks to the moral force of Dr. King and a Moses generation that overcame their fear and their cynicism and their despair, barriers have come tumbling down, and new doors of opportunity have swung open, and laws and hearts and minds have been changed to the point where someone who looks just like you can somehow come to serve as President of these United States of America. So the history we share should give you hope.  The future we share should give you hope.  Youre graduating into an improving job market.  Youre living in a time when advances in technology and communication put the world at your fingertips.  Your generation is uniquely poised for success unlike any generation of African Americans that came before it. But that doesnt mean we dont have work -- because if were honest with ourselves, we know that too few of our brothers have the opportunities that youve had here at Morehouse.  In troubled neighborhoods all across this country -- many of them heavily African American -- too few of our citizens have role models to guide them.  Communities just a couple miles from my house in Chicago, communities just a couple miles from here -- theyre places where jobs are still too scarce and wages are still too low; where schools are underfunded and violence is pervasive; where too many of our men spend their youth not behind a desk in a classroom, but hanging out on the streets or brooding behind a jail cell.  My job, as President, is to advocate for policies that generate more opportunity for everybody -- policies that strengthen the middle class and give more people the chance to climb their way into the middle class.  Policies that create more good jobs and reduce poverty, and educate more children, and give more families the security of health care, and protect more of our children from the horrors of gun violence.  That's my job.  Those are matters of public policy, and it is important for all of us -- black, white and brown -- to advocate for an America where everybody has got a fair shot in life.  Not just some.  Not just a few. But along with collective responsibilities, we have individual responsibilities.  There are some things, as black men, we can only do for ourselves.  There are some things, as Morehouse Men, that you are obliged to do for those still left behind.  As Morehouse Men, you now wield something even more powerful than the diploma youre about to collect -- and thats the power of your example. So what I ask of you today is the same thing I ask of every graduating class I address:  Use that power for something larger than yourself.  Live up to President Mayss challenge.  Be sensitive to the wrongs, the sufferings, and the injustices of society.  And be willing to accept responsibility for correcting [those] ills. I know that some of you came to Morehouse from communities where life was about keeping your head down and looking out for yourself.  Maybe you feel like you escaped, and now you can take your degree and get that fancy job and the nice house and the nice car -- and never look back.  And dont get me wrong -- with all those student loans youve had to take out, I know youve got to earn some money.   With doors open to you that your parents and grandparents could not even imagine, no one expects you to take a vow of poverty.  But I will say it betrays a poverty of ambition if all you think about is what goods you can buy instead of what good you can do. So, yes, go get that law degree.  But if you do, ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and the powerful, or if you can also find some time to defend the powerless.  Sure, go get your MBA, or start that business.  We need black businesses out there.  But ask yourselves what broader purpose your business might serve, in putting people to work, or transforming a neighborhood.  The most successful CEOs I know didnt start out intent just on making money -- rather, they had a vision of how their product or service would change things, and the money followed. Some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors.  But make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it, too.  For generations, certain groups in this country -- especially African Americans -- have been desperate in need of access to quality, affordable health care.  And as a society, were finally beginning to change that.  Those of you who are under the age of 26 already have the option to stay on your parents health care plan.  But all of you are heading into an economy where many young people expect not only to have multiple jobs, but multiple careers.  So starting October 1st, because of the Affordable Care Act -- otherwise known as Obamacare -- youll be able to shop for a quality, affordable plan thats yours and travels with you -- a plan that will insure not only your health, but your dreams if you are sick or get in an accident.  But we're going to need some doctors to make sure it works, too.  We've got to make sure everybody has good health in this country.  Its not just good for you, its good for this country.  So you're going to have to spread the word to your fellow young people.  Which brings me to a second point:  Just as Morehouse has taught you to expect more of yourselves, inspire those who look up to you to expect more of themselves.  We know that too many young men in our community continue to make bad choices.  And I have to say, growing up, I made quite a few myself.  Sometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down.  I had a tendency sometimes to make excuses for me not doing the right thing.  But one of the things that all of you have learned over the last four years is theres no longer any room for excuses. I understand theres a common fraternity creed here at Morehouse: Excuses are tools of the incompetent used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness.  Well, weve got no time for excuses.  Not because the bitter legacy of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not.  Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there.  Its just that in todays hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil -- many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did -- all of them entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned. Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was.  Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination.  And moreover, you have to remember that whatever youve gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured -- and they overcame them.  And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too. You now hail from a lineage and legacy of immeasurably strong men -- men who bore tremendous burdens and still laid the stones for the path on which we now walk.  You wear the mantle of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, and Ralph Bunche and Langston Hughes, and George Washington Carver and Ralph Abernathy and Thurgood Marshall, and, yes, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  These men were many things to many people.  And they knew full well the role that racism played in their lives.  But when it came to their own accomplishments and sense of purpose, they had no time for excuses. Every one of you have a grandma or an uncle or a parent whos told you that at some point in life, as an African American, you have to work twice as hard as anyone else if you want to get by.  I think President Mays put it even better:  He said, Whatever you do, strive to do it so well that no man living and no man dead, and no man yet to be born can do it any better. And I promise you, what was needed in Dr. Mayss time, that spirit of excellence, and hard work, and dedication, and no excuses is needed now more than ever.  If you think you can just get over in this economy just because you have a Morehouse degree, youre in for a rude awakening.  But if you stay hungry, if you keep hustling, if you keep on your grind and get other folks to do the same -- nobody can stop you. And when I talk about pursuing excellence and setting an example, Im not just talking about in your professional life.  One of todays graduates, Frederick Anderson -- wheres Frederick?  Frederick, right here. I know its raining, but I'm going to tell about Frederick.  Frederick  started his college career in Ohio, only to find out that his high school sweetheart back in Georgia was pregnant.  So he came back and enrolled in Morehouse to be closer to her.  Pretty soon, helping raise a newborn and working night shifts became too much, so he started taking business classes at a technical college instead -- doing everything from delivering newspapers to buffing hospital floors to support his family. And then he enrolled at Morehouse a second time.  But even with a job, he couldnt keep up with the cost of tuition.  So after getting his degree from that technical school, this father of three decided to come back to Morehouse for a third time.  As Frederick says, God has a plan for my life, and Hes not done with me yet. And today, Frederick is a family man, and a working man, and a Morehouse Man.  And thats what Im asking all of you to do:  Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man. Be the best husband to your wife, or youre your boyfriend, or your partner.  Be the best father you can be to your children.  Because nothing is more important. I was raised by a heroic single mom, wonderful grandparents -- made incredible sacrifices for me.  And I know there are moms and grandparents here today who did the same thing for all of you.  But I sure wish I had had a father who was not only present, but involved.  Didnt know my dad.  And so my whole life, Ive tried to be for Michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me.  I want to break that cycle where a father is not at home -- where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter.  I want to be a better father, a better husband, a better man. Its hard work that demands your constant attention and frequent sacrifice.  And I promise you, Michelle will tell you Im not perfect.  Shes got a long list of my imperfections.  Even now, Im still practicing, I'm still learning, still getting corrected in terms of how to be a fine husband and a good father.  But I will tell you this:  Everything else is unfulfilled if we fail at family, if we fail at that responsibility. I know that when I am on my deathbed someday, I will not be thinking about any particular legislation I passed; I will not be thinking about a policy I promoted; I will not be thinking about the speech I gave, I will not be thinking the Nobel Prize I received.  I will be thinking about that walk I took with my daughters.  I'll be thinking about a lazy afternoon with my wife. I'll be thinking about sitting around the dinner table and seeing them happy and healthy and knowing that they were loved.  And I'll be thinking about whether I did right by all of them. So be a good role model, set a good example for that young brother coming up.  If you know somebody whos not on point, go back and bring that brother along -- those whove been left behind, who havent had the same opportunities we have -- they need to hear from you.  Youve got to be engaged on the barbershops, on the basketball court, at church, spend time and energy and presence to give people opportunities and a chance.  Pull them up, expose them, support their dreams.  Don't put them down. Weve got to teach them just like what we have to learn, what it means to be a man -- to serve your city like Maynard Jackson; to shape the culture like Spike Lee; to be like Chester Davenport, one of the first people to integrate the University of Georgia Law School.  When he got there, nobody would sit next to him in class.  But Chester didnt mind.  Later on, he said, It was the thing for me to do.  Someone needed to be the first.  And today, Chester is here celebrating his 50th reunion.  Where is Chester Davenport?  Hes here. So if youve had role models, fathers, brothers like that -- thank them today. And if you havent, commit yourself to being that man to somebody else. And finally, as you do these things, do them not just for yourself, but don't even do them just for the African American community.  I want you to set your sights higher.  At the turn of the last century, W.E.B. DuBois spoke about the talented tenth -- a class of highly educated, socially conscious leaders in the black community.  But its not just the African American community that needs you.  The country needs you.  The world needs you. As Morehouse Men, many of you know what its like to be an outsider; know what its like to be marginalized; know what its like to feel the sting of discrimination.  And thats an experience that a lot of Americans share.  Hispanic Americans know that feeling when somebody asks them where they come from or tell them to go back.  Gay and lesbian Americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love that they share.  Muslim Americans feel it when theyre stared at with suspicion because of their faith.  Any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work -- she knows what its like to be on the outside looking in. So your experiences give you special insight that todays leaders need.  If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy -- the understanding of what its like to walk in somebody elses shoes, to see through their eyes, to know what its like when you're not born on 3rd base, thinking you hit a triple.  It should give you the ability to connect.  It should give you a sense of compassion and what it means to overcome barriers. And I will tell you, Class of 2013, whatever success I have achieved, whatever positions of leadership I have held have depended less on Ivy League degrees or SAT scores or GPAs, and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy -- the special obligation I felt, as a black man like you, to help those who need it most, people who didnt have the opportunities that I had -- because there but for the grace of God, go I -- I might have been in their shoes.  I might have been in prison.  I might have been unemployed.  I might not have been able to support a family.  And that motivates me. So its up to you to widen your circle of concern -- to care about justice for everybody, white, black and brown. Everybody.  Not just in your own community, but also across this country and around the world.  To make sure everyone has a voice, and everybody gets a seat at the table; that everybody, no matter what you look like or where you come from, what your last name is -- it doesnt matter, everybody gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they are willing to work hard enough. When Leland Shelton was four years old -- wheres Leland?", "filename": "19May2013MorehouseCollegeCommencementAddress.txt"}, {"question": "But theyve got to be part of a larger plan thats balanced - a plan that asks the most fortunate among us to pay their fair share, just like everybody else. And thats why this plan eliminates tax loopholes that primarily go to the wealthiest taxpayers and biggest corporations - tax breaks that small businesses and middle-class families dont get.  And if tax reform doesn't get done, this plan asks the wealthiest Americans to go back to paying the same rates that they paid during the 1990s, before the Bush tax cuts. I promise its not because anybody looks forward to the prospects of raising taxes or paying more taxes.  I dont.  In fact, Ive cut taxes for the middle class and for small businesses, and through the American Jobs Act, wed cut taxes again to promote hiring and put more money into the pockets of people.  But we cant afford these special lower rates for the wealthy - rates, by the way, that were meant to be temporary.  Back when these first -- these tax cuts, back in 2001, 2003, were being talked about, they were talked about temporary measures.  We cant afford them when were running these big deficits. Now, I am also ready to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform our entire tax code, to get rid of the decades of accumulated loopholes, special interest carve-outs, and other tax expenditures that stack the deck against small business owners and ordinary families who cant afford Washington lobbyists or fancy accountants.  Our tax code is more than 10,000 pages long. If you stack up all the volumes, theyre almost five feet tall.  That means that how much you pay often depends less on what you make and more on how well you can game the system, and that's especially true of the corporate tax code. Weve got one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, but its riddled with exceptions and special interest loopholes.  So some companies get out paying a lot of taxes, while the rest of them end up having to foot the bill.  And this makes our entire economy less competitive and our country a less desirable place to do business.  That has to change.  Our tax code shouldnt give an advantage to companies with the best-connected lobbyists.  It should give an advantage to companies that invest in the United States of America and create jobs in the United States of America.  And we can lower the corporate rate if we get rid of all these special deals. So I am ready, I am eager, to work with Democrats and Republicans to reform the tax code to make it simpler, make it fairer, and make America more competitive.  But any reform plan will have to raise revenue to help close our deficit.  That has to be part of the formula.  And any reform should follow another simple principle:  Middle-class families shouldnt pay higher taxes than millionaires and billionaires.  Thats pretty straightforward.  Its hard to argue against that.  Warren Buffetts secretary shouldnt pay a higher tax rate than Warren Buffett.  There is no justification for it.  It is wrong that in the United States of America, a teacher or a nurse or a construction worker who earns $50,000 should pay higher tax rates than somebody pulling in $50 million.  Anybody who says we cant change the tax code to correct that, anyone who has signed some pledge to protect every single tax loophole so long as they live, they should be called out.  They should have to defend that unfairness -- explain why somebody who's making  $50 million a year in the financial markets should be paying 15 percent on their taxes, when a teacher making $50,000 a year is paying more than that -- paying a higher rate.  They ought to have to answer for it.  And if theyre pledged to keep that kind of unfairness in place, they should remember, the last time I checked the only pledge that really matters is the pledge we take to uphold the Constitution.  Now, were already hearing the usual defenders of these kinds of loopholes saying this is just class warfare.  I reject the idea that asking a hedge fund manager to pay the same tax rate as a plumber or a teacher is class warfare.  I think its just the right the thing to do.  I believe the American middle class, who've been pressured relentlessly for decades, believe its time that they were fought for as hard as the lobbyists and some lawmakers have fought to protect special treatment for billionaires and big corporations. Nobody wants to punish success in America.  Whats great about this country is our belief that anyone can make it and everybody should be able to try - the idea that any one of us can open a business or have an idea and make us millionaires or billionaires.  This is the land of opportunity.  Thats great.  All Im saying is that those who have done well, including me, should pay our fair share in taxes to contribute to the nation that made our success possible.  We shouldnt get a better deal than ordinary families get.  And I think most wealthy Americans would agree if they knew this would help us grow the economy and deal with the debt that threatens our future. It comes down to this:  We have to prioritize.  Both parties agree that we need to reduce the deficit by the same amount -- by $4 trillion.  So what choices are we going to make to reach that goal?", "filename": "19September2011SpeechonEconomicGrowthandDeficitReduction.txt"}, {"question": "On the challenges of our times, from giving workers a raise to getting families health coverage; on the threats of our time, from climate change to nuclear proliferation -- members of the CBC have been leaders moving America forward.  With your help, our businesses have created over 13 million new jobs.  With your help, weve covered more than 16 million Americans with health insurance -- many for the first time.  Three years ago, Republicans said theyd get the unemployment rate down to 6 percent by 2017.  Its down to 5.1 right now.  You didnt hear much about that at the debate on Monday -- on Wednesday night. The point is, though, none of this progress would have been possible without the CBC taking tough votes when it mattered most.  Whatever Ive accomplished, the CBC has been there.  I was proud to be a CBC member when I was in the Senate, and Im proud to be your partner today.  But were not here just to celebrate -- were here to keep going.  Because with the unemployment rate for African Americans still more than double than whites, with millions of families still working hard and still waiting to feel the recovery in their own lives, we know that the promise of this nation -- where every single American, regardless of the circumstances in which they were born, regardless of what they look like, where they come from, has the chance to succeed -- that promise is not yet fulfilled. The good thing about America -- the great project of America is that perfecting our union is never finished.  Weve always got more work to do.  And tonights honorees remind us of that.  They remind us of the courage and sacrifices, the work that theyve done -- and not just at the national level, but in local communities all across the country.  We couldnt be prouder of them.  The heroes of the Civil Rights Movement whom we lost last month remind us of the work that remains to be done.  American heroes like Louis Stokes, and Julian Bond, and Amelia Boynton Robinson. Ms. Robinson -- as some of you know, earlier this year, my family and I joined many in Selma for the 50th anniversary of that march.  And as we crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I held Ms. Amelias hand.  And I thought about her and all the extraordinary women like her who were really the life force of the movement.  Women were the foot soldiers.  Women strategized boycotts.  Women organized marches.  Even if they werent allowed to run the civil rights organizations on paper, behind the scenes they were the thinkers and the doers making things happen each and every day -- doing the work that nobody else wanted to do.  They couldnt prophesize from the pulpits, but they led the charge from the pews.  They were no strangers to violence.  They were on the front lines.  So often they were subject to abuse, dehumanized, but kept on going, holding families together.  Mothers were beaten and gassed on Bloody Sunday.  Four little girls were murdered in a Birmingham church.  Women made the movement happen. Of course, black women have been a part of every great movement in American history -- even if they werent always given a voice.  They helped plan the March on Washington, but were almost entirely absent from the program.  And when pressed, male organizers added a tribute highlighting six women -- none of them who were asked to make a speech.  Daisy Bates introduced her fellow honorees in just 142 words, written by a man.  Of course, Marian Anderson and Mahalia Jackson sang.  But in a three-hour program, the men gave women just 142 words.  That may sound familiar to some of the women in the room here tonight.  The organizers even insisted on two separate parades -- male leaders marching along the main route on Pennsylvania Avenue, and leaders like Dorothy Height and Rosa Parks relegated to Independence Avenue.  Americas most important march against segregation had its own version of separation. Black women were central in the fight for womens rights, from suffrage to the feminist movement -- and yet despite their leadership, too often they were also marginalized.  But they didnt give up, they didnt let up.  They were too fierce for that.  Black women have always understood the words of Pauli Murray -- that Hope is a song in a weary throat. Its thanks to black women that weve come a long way since the days when a girl like Ruby Bridges couldnt go to school.  When a woman like Amelia couldnt cast her vote.  When we didnt have a Congressional Black Caucus -- and its 20 women members. So Im focusing on women tonight because I want them to know how much we appreciate them, how much we admire them, how much we love them.  And I want to talk about what more we have to do to provide full opportunity and equality for our black women and girls in America today. Because all of us are beneficiaries of a long line of strong black women who helped carry this country forward.  Their work to expand civil rights opened the doors of opportunity, not just for African Americans but for all women, for all of us -- black and white, Latino and Asian, LGBT and straight, for our First Americans and our newest Americans.  And their contributions in every field -- as scientists and entrepreneurs, educators, explorers -- all made us stronger.  Of course, theyre also a majority of my household.  So I care deeply about how theyre doing. The good news is, despite structural barriers of race and gender, women and girls of color have made real progress in recent years.  The number of black women-owned businesses has skyrocketed.  Black women have ascended the ranks of every industry.  Teen pregnancy rates among girls of color are down, while high school and four-year college graduation rates are up.  Thats good news. But theres no denying that black women and girls still face real and persistent challenges.  The unemployment rate is over 8 percent for black women.  And theyre overrepresented in low-paying jobs; underrepresented in management.  They often lack access to economic necessities like paid leave and quality, affordable child care.  They often dont get the same quality health care that they need, and have higher rates of certain chronic diseases -- although thats starting to change with Obamacare.  Its working, by the way, people.  Just in case -- just in case you needed to know. And then there are some of the challenges that are harder to see and harder to talk about -- although Michelle, our outstanding, beautiful First Lady talks about these struggles.  Michelle will tell stories about when she was younger, people telling her she shouldnt aspire to go to the very best universities.  And she found herself thinking sometimes, Well, maybe theyre right.  Even after she earned two degrees from some of the best universities in America, she still faced the doubts that were rooted in deep social prejudice and stereotypes, worrying whether she was being too assertive, or too angry, or too tall.  I like tall women. And those stereotypes and social pressures, they still affect our girls.  So we all have to be louder than the voices that are telling our girls theyre not good enough -- that theyve got to look a certain way, or theyve got to act a certain way, or set their goals at a certain level.  Weve got to affirm their sense of self-worth, and make them feel visible and beautiful, and understood and loved.  And I say this as a father who strives to do this at home, but I also say this as a citizen.  This is not just about my family or yours; its about who we are as a people, who we want to be, and how we can make sure that America is fulfilling its promise -- because everybody is getting a chance, and everybody is told theyre important, and everybody is given opportunity.  And we got to do more than just say we care, or say we put a woman on ten-dollar bill, although thats a good idea.  Weve got to make sure theyre getting some ten-dollar bills; that theyre getting paid properly.  Weve got to let our actions do the talking. It is an affront to the very idea of America when certain segments of our population dont have access to the same opportunities as everybody else.  It makes a mockery of our economy when black women make 30 fewer cents for every dollar a white man earns.  That adds up to thousands of dollars in missed income that determines whether a family can pay for a home, or pay for college for their kids, or save for retirement, or give their kids a better life.

This morning, we learned that over the summer, our economy grew at its strongest pace in nearly two years.  The unemployment rate has steadily fallen to its lowest point in five years.  Our tax code is fairer, and our fiscal situation is firmer, with deficits that are now less than half of what they were when I took office.  For the first time in nearly two decades, we now produce more oil here at home than we buy from the rest of the world, and our all-of-the-above strategy for new American energy means lower energy costs.  The Affordable Care Act has helped keep health care costs growing at their slowest rate in 50 years.  Combined, that means bigger paychecks for middle-class families and bigger savings for businesses looking to invest and hire here in America. And for all the challenges we've had and all the challenges that we've been working on diligently in dealing with both the ACA and the website these past couple months, more than half a million Americans have enrolled through healthcare.gov in the first three weeks of December alone.  In California, for example, a state operating its own marketplace, more than 15,000 Americans are enrolling every single day.  And in the federal website, tens of thousands are enrolling every single day.  Since October 1st, more than one million Americans have selected new health insurance plans through the federal and state marketplaces.  So, all told, millions of Americans, despite the problems with the website, are now poised to be covered by quality, affordable health insurance come New Year's Day.  Now, this holiday season, there are mothers and fathers and entrepreneurs and workers who have something new to celebrate -- the security of knowing that when the unexpected or misfortune strikes, hardship no longer has to. And you add that all up and what it means is we head into next year with an economy that's stronger than it was when we started the year.  More Americans are finding work and experiencing the pride of a paycheck.  Our businesses are positioned for new growth and new jobs.  And I firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America.  But as I outlined in detail earlier this month, we all know there's a lot more that we're going to have to do to restore opportunity and broad-based growth for every American.  And that's going to require some action. It's a good start that earlier this week, for the first time in years, both parties in both houses of Congress came together to pass a budget.  That unwinds some of the damaging sequester cuts that created headwinds for our economy.  It clears the path for businesses and for investments that we need to strengthen our middle class, like education and scientific research.  And it means that the American people won't be exposed to the threat of another reckless shutdown every few months.  So that's a good thing. It's probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship.  But it's also fair to say that we're not condemned to endless gridlock.  There are areas where we can work together. I believe that work should begin with something that Republicans in Congress should have done before leaving town this week, and that's restoring the temporary insurance that helps folks make ends meet when they are looking for a job.  Because Congress didn't act, more than one million of their constituents will lose a vital economic lifeline at Christmastime, leaving a lot of job-seekers without any source of income at all. I think we're a better country than that.  We don't abandon each other when times are tough.  Keep in mind unemployment insurance only goes to folks who are actively looking for work -- a mom who needs help feeding her kids when she sends out her resumes, or a dad who needs help paying the rent while working part-time and still earning the skills he needs for that new job. So when Congress comes back to work, their first order of business should be making this right.  I know a bipartisan group is working on a three-month extension of this insurance.  They should pass it, and I'll sign it right away. Let me repeat:  I think 2014 needs to be a year of action.  We've got work to do to create more good jobs, to help more Americans earn the skills and education they need to do those jobs and to make sure that those jobs offer the wages and benefits that let families build a little bit of financial security.  We still have the task of finishing the fix on our broken immigration system.  We've got to build on the progress we've painstakingly made over these last five years with respect to our economy and offer the middle class and all those who are looking to join the middle class a better opportunity, and that's going to be where I focus all of my efforts in the year ahead. And let me conclude by saying just as we're strengthening our position here at home, we're also standing up for our interests around the world.  This year, we've demonstrated that with clear-eyed, principled diplomacy, we can pursue new paths to a world that's more secure -- a future where Iran does not build a nuclear weapon; a future where Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles are destroyed.  By the end of next year, the war in Afghanistan will be over, just as we've ended our war in Iraq, and we'll continue to bring our troops home.  And, as always, we will remain vigilant to protect our homeland and our personnel overseas from terrorist attacks. Of course, a lot of our men and women in uniform are still overseas, and a lot of them are still spending their Christmas far away from their family and their friends, and in some cases, are still in harm's way.  So I want to close by saying to them and their families back home, we want to thank you.  Your country stands united in supporting you and being grateful for your service and your sacrifice.  We will keep you in our thoughts and in our prayers during this season of hope. So, before I wish a Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night, I will take some questions.  Jay prepared a list of who's naughty and nice -- so we'll see who made it. Julie must be nice.  Julie Pace. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Despite all of the data points that you cited in your opening statement, when you look back at this year, very little of the domestic agenda that you outlined in your inaugural address and your State of the Union have been achieved.  Health care rollout obviously had huge problems and your ratings from the public are near historic lows for you.  When you take this altogether, has this been the worst year of your presidency? President Obama:  I've got to tell you, Julie, that's not how I think about it.  I have now been in office five years -- close to five years -- was running for President for two years before that, and for those of you who've covered me during that time, we have had ups and we have had downs.  I think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near-death experiences.  And what I've been focused on each and every day is are we moving the ball in helping the American people -- families -- have more opportunity, have a little more security to feel as if, if they work hard, they can get ahead. And if I look at this past year, there are areas where there obviously have been some frustrations, where I wish Congress had moved more aggressively.  Not passing background checks in the wake of Newtown is something that I continue to believe was a mistake.  But then I also look at because of the debate that occurred, all the work that's been done at state levels to increase gun safety and to make sure that we don't see tragedies like that happen again. There's a lot of focus on legislative activity at the congressional level, but even when Congress doesn't move on things they should move on, there are a whole bunch of things that we're still doing.  So we don't always get attention for it, but the ConnectEd program that we announced where we're going to be initiating wireless capacity in every classroom in America will make a huge difference for kids all across this country, and for teachers. A manufacturing hub that we set up in Youngstown, something that I talked about during the State of the Union, is going to create innovation and connect universities, manufacturers, job training to help create a renaissance -- build on the renaissance that we're seeing in manufacturing. When it comes to energy, this year is going to be the first year in a very long time where we're producing more oil and natural gas here in this country than we're importing.  That's a big deal. So I understand the point that you're getting at, Julie, which is that a lot of our legislative initiatives in Congress have not moved forward as rapidly as I'd like.  I completely understand that, which means that I'm going to keep at it.  And if you look at, for example, immigration reform, probably the biggest thing that I wanted to get done this year, we saw progress.  It passed the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote.  There are indications in the House that even though it did not get completed this year that there is a commitment on the part of the Speaker to try to move forward legislation early next year.  And the fact that it didn't hit the timeline that I'd prefer is obviously frustrating but it's not something that I end up brooding a lot about. Q:  But, sir, it's not just your legislative agenda.  When you look at polling and you talk to Americans, they seem to have lost confidence in you, trust in you.  Your credibility has taken a hit.  Obviously the health care law was a big part of that.  So do you understand that the public has changed in some way their view of you over this year? President Obama:  But, Julie, I guess what I'm saying is if you're measuring this by polls, my polls have gone up and down a lot through the course of my career.  I mean, if I was interested in polling, I wouldn't have run for President.  I was polling at 70 percent when I was in the U.S. Senate.  I took this job to deliver for the American people.  And I knew and will continue to know that there are going to be ups and downs on it. You're right, the health care website problems were a source of great frustration.  I think in the last press conference I adequately discussed my frustrations on those.  On the other hand, since that time I now have a couple million people, maybe more, who are going to have health care on January 1st.  And that is a big deal.  That's why I ran for this office. And as long as I've got an opportunity every single day to make sure that in ways large and small I'm creating greater opportunity for people -- more kids are able to go to school, get the education they need; more families are able to stabilize their finances; the housing market is continuing to improve; people feel like their wages maybe are inching up a little bit -- if those things are happening, I'll take it. And I've said before, I've run my last political race.  So at this point, my goal every single day is just to make sure that I can look back and say we're delivering something -- not everything, because this is a long haul. Mark Felsenthal. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  One of the most significant events of this year was the revelation of the surveillance by the National Security Agency.  As you review how to rein in the National Security Agency, a federal judge said that, for example, the government had failed to cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA's bulk metadata actually stopped an imminent attack.  Are you able to identify any specific examples when it did so?  Are you convinced that the collection of that data is useful to national security and should continue as it is? President Obama:  Let me talk more broadly, and then I'll talk specifically about the program you're referring to. As you know, the independent panel that I put together came back with a series of recommendations, 46 in total.  I had an extensive meeting with them down in the Situation Room to review all the recommendations that they had made.  I want to thank them publicly, because I think they did an excellent job and took my charge very seriously, which is I told them I want you to look from top to bottom at what we're doing and evaluate whether or not the current structures that we have and the current programs that we have are properly addressing both our continuing need to keep ourselves secure and to prevent terrorist attacks, or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or other threats to the homeland, and are we also making sure that we're taking seriously rule of law and our concerns about privacy and civil liberties. So what we're doing now is evaluating all the recommendations that have been made.  Over the next several weeks, I'm going to assess based on conversations not just with the intelligence community but others in government and outside of government how we might apply and incorporate their recommendations.  And I'm going to make a pretty definitive statement about all of this in January where I'll be able to say, here are the recommendations that we think make sense; here are ones that we think are promising but still need to be refined further; here's how it relates to the work we're doing not just internally but also in partnership with other countries.  And so I'm taking this very seriously because I think, as I've said before, this is a debate that needed to be had. One specific program, the 215 program, is the metadata, the bulk collection of phone numbers and exchanges that have taken place that has probably gotten the most attention, at least with respect to domestic audiences.  And what I've said in the past continues to be the case, which is that the NSA, in executing this program, believed, based on experiences from 9/11, that it was important for us to be able to track if there was a phone number of a known terrorist outside of the United States calling into the United States, where that call might have gone, and that having that data in one place and retained for a certain period of time allowed them to be confident in pursuing various investigations of terrorist threats. And I think it's important to note that in all the reviews of this program that have been done, in fact, there have not been actual instances where it's been alleged that the NSA in some ways acted inappropriately in the use of this data.  But what is also clear is from the public debate, people are concerned about the prospect, the possibility of abuse.  And I think that's what the judge and the district court suggested.  And although his opinion obviously differs from rulings on the FISA Court, we're taking those into account. The question we're going to have to ask is can we accomplish the same goals that this program is intended to accomplish in ways that give the public more confidence that, in fact, the NSA is doing what it's supposed to be doing.  I have confidence in the fact that the NSA is not engaging in domestic surveillance or snooping around, but I also recognize that as technologies change and people can start running algorithms and programs that map out all the information that we're downloading on a daily basis into our telephones and our computers, that we may have to refine this further to give people more confidence.  And I'm going to be working very hard on doing that. And we've got to provide more confidence to the international community.  In some ways, what has been more challenging is the fact that we do have a lot of laws and checks and balances and safeguards and audits when it comes to making sure that the NSA and other intelligence agencies are not spying on Americans.  We've had less legal constraint in terms of what we're doing internationally.  But I think part of what's been interesting about this whole exercise is recognizing that in a virtual world, some of these boundaries don't matter anymore, and just because we can do something doesn't mean we necessarily should.  And the values that we've got as Americans are ones that we have to be willing to apply beyond our borders I think perhaps more systematically than we've done in the past. Okay?  Ed Henry. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I want to follow up on that because -- and merry Christmas, by the way. President Obama:  Merry Christmas to you. Q:  When Edward Snowden first started leaking the information, you made a statement on June 7th in California, and you claimed to the American people that you had already reformed many of these surveillance programs.  You said you came into office -- \"my team evaluated them, we scrubbed them thoroughly, we actually expanded some of the oversight,\" and you did expand some of it. President Obama:  Yes. Q:  You also said we may have to rebalance some, there may be changes.  But you concluded with, \"You can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok.  But when you actually look at the details, then I think we've struck the right balance.\"  That was only six months ago.  Now this judge is saying no, your own panel is saying no, even you're saying no, we haven't really struck the right balance perhaps, that changes have to be made.  My question is:  Were you wrong then because you were not fully read in not just on these programs but on other programs outside of the ones you just talked about, where we were potentially listening in on the German leaders, the Brazilian leaders and others, that suggest there were abuses?  Number one. And number two, if you were fully read in on these programs, is it another example of what Julie was getting at with this question of credibility with the American people, that just like on health care, \"you like your plan, you can keep it\"?  On surveillance, you looked the American people in the eye six months ago and said, \"We've got the right balance,\" and six months later you're saying maybe not. President Obama:  Well, hold on a second, Ed.  I think it's important to note that when it comes to the right balance on surveillance, these are a series of judgment calls that we're making every single day, because we've got a whole bunch of folks whose job it is to make sure that the American people are protected.  And that's a hard job, because if something slips, then the question that's coming from you the next day at a press conference is, \"Mr. President, why didn't you catch that?  Why did the intelligence people allow that to slip?  Isn't there a way that we could have found out that in fact this terrorist attack took place?\" Q: So why were you so -- why did you say we struck the right balance? President Obama:  So the point is, Ed, not that my assessment of the 215 program has changed in terms of technically how it works.  What is absolutely clear to me is that given the public debate that's taken place and the disclosures that have taken place over the last several months, that this is only going to work if the American people have confidence and trust. Now, part of the challenge is, is that because of the manner in which these disclosures took place, in dribs and drabs, oftentimes shaded in a particular way, and because of some of the constraints that we've had in terms of declassifying information and getting it out there, that that trust in how many safeguards exist and how these programs are run has been diminished.  So what's going to be important is to build that back up.  And I take that into account in weighing how we structure these programs. So let me just be very specific on the 215 program.  It is possible, for example, that some of the same information that the intelligence community feels is required to keep people safe can be obtained by having the private phone companies keep these records longer and to create some mechanism where they can be accessed in an effective fashion. That might cost more.  There might need to be different checks on how those requests are made.  There may be technological solutions that have to be found to do that.  And the question that we're asking ourselves now is, does that make sense not only because of the fact that there are concerns about potential abuse down the road with the metadata that's being kept by a government rather than private companies, but also does it make sense to do it because people right now are concerned that maybe their phone calls are being listened to, even if they're not?  And we've got to factor that in. So my point is, is that the environment has changed in ways that I think require us to take that into account.  But the analysis that I've been doing throughout has always been periodically looking at what we're doing and asking ourselves, are we doing this in the right way?  Are we making sure that we're keeping the American people safe, number one?  Are we also being true to our civil liberties and our privacy and our values? Q:  I understand it's a tough job, and, God forbid, there's another terror attack, every one of us is going to be second-guessing you, and that is extremely difficult to be in the Oval Office. President Obama:  That's okay.  I volunteered. Q: But as you said, you took that on. President Obama:  Yes. Q:  You put it on your back.  And so my question is do you have any personal regrets?  You're not addressing the fact the public statements you've made to reassure the public -- your Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, months ago went up, got a question from a Democrat, not a Republican, about whether some of this was going on, and he denied it.  Doesn't that undermine the public trust? President Obama:  Ed, you're conflating, first of all, me and Mr. Clapper -- Q:  He's the Director of National -- he's still on the job. President Obama:  I understand.  But what I'm saying is this, that, yes, these are tough problems that I am glad to have the privilege of tackling.  Your initial question was whether the statements that I made six months ago are ones that I don't stand by.  And what I'm saying is, is that the statements I made then are entirely consistent with the statements that I make now, which is that we believed that we had scrubbed these programs and struck an appropriate balance, and there had not been evidence and there continues not to be evidence that the particular program had been abused in how it was used, and that it was a useful tool, working with other tools that the intelligence community has, to ensure that if we have a thread on a potential terrorist threat, that that can be followed effectively. What I've also said, though, is that in light of the disclosures that have taken place, it is clear that whatever benefits the configuration of this particular program may have may be outweighed by the concerns that people have on its potential abuse.  And if that's the case, there may be another way of skinning the cat. So we just keep on going at this stuff and saying, can we do this better?  Can we do this more effectively?  I think that the panel's recommendations are consistent with that.  So if you had a chance to read the overall recommendations, what they were very clear about is we need this intelligence.  We can't unilaterally disarm.  There are ways we can do it potentially that gives people greater assurance that there are checks and balances, that there's sufficient oversight, sufficient transparency.  Programs like 215 could be redesigned in ways that give you the same information when you need it without creating these potentials for abuse. And that's exactly what we should be doing, is to evaluate all these things in a very clear, specific way, and moving forward on changes.  And that's what I intend to do. Q:  So you have no regrets?  You have no regrets? President Obama:  That's what I intend to do. Jon Karl.  Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  It's been a tough year.  You may not want to call it the worst year of your presidency, but it's clearly been a tough year.  The polls have gone up and down, but they are at a low point right now.  So what I'm asking you -- you've acknowledged the difficulties with the health care rollout.  But when you look back and you look at the decisions that you have made and what you did, what you didn't do, for you personally, what do you think has been your biggest mistake? President Obama:  With respect to health care, specifically, or just generally? Q:  The whole thing, back at this tough year. President Obama:  Well, there's no doubt that when it came to the health care rollout, even though I was meeting every other week or every three weeks with folks and emphasizing how important it was that consumers had a good experience, an easy experience in getting the information they need, and knowing what the choices and options were for them to be able to get high-quality, affordable health care, the fact is it didn't happen in the first month, the first six weeks, in a way that was at all acceptable.  And since I'm in charge, obviously we screwed it up. Part of it, as I've said before, had to do with how IT procurement generally is done, and it almost predates this year. Part of it, obviously, has to do with the fact that there were not clear enough lines of authority in terms of who was in charge of the technology and cracking the whip on a whole bunch of contractors.  So there were a whole bunch of things that we've been taking a look at, and I'm going to be making appropriate adjustments once we get through this year and we've gotten through the initial surge of people who've been signing up. But having said all that, bottom line also is, is that we've got several million people who are going to have health care that works.  And it's not that I don't engage in a lot of self-reflection here.  I promise you, I probably beat myself up even worse than you or Ed Henry does on any given day.  But I've also got to wake up in the morning and make sure that I do better the next day, and that we keep moving forward. And when I look at the landscape for next year, what I say to myself is, we're poised to do really good things.  The economy is stronger than it has been in a very long time.  Our next challenge then is to make sure that everybody benefits from that, not just a few folks.  And there are still too many people who haven't seen a raise and are still feeling financially insecure. We can get immigration reform done.  We've got a concept that has bipartisan support.  Let's see if we can break through the politics on this. I think that, hopefully, folks have learned their lesson in terms of brinksmanship, coming out of the government shutdown.  There have been times where I thought about, were there other ways that I could have prevented those three, four weeks that hampered the economy and hurt individual families who were not getting a paycheck during that time -- absolutely.  But I also think that, in some ways, given the pattern that we had been going through with House Republicans for a while, we might have needed just a little bit of a bracing sort of recognition that this is not what the American people think is acceptable.  They want us to try to solve problems and be practical, even if we can't get everything done. So the end of the year is always a good time to reflect and see what can you do better next year.  That's how I intend to approach it.  I'm sure that I will have even better ideas after a couple days of sleep and sun. Brianna. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  On the debt ceiling, your Treasury Secretary has estimated that the U.S. government will lose its ability to pay its bills come late February or early March.  House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan has said that \"Republicans are going to decide what it is they can accomplish on this debt limit fight\" -- his words.  Will you negotiate with House Republicans on the debt ceiling? President Obama:  Oh, Brianna, you know the answer to this question.  No, we're not going to negotiate for Congress to pay bills that it has accrued. Here's the good news -- I want to emphasize the positive as we enter into this holiday season.  I think Congressman Ryan and Senator Murray did a good job in trying to narrow the differences and actually pass a budget that I can sign.  It's not everything that I would like, obviously.  It buys back part of these across-the-board cuts, the so-called sequester, but not all of them.  So we're still underfunding research; we're still underfunding education; we're still underfunding transportation and other initiatives that would create jobs right now. But it was an honest conversation.  They operated in good faith.  And given how far apart the parties have been on fiscal issues, they should take pride in what they did.  And I actually called them after they struck the deal and I said congratulations, and I hope that creates a good pattern for next year, where we work on at least the things we agree to, even if we agree to disagree on some of the other big-ticket items. I think immigration potentially falls in that category, where let's -- here's an area where we've got bipartisan agreement.  There are a few differences here and there, but the truth of the matter is, is that the Senate bill has the main components of comprehensive immigration reform that would boost our economy, give us an opportunity to attract more investment and high-skilled workers who are doing great things in places like Silicon Valley and around the country.  So let's go ahead and get that done. Now, I can't imagine that having seen this possible daylight breaking when it comes to cooperation in Congress that folks are thinking actually about plunging us back into the kinds of brinksmanship and governance by crisis that has done us so much harm over the last couple of years. To repeat:  The debt ceiling is raised simply to pay bills that we have already accrued.  It is not something that is a negotiating tool.  It's not leverage.  It's the responsibility of Congress.  It's part of doing their job.  I expect them to do their job.  Although I'm happy to talk to them about any of the issues that they actually want to get done.  So if Congressman Ryan is interested in tax reform, let's go.  I've got some proposals on it.  If he's interested in any issue out there, I'm willing to have a constructive conversation of the sort that we just had in resolving the budget issues. But I've got to assume folks aren't crazy enough to start that thing all over again. Q:  If I may just quickly, on a more personal note, what is your New Year's resolution? President Obama:  My New Year's resolution is to be nicer to the White House Press Corps.  You know?  Absolutely. Q:  All right. President Obama:  Major Garrett. Q:  That's quite a lead-in, Mr. President, thank you.  Rick Leggett, who is the head of the NSA task force on Edward Snowden, told \"60 Minutes\" that it was, \"worth having a conversation about granting Edward Snowden amnesty.\"  To what degree, sir, were you pleased that he floated this trial balloon?  And under what circumstances would you consider either a plea agreement or amnesty for Edward Snowden?  And what do you say to Americans, sir, who after possibly being alerted to Judge Leon's decision earlier this week, reading the panel recommendations, do you believe Edward Snowden set in motion something that is proper and just in this country about the scope of surveillance and should not be considered by this government a criminal? President Obama:  I've got to be careful here, Major, because Mr. Snowden is under indictment, he's been charged with crimes. And that's the province of the Attorney General and, ultimately, a judge and a jury.  So I can't weigh in specifically on this case at this point.  I'll make -- I'll try to see if I can get at the spirit of the question, even if I can't talk about the specifics. I've said before and I believe that this is an important conversation that we needed to have.  I've also said before that the way in which these disclosures happened have been damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities. And I think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage. I'll give you just one specific example.  The fact of the matter is that the United States, for all our warts, is a country that abides by rule of law, that cares deeply about privacy, that cares about civil liberties, that cares about our Constitution.  And as a consequence of these disclosures, we've got countries who actually do the things that Mr. Snowden says he's worried about very explicitly -- engaging in surveillance of their own citizens, targeting political dissidents, targeting and suppressing the press -- who somehow are able to sit on the sidelines and act as if it's the United States that has problems when it comes to surveillance and intelligence operations.  And that's a pretty distorted view of what's going on out there. So I think that as important and as necessary as this debate has been, it is also important to keep in mind that this has done unnecessary damage to U.S. intelligence capabilities and U.S. diplomacy.  But I will leave it up to the courts and the Attorney General to weigh in publicly on the specifics of Mr. Snowden's case. Q:  Sir, if I could follow up, Mr. Leggett is setting this in motion, at least raising this as a topic of conversation.  You, sir, would I'm certain be consulted if there was ever going to be a conversation about amnesty or a plea bargain with Edward Snowden. President Obama:  I think that's true, Major, and I guess what I'm saying is there's a -- Q:  Would you rule it out forever that you would never consider it? President Obama:  What I'm saying is, is that there's a difference between Mr. Leggett saying something and President Obama of the United States saying something. Q:  That's why I'm trying to get at you. President Obama:  That's exactly right. Chuck Todd. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President, and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.  You talk about the issues with health care and the website rollout, but there have been other issues -- the misinformation about people keeping their policies, the extended deadlines, some postponements.  We have a new waiver that HHS announced last night.  How do you expect Americans to have confidence and certainty in this law if you keep changing it?  This one here, this new waiver last night, you could argue you might as well have just delayed the mandate. President Obama:  Well, no, that's not true, because what we're talking about is a very specific population that received cancellation notices from insurance companies.  The majority of them are either keeping their old plan because the grandfather clause has been extended further, or they're finding a better deal in the marketplace with better insurance for cheaper costs. But there may still be a subset -- a significantly smaller subset than some of the numbers that have been advertised -- that are still looking for options, are still concerned about what they're going to be doing next year.  And we just wanted to make sure that the hardship provision that was already existing in the law would also potentially apply to somebody who had problems during this transition period.  So that's the specifics of this latest change. You're making a broader point that I think is fair and that is that in a big project like this, that what we are constantly doing is looking, is this working the way it's supposed to, and if there are adjustments that can be made to smooth out the transition, we should make them.  But they don't go to the core of the law. First of all, the core of the law is, is that for 85 percent of the population, all they've been getting is free preventive care, better consumer protections, and ability to keep their kids on their insurance plan until they're 26, thousand-dollar or five hundred-dollar discounts on prescription drugs for seniors on Medicare.  So 85 percent of the population, whether they know it or not, over the last three years have benefited from a whole set of the provisions of the law.  And, by the way, if it were to be repealed, you would be taking away all those benefits from folks who already are enjoying them. You had this sub-portion of the population, 15 percent, who either don't have health insurance or are buying it on the individual market.  And that's still millions of people.  And what we're doing is creating a marketplace where they can buy insurance and we can provide them some tax credits to help them afford it. The basic structure of that law is working despite all the problems -- despite the website problems, despite the messaging problems.  Despite all that, it's working.  And again, you don't have to take my word for it.  We've got a couple million people who are going to have health insurance just in the first three months, despite the fact that probably the first month and a half was lost because of problems with the website and about as bad a bunch of publicity as you could imagine.  And yet you've still got 2 million people who signed up, or more. And so what that means then is that the demand is there and, as I said before, the product is good.  Now, in putting something like this together, there are going to be all kinds of problems that crop up, some of which may have been unanticipated.  And what we've been trying to do is just respond to them in a common-sense way.  And we're going to continue to try to do that.  But that doesn't negate the fact that a year from now or two years from now, when we look back, we're going to be able to say that even more people have health insurance who didn't have it before. And that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing.  That is part of the reason why I pushed so hard to get this law done in the first place. And I've said before this is a messy process, and I think sometimes when I say that people say, well, A, yes, it's real messy; and B, isn't the fact that it's been so messy some indication that there are more fundamental problems with the law? And I guess what I'd say to that, Chuck, is when you try to do something this big, affecting this many people, it's going to be hard.  And every instance -- whether it's Social Security, Medicare, the prescription drug plan under President Bush -- there hasn't been an instance where you tried to really have an impact on the American people's lives and wellbeing, particularly in the health care arena, where you don't end up having some of these challenges.  The question is going to be ultimately, do we make good decisions trying to help as many people as possible in as efficient a way as possible.  And I think that's what we're doing. Q:  But with 72 hours to go, you make this change where people are buying the junk -- frankly, a junk-type policy that you weren't -- you were trying to get people away from. President Obama:  Well, keep in mind, Chuck, first of all, that the majority of folks are going to have different options.  This is essentially a additional net in case folks might have slipped through the cracks.  We don't have precision on those numbers, but we expect it's going to be a relatively small number, because these are folks who want insurance and the vast majority of them have good options.  And in a state like North Carolina, for example, the overwhelming majority of them have just kept their own plans -- the ones that they had previously. But we thought and continue to think that it makes sense that as we are transitioning to a system in which insurance standards are higher, people don't have unpleasant surprises because they thought they had insurance until they hit a limit, and next thing you know they still owe $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000 for a hospital visit -- that as we transition to higher standards, better insurance, that we also address folks who get caught in that transition and there are unintended consequences. And I'll be -- that was the original intent of the grandfather clause that was in the law.  Obviously, the problem was it didn't catch enough people.  And we learned from that, and we're trying not to repeat those mistakes. Q:  So does the mandate need to be enforced? President Obama:  Absolutely.  Yes. Let's see, Phil Mattingly. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  What was the message you were trying to send with not only your decision not to attend the Sochi Games, but also with the people you named to the delegation to represent the United States at those games? President Obama:  Well, first of all, I haven't attended Olympics in the past, and I suspect that me attending the Olympics, particularly at a time when we've got all the other stuff that people have been talking about, is going to be tough, although I would love to do it.  I'll be going to a lot of Olympic Games post-presidency.  I think the delegation speaks for itself.  You've got outstanding Americans, outstanding athletes, people who will represent us extraordinarily well. And the fact that we've got folks like Billie Jean King or Brian Boitano, who themselves have been world-class athletes that everybody acknowledges for their excellence but also for their character, who also happen to be members of the LGBT community, you should take that for what it's worth -- that when it comes to the Olympics and athletic performance, we don't make distinctions on the basis of sexual orientation.  We judge people on how they perform, both on the court and off the court -- on the field and off the field.  And that's a value that I think is at the heart of not just America, but American sports. I'm going to just roll down these last few, real quickly.  Ari Shapiro.  Last day at the White House.  He deserves a question. Q:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  Senator Max Baucus was widely seen as the best hope for a large-scale deal to overhaul the tax code.  What does your decision to nominate him as ambassador to China say about your hopes for major tax bill in your second term? President Obama:  It says that Max Baucus is going to be an outstanding ambassador to China, and I'd like a swift confirmation.  And my expectation and hope is, is that if both the Senate Democrats -- or if Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate are serious about tax reform, then it's not going to depend on one guy, it's going to depend on all of us working together.  And my office is ready, willing, and eager to engage both parties and having a conversation about how we can simplify the tax code, make it fairer, make it work to create more jobs and do right by middle-class Americans. Jackie Calmes. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  And how do you say it in Hawaii?  Mele Kalikimaka? President Obama:  Mele Kalikimaka. Q:  Since we've been looking back at the year, I'd like to ask you what your reaction was to the nonpartisan truth-telling group, PolitiFact, when it said that the lie of the year was your statement that if you like your health care plan, you can keep it. And related to the health care problems that we've seen over the past year, the fallout from that seems to be making Democrats, particularly in the Senate, a little rambunctious and independent of you, which is evidenced most clearly in the debate over the Iran sanctions.  It looks like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has expedited consideration of an Iran sanctions bill for January, even as your Administration -- and you have been trying to get them to lay off sanctions while your -- President Obama:  Jackie, I've got to say, you're stringing a bunch of things along here.  Let's see if we can hone in on a question.  I mean, I -- Q:  Two questions.  That's a lot less than Ed Henry had. Q:  Oh!  I thought we were trying to get along for Christmas. President Obama:  How about I separate out the Iran question from the health care question?  On the health care question, look, I think I've answered several times -- this is a new iteration of it -- but bottom line is that we are going to continue to work every single day to make sure that implementation of the health care law and the website and all elements of it, including the grandfather clause, work better every single day.  And as I've said in previous press conferences, we're going to make mistakes, and we're going to have problems, but my intentions have been clear throughout, which is, I just want to help as many people as possible feel secure and make sure that they don't go broke when they get sick. And we're going to just keep on doing that. On Iran, there is the possibility of a resolution to a problem that has been a challenge for American national security for over a decade now, and that is getting Iran to, in a verifiable fashion, not pursue a nuclear weapon.  Already, even with the interim deal that we struck in Geneva, we had the first halt and, in some cases, some rollback of Iran's nuclear capabilities -- the first time that we've seen that in almost a decade.  And we now have a structure in which we can have a very serious conversation to see is it possible for Iran to get right with the international community in a verifiable fashion to give us all confidence that any peaceful nuclear program that they have is not going to be weaponized in a way that threatens us or allies in the region, including Israel. And as I've said before and I will repeat, it is very important for us to test whether that's possible, not because it's guaranteed, but because the alternative is possibly us having to engage in some sort of conflict to resolve the problem with all kinds of unintended consequences. Now, I've been very clear from the start, I mean what I say: It is my goal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. But I sure would rather do it diplomatically.  I'm keeping all options on the table, but if I can do it diplomatically, that's how we should do it.  And I would think that would be the preference of everybody up on Capitol Hill because that sure is the preference of the American people. And we lose nothing during this negotiation period.   Precisely because there are verification provisions in place, we will have more insight into Iran's nuclear program over the next six months than we have previously.  We'll know if they are violating the terms of the agreement.  They're not allowed to accelerate their stockpile of enriched uranium -- in fact, they have to reduce their stockpile of highly enriched uranium. Ironically, if we did not have this six-month period in which we're testing whether we can get a comprehensive solution to this problem, they'd be advancing even further on their nuclear program.  And in light of all that, what I've said to members of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans -- is there is no need for new sanctions legislation.  Not yet. Now, if Iran comes back and says, we can't give you assurances that we're not going to weaponize, if they're not willing to address some of their capabilities that we know could end up resulting in them having breakout capacity, it's not going to be hard for us to turn the dials back, strengthen sanctions even further.  I'll work with members of Congress to put even more pressure on Iran.  But there's no reason to do it right now.  And so I'm not surprised that there's been some talk from some members of Congress about new sanctions -- I think the politics of trying to look tough on Iran are often good when you're running for office or if you're in office.  But as President of the United States right now, who's been responsible over the last four years, with the help of Congress, in putting together a comprehensive sanctions regime that was specifically designed to put pressure on them and bring them to the table to negotiate -- what I'm saying to them, what I've said to the international community, and what I've said to the American people is let's test it.  Now is the time to try to see if we can get this thing done. And I've heard some logic that says, well, Mr. President, we're supportive of the negotiations, but we think it's really useful to have this club hanging over Iran's head.  Well, first of all, we still have the existing sanctions already in place that are resulting in Iran losing billions of dollars every month in lost oil sales.  We already have banking and financial sanctions that are still being applied even as the negotiations are taking place.  It's not as if we're letting up on that. I've heard arguments, well, but this way we can be assured and the Iranians will know that if negotiations fail even new and harsher sanctions will be put into place.  Listen, I don't think the Iranians have any doubt that Congress would be more than happy to pass more sanctions legislation.  We can do that in a day, on a dime.  But if we're serious about negotiations, we've got to create an atmosphere in which Iran is willing to move in ways that are uncomfortable for them and contrary to their ideology and rhetoric and their instincts and their suspicions of us.  And we don't help get them to a position where we can actually resolve this by engaging in this kind of action. Okay, everybody, I think I'm going to take one more question.  Colleen McCain Nelson.  And that is it. Q: Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama:  There you are. Q:   Some of your longtime advisors are leaving the White House and new folks are coming in.  Others are taking on new roles in the West Wing.  As you reshape your team a bit, how does that change the dynamic here and how does it impact what you think you can accomplish going forward? President Obama:  I just had lunch with Pete Rouse, who is leaving me.  And that's tough. Q:  He says so. President Obama:  He says so right now at least.  I love that guy and that will be a significant loss, although he'll still be in town and, hopefully, I'll be able to consult with him on an ongoing basis. I think the fact that John Podesta is coming in will be terrific.  He may deny it, but I've been trying to get him in here for quite some time.  He ran my transition office.  I asked him when he was running the transition office if he would be willing to join us, and at that time I think he was still feeling that he wanted to develop CAP and other organizations.  But John is a great strategist, as good as anybody on domestic policy.  And I think he'll be a huge boost to us and give us more bandwidth to deal with more issues. I suspect that we may have additional announcements in the New Year.  There's a natural turnover that takes place.  People get tired.  People get worn out.  Sometimes, you need fresh legs. But what I can tell you is that the team I have now is tireless and shares my values, and believes the thing that I think I've repeated probably four or five times in this press conference, which is we get this incredible privilege for a pretty short period of time to do as much as we can for as many people as we can to help them live better lives.  And that's what drives them.  That's the sacrifice they make being away from families and soccer games and birthdays, and some of them will end up working over Christmas on issues like Iran.  And the fact that they make those kinds of sacrifices I'm always grateful for. And if they then say to me after making those sacrifices for three, four, five years, I need a break, then I completely understand. All right?", "filename": "20December2013EndofYearPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "The walls of the city were too steep for any one person to climb. They were too strong to be taken down by brute force. And so, the people sat for days, unable to pass on through; but God had a plan for His People. He told them to stand together and march together around the city, and on the seventh day he told them that when they heard the sound of the rams horn, they should speak with one voice. And, at the chosen hour when the horn sounded and a chorus of voices cried out together, the mighty walls of Jericho came tumbling down. Thats what scripture tells us. And there are many lessons to take from this passage, just as there are many lessons to take from this day, just as there are many memories that fill the space of this church. As I was thinking about which ones we needed to remember at this hour, my mind went back to the very beginning of the modern Civil Rights era. Because before Memphis and the mountaintop, before the bridge in Selma and the march on Washington, before Birmingham and the beatings, the fire hoses, and the loss of those four little girls, before there was King the icon and his magnificent dream, there was King the young preacher and a people who found themselves suffering under the yolk of oppression. And on the eve of the bus boycotts in Montgomery, at a time when many were still doubtful about the possibilities of change, a time when there were those in the black community who not only mistrusted each other, but mistrusted themselves -- King inspired with words not of anger, but of an urgency, a fierce urgency that still speaks to us today. Unity, he said, is the great need of the hour. Unity is the great need of the hour. Unity is how we shall overcome. What Dr. King understood is that if just one person chose to walk instead of ri[de] the bus, those walls of oppression would not be moved. But maybe if a few more decided to walk, those foundations might start to shake. If just a few women were willing to do what Rosa Parks had been willing to do, maybe the cracks in those walls would start to show. If teenagers took rides from North to South, maybe a few bricks would come loose. Maybe if white folks marched because theyd come to understand that their freedom was wrapped up in the freedom of others, that they too had a stake in the impending battle, the walls would begin to sway, and if enough Americans were awakened to injustice, if they joined together North and South, rich and poor, Jew and Gentile, then perhaps that wall would come tumbling down, and justice would flow like waters of righteousness, like a mighty stream. Unity is the great need of the hour. Thats what Dr. King said. It is the great need of this hour as well, not because it sounds pleasant, not because it makes us feel good, but because it's the only way we can overcome the essential deficit that exits in this country. Im not talking about the budget deficit. Im not talking about the trade deficit. Talking about the moral deficit in this country. Im talking about an empathy deficit, the inability to recognize ourselves in one another, to understand that we are our brothers keeper and our sisters keeper, that in the words of Dr. King, We are all tied together in a single garment of destiny. We have an empathy deficit when were still sending our children down corridors of shame, schools in the forgotten corners of America where the color of your skin still affects the content of your education. We have a deficit when CEOs are making more in ten minutes than ordinary workers are making in an entire year, when families lose their homes so unscrupulous lenders can make a profit, when mothers cant afford a doctor when their children are stricken with illness. We have a deficit in this country when we have Scooter Libby justice for some and Jena justice for others, when our children see hanging nooses from a school yard tree today, in the present, in the 21st century. We have a deficit when homeless veterans sleep on the streets of our cities, when innocents are slaughtered in the deserts of Darfur, when young Americans serve tour after tour after tour after tour of duty in a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged. We have an empathy deficit in this country that has to be closed. We have a deficit when it takes a breach in the levees to reveal the breach in our compassion, when it takes a terrible storm to reveal the hungry that God calls on us to feed, the sick that He calls on us to care for, the least of these that He commands that we treat as our own. So, we have a deficit to close. We have walls, barriers to justice and equality that must come down, and to do this, we know that unity is the great need of the hour. However, all too often, when we talk about unity in this country, weve come to believe that it can be purchased on the cheap. Weve come to believe that racial reconciliation can come easily; that its just a matter of a few ignorant people trapped in the prejudices of the past, and that if the demagogues and those who would exploit our racial divisions will simply go away then all our problems will be solved. All too often, we seek to ignore the profound structural and institutional barriers that stand in the way of insuring opportunity for all of our children, or decent jobs for all of our people, or health care for those who are sick. We offer unity, but we are not willing to pay the price that's required  Of course, true unity cannot be so easily purchased. It starts with a change in attitudes. It starts with changing our hearts, and changing our minds, broadening our spirit. Its not easy to stand in somebody elses shoes. Its not easy to see past our own differences. Weve all encountered this in our own lives. What makes it even more difficult is that we have a politics in this country that seeks to drive us apart, that puts up walls between us. We are told that those who differ from us on a few things, differ from us on all things, that our problems are the fault of those who dont think like us or look like us or come from where we do. The Welfare Queen, shes taking our money. The Immigrant, hes taking our jobs. The believer condemns the nonbeliever as immoral, and the nonbeliever chides the believer for being intolerant. And for most of this countrys history, we in the African-American community have been at the receiving end of mans inhumanity to man. And all of us understand insidious -- All of us understand intimately the insidious role that race still sometimes plays on the job and in the schools, in our health care system, and in our criminal justice system. And yet, if we are honest with ourselves, we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean. If were honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to Kings vision of a beloved community. If were honest with ourselves, we have to admit that there have been times when we've scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them. The scourge of anti-Semitism has at times revealed itself in our community. For too long, some of us have seen immigrants only as competitors for jobs instead of companions in the fight for opportunity. Everyday our politics fuels and exploits this kind of division across all races and regions, across gender and party. It is played out on television; it is sensationalized by the media. Last week, it crept into the campaign for President with charges and countercharges that serve to obscure the issues instead of illuminating the critical choices we face as a nation. None of our hands are clean. So let us say that on this day of all days, each of us carries with us the task of changing our hearts and minds. The divisions, the stereotypes, the scapegoating, the ease with which we blame the plight of ourselves on others -- all of that distracts us from the common challenges that we face, war and poverty, inequality and injustice. We can no longer afford to build ourselves up by tearing each other down. We can no longer afford to traffic in lies or fear or hate. It's the poison that we must purge from our politics, the wall that we must tear down before the hour grows too late. Because if Dr. King could love his jailer, if he could call on the faithful, who once sat where you do, to forgive those who had set dogs and fire hoses upon them, then surely we can look past what divides us in our time and bind up our wounds and erase the sympathy deficit that exists in our hearts. But if changing our hearts and our minds is the first critical step, we cannot stop there. Its not enough to bemoan the plight of the poor in this country and remain unwilling to push our elected officials to provide the resources to fix our schools. It's not enough to decry the disparities of health care and yet allow the insurance companies and the drug companies to block real reform in our health care system. Its not enough -- Its not enough for us to abhor the costs of a misguided war, and yet we continue to allow ourselves to be driven by a politics of fear that sees the threat of an attack as a way to scare up votes instead of a call to come together in a common effort. Scripture tells us that we are judged not just by word but by deed. And if we are truly to bring about the unity that is needed, that is so crucial in this time, we have to find it within ourselves to act on what we know, to understand that living up to this countrys ideals and its possibilities is going to require great effort and great resources, sacrifice and stamina. We cant pass a law called No Child Left Behind and then leave the money behind. That is not a serious effort in bringing about the unity that is needed. We cant celebrate Dr. Kings dream, and yet still have insufficient funds to cash that promissory note that was promised at the beginning of this nation. That is what is at stake in this great debate we are having today. Changes that are needed are not just a matter of tinkering around the edges. They will not come if politicians simply tell us what we want to hear. All of us will be called upon to make some sacrifice. None of us will be exempt from responsibility. We've had to fight to fix our schools, but we also have to challenge ourselves to be better parents, and turn off the television set, and put away the video game, and our men have to be home with our children. That, too, is part of the challenge that we must make. We will have to confront the biases in our criminal justice system, but we also have to acknowledge the deep-seeded violence that still resides in our own communities, in too many of the hearts of our young people, and we have to break the grip of that violence wherever we see it. Thats how were going to bring about the change that we seek. Thats how Dr. King led this country through the wilderness. He did it with words, words that he spoke not just to the children of slaves but the children of slave owners, words that inspired not just black but also white, not just Christian but also Jew and Muslim and Buddhists and Atheists, not just the southerner but also the northerner. He led with words, but he also led with deeds. He also led by example. He led by marching and going to jail and suffering threats and beatings and being away from his family. He led by taking a stand against a war knowing full well that it would diminish his popularity. He led by challenging our economic structures, understanding that it would cause discomfort. Dr. King understood that unity cannot be won on the cheap, that we would have to earn it through great effort and determination. Thats the unity, the hard earned unity that we need right now. That is the effort, the determination that can transform blind optimism into hope. You know people have remarked on the fact that I talk about hope a lot in my campaign. You know they -- they tease me a little bit. Some have been scornful. They say, Ah, hes talking about hope again. Hes so idealistic. Hes so nave. Hes a hope monger. Thats okay. Its true. I talk about hope. I talk about it a lot because the odds of me standing here today are so small, so remote that I couldnt of gotten here without some hope. You know my -- my daddy left me when I was two years old. I needed some hope to get here. I was raised by a single mother. I needed some hope to get here. I got in trouble when I was a teenager, did some things folks now like to talk about. I needed some hope to get here. I wasnt born into money, or great wealth, or great privilege, or status. I was given love, an education, and some hope. Thats what I got. Thats my birthright. So I talk about hope. I -- I put Hope on my campaign signs. It doesnt even have my name on them sometimes -- just says Hope. Folks dont know who theyre voting for, but it makes them feel good. Say, you know, huh?", "filename": "20January2008EbenezerBaptistChurchSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are 15 years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many. But tonight, we turn the page.  Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before.  More of our people are insured than ever before.  And we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as weve been in almost 30 years. Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service. America, for all that we have endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong. At this moment -- with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  Its now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come. Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort? Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet? Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another?  Or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward? In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, Ill crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.  So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us. It begins with our economy.  Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.  They were young and in love in America.  And it doesnt get much better than that.  If only we had known, Rebekah wrote to me last spring, what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.  As the crisis worsened, Bens business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction -- and home for dinner every night. It is amazing, Rebekah wrote, what you can bounce back from when you have towe are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.  We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times. America, Rebekah and Bens story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard and scrimped, and sacrificed and retooled.  You are the reason that I ran for this office.  You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger. We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.    We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump.    We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  More Americans finish college than ever before.    We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.    At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, weve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.  This is good news, people. So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work as long as politics dont get in the way.  We cant slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We cant put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when weve got to fix a broken system.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it.  It will have earned my veto.    Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees pay than at any time since 2007.  But heres the thing:  Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesnt screw things up; that government doesnt halt the progress were making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, lets do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.    Because families like Rebekahs still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but theyve had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Friday night pizza, thats a big splurge.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isnt asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead. And in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet -- tools they needed to go as far as their effort and their dreams will take them. Thats what middle-class economics is -- the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules.  We dont just want everyone to share in Americas success, we want everyone to contribute to our success.  So what does middle-class economics require in our time?  First, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement.  And my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.  Heres one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority -- so this country provided universal childcare.  In todays economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.  Its not a nice-to-have -- its a must-have.  So its time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or as a womens issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  And thats why my plan will make quality childcare more available and more affordable for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America -- by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.  Heres another example.  Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesnt guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave -- 43 million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So Ill be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.  And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, lets put it to a vote right here in Washington.  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  Its the right thing to do.  Its the right thing to do.  Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  Thats why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  Its 2015.  Its time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime theyve earned.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.  Now, these ideas wont make everybody rich, wont relieve every hardship.  Thats not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarters earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their companys long-term interest.  We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.  But you know, things like childcare and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage -- these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  Thats a fact.  And thats what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do. Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.  America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, trained the best workforce in the world.  We were ahead of the curve.  But other countries caught on.  And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game.  We need to do more. By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education -- two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  Its not fair to them, and its sure not smart for our future.  Thats why Im sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college -- to zero.    Keep in mind 40 percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy without a load of debt.  Understand, youve got to earn it.  Youve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.  Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  Lets stay ahead of the curve.  And I want to work with this Congress to make sure those already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesnt derail anyones dreams.    Thanks to Vice President Bidens great work to update our job training system, were connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, Im also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships -- opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they dont have a higher education. And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, weve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  Were slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need.  And were making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.  And Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden -- thank you, Michelle; thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job.  So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody whos going to get the job done and done right, hire a veteran.  Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.  Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.  Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didnt even exist 10 or 20 years ago -- jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.  So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  We know that.  And thats why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire. Twenty-first century businesses need 21st century infrastructure -- modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So lets set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Lets pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.  Lets do it.  Lets get it done.  Lets get it done.  Twenty-first century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.  But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the worlds fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen?", "filename": "20January2015SixthPresidentialStateoftheUnionSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "I know that there are a lot of people here who have been so engaged in the campaign, have sacrificed so much, people who've been involved back since 2007. And...so I...want all of you to know how appreciative I am.  And I know many of you came here today for a campaign event. I was looking forward to having a fun conversation with you about some really important matters that we face as a country and the differences between myself and my opponent in this election. But this morning, we woke up to news of a tragedy that reminds us of all the ways that we are united as one American family. By now, many of you know, many of you have heard that a few miles outside of Denver, in a town call Aurora, at least 12 people were killed when a gunman opened fire in a movie theater, and dozens more are being treated for injuries at a local hospital. Some of the victims are being treated at a childrens hospital.  Now, were still gathering all the facts about what happened in Aurora, but what we do know is that the police have one suspect in custody. And the federal government stands ready to do whatever is necessary to bring whoever is responsible for this heinous crime to justice -- and we will take every step possible to ensure the safety of all of our people.  We're going to stand by our neighbors in Colorado during this extraordinarily difficult time. And I had a chance to speak with the Mayor of Aurora as well as the Governor of Colorado to express, not just on behalf of Michelle and myself, but the entire American family, how heartbroken we are. Now, even as we learn how this happened and who's responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this. Such violence, such evil is senseless. It's beyond reason. But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living. The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved. They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sons and daughters, friends and neighbors. They had hopes for the future and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled.  And if theres anything to take away from this tragedy its the reminder that life is very fragile. Our time here is limited and it is precious. And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things; its not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives. Ultimately, its how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another. Its -- It's what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose. Thats what matters. At the end of the day, what well remember will be those we loved and what we did for others. Thats why were here. Im sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when I heard this news. My daughters go to the movies. What if Malia and Sasha had been at the theater, as so many of our kids do every day?", "filename": "20July2012RemarksontheTragedyinAuroraColorado.txt"}, {"question": "For more than 200 years, our tradition of welcoming immigrants from around the world has given us a tremendous advantage over other nations. Its kept us youthful, dynamic, and entrepreneurial. It has shaped our character as a people with limitless possibilities -- people not trapped by our past, but able to remake ourselves as we choose. But today, our immigration system is broken -- and everybody knows it. Families who enter our country the right way and play by the rules watch others flout the rules. Business owners who offer their workers good wages and benefits see the competition exploit undocumented immigrants by paying them far less. All of us take offense to anyone who reaps the rewards of living in America without taking on the responsibilities of living in America. And undocumented immigrants who desperately want to embrace those responsibilities see little option but to remain in the shadows, or risk their families being torn apart. Its been this way for decades. And for decades, we havent done much about it. When I took office, I committed to fixing this broken immigration system. And I began by doing what I could to secure our borders. Today, we have more agents and technology deployed to secure our southern border than at any time in our history. And over the past six years, illegal border crossings have been cut by more than half. Although this summer, there was a brief spike in unaccompanied children being apprehended at our border, the number of such children is now actually lower than its been in nearly two years. Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s. Those are the facts. Meanwhile, I worked with Congress on a comprehensive fix, and last year, 68 Democrats, Republicans, and independents came together to pass a bipartisan bill in the Senate. It wasnt perfect. It was a compromise. But it reflected common sense. It would have doubled the number of border patrol agents while giving undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship if they paid a fine, started paying their taxes, and went to the back of the line. And independent experts said that it would help grow our economy and shrink our deficits. Had the House of Representatives allowed that kind of bill a simple yes-or-no vote, it would have passed with support from both parties, and today it would be the law. But for a year and a half now, Republican leaders in the House have refused to allow that simple vote. Now, I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law. But until that happens, there are actions I have the legal authority to take as President -- the same kinds of actions taken by Democratic and Republican presidents before me -- that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just. Tonight, I am announcing those actions. First, well build on our progress at the border with additional resources for our law enforcement personnel so that they can stem the flow of illegal crossings, and speed the return of those who do cross over. Second, Ill make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed. Third, well take steps to deal responsibly with the millions of undocumented immigrants who already live in our country. I want to say more about this third issue, because it generates the most passion and controversy. Even as we are a nation of immigrants, were also a nation of laws. Undocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable -- especially those who may be dangerous. Thats why, over the past six years, deportations of criminals are up 80 percent. And thats why were going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families. Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom whos working hard to provide for her kids. Well prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day. But even as we focus on deporting criminals, the fact is, millions of immigrants in every state, of every race and nationality still live here illegally. And lets be honest -- tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isnt realistic. Anyone who suggests otherwise isnt being straight with you. Its also not who we are as Americans. After all, most of these immigrants have been here a long time. They work hard, often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families. They worship at our churches. Many of their kids are American-born or spent most of their lives here, and their hopes, dreams, and patriotism are just like ours. As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it: They are a part of American life. Now heres the thing: We expect people who live in this country to play by the rules. We expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded. So were going to offer the following deal: If youve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and youre willing to pay your fair share of taxes -- youll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily without fear of deportation. You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. Thats what this deal is. Now, lets be clear about what it isnt. This deal does not apply to anyone who has come to this country recently. It does not apply to anyone who might come to America illegally in the future. It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive -- only Congress can do that. All were saying is were not going to deport you. I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty. Well, its not. Amnesty is the immigration system we have today -- millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time. Thats the real amnesty -- leaving this broken system the way it is. Mass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportation would be both impossible and contrary to our character. What Im describing is accountability -- a common-sense, middle-ground approach: If you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If youre a criminal, youll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up. The actions Im taking are not only lawful, theyre the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century. And to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: Pass a bill. I want to work with both parties to pass a more permanent legislative solution. And the day I sign that bill into law, the actions I take will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile, dont let a disagreement over a single issue be a dealbreaker on every issue. Thats not how our democracy works, and Congress certainly shouldnt shut down our government again just because we disagree on this. Americans are tired of gridlock. What our country needs from us right now is a common purpose -- a higher purpose. Most Americans support the types of reforms Ive talked about tonight. But I understand the disagreements held by many of you at home. Millions of us, myself included, go back generations in this country, with ancestors who put in the painstaking work to become citizens. So we dont like the notion that anyone might get a free pass to American citizenship. I know some worry immigration will change the very fabric of who we are, or take our jobs, or stick it to middle-class families at a time when they already feel like theyve gotten the raw deal for over a decade. I hear these concerns. But thats not what these steps would do. Our history and the facts show that immigrants are a net plus for our economy and our society. And I believe its important that all of us have this debate without impugning each others character. Because for all the back and forth of Washington, we have to remember that this debate is about something bigger. Its about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations. Are we a nation that tolerates the hypocrisy of a system where workers who pick our fruit and make our beds never have a chance to get right with the law? Or are we a nation that gives them a chance to make amends, take responsibility, and give their kids a better future? Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works together to keep them together? Are we a nation that educates the worlds best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs here, create businesses here, create industries right here in America? Thats what this debate is all about. We need more than politics as usual when it comes to immigration. We need reasoned, thoughtful, compassionate debate that focuses on our hopes, not our fears. I know the politics of this issue are tough. But let me tell you why I have come to feel so strongly about it. Over the past few years, I have seen the determination of immigrant fathers who worked two or three jobs without taking a dime from the government, and at risk any moment of losing it all, just to build a better life for their kids. Ive seen the heartbreak and anxiety of children whose mothers might be taken away from them just because they didnt have the right papers. Ive seen the courage of students who, except for the circumstances of their birth, are as American as Malia or Sasha; students who bravely come out as undocumented in hopes they could make a difference in the country they love. These people -- our neighbors, our classmates, our friends -- they did not come here in search of a free ride or an easy life. They came to work, and study, and serve in our military, and above all, contribute to Americas success. Tomorrow, Ill travel to Las Vegas and meet with some of these students, including a young woman named Astrid Silva. Astrid was brought to America when she was four years old. Her only possessions were a cross, her doll, and the frilly dress she had on. When she started school, she didnt speak any English. She caught up to other kids by reading newspapers and watching PBS, and she became a good student. Her father worked in landscaping. Her mom cleaned other peoples homes. They wouldnt let Astrid apply to a technology magnet school, not because they didnt love her, but because they were afraid the paperwork would out her as an undocumented immigrant -- so she applied behind their back and got in. Still, she mostly lived in the shadows -- until her grandmother, who visited every year from Mexico, passed away, and she couldnt travel to the funeral without risk of being found out and deported. It was around that time she decided to begin advocating for herself and others like her, and today, Astrid Silva is a college student working on her third degree. Are we a nation that kicks out a striving, hopeful immigrant like Astrid, or are we a nation that finds a way to welcome her in?", "filename": "20November2014NationalImmigrationPolicyAddress.txt"}, {"question": "And I want to thank President Jalil for his remarks and for all that he and Prime Minister Jibril have done to help Libya reach this moment. To all the heads of state, to all the countries represented here who have done so much over the past several months to ensure this day could come, I want to say thank you, as well. Today, the Libyan people are writing a new chapter in the life of their nation. After four decades of darkness, they can walk the streets, free from a tyrant. They are making their voices heard -- in new newspapers, and on radio and television, in public squares and on personal blogs. Theyre launching political parties and civil groups to shape their own destiny and secure their universal rights. And here at the United Nations, the new flag of a free Libya now flies among the community of nations. Today, the Libyan people are writing a new chapter in the life of their nation. After four decades of darkness, they can walk the streets, free from a tyrant. They are making their voices heard -- in new newspapers, and on radio and television, in public squares and on personal blogs. Theyre launching political parties and civil groups to shape their own destiny and secure their universal rights. And here at the United Nations, the new flag of a free Libya now flies among the community of nations. Make no mistake -- credit for the liberation of Libya belongs to the people of Libya. It was Libyan men and women -- and children -- who took to the streets in peaceful protest, who faced down the tanks and endured the snipers bullets. It was Libyan fighters, often outgunned and outnumbered, who fought pitched battles, town-by-town, block-by-block. It was Libyan activists -- in the underground, in chat rooms, in mosques -- who kept a revolution alive, even after some of the world had given up hope. It was Libyan women and girls who hung flags and smuggled weapons to the front. It was Libyans from countries around the world, including my own, who rushed home to help, even though they, too, risked brutality and death. It was Libyan blood that was spilled and Libyas sons and daughters who gave their lives. And on that August day -- after all that sacrifice, after 42 long years -- it was Libyans who pushed their dictator from power. At the same time, Libya is a lesson in what the international community can achieve when we stand together as one. I said at the beginning of this process, we cannot and should not intervene every time there is an injustice in the world. Yet its also true that there are times where the world could have and should have summoned the will to prevent the killing of innocents on a horrific scale. And we are forever haunted by the atrocities that we did not prevent, and the lives that we did not save. But this time was different. This time, we, through the United Nations, found the courage and the collective will to act. When the old regime unleashed a campaign of terror, threatening to roll back the democratic tide sweeping the region, we acted as united nations, and we acted swiftly -- broadening sanctions, imposing an arms embargo. The United States led the effort to pass a historic resolution at the Security Council authorizing \"all necessary measures\" to protect the Libyan people. And when the civilians of Benghazi were threatened with a massacre, we exercised that authority. Our international coalition stopped the regime in its tracks, and saved countless lives, and gave the Libyan people the time and the space to prevail. Important, too, is how this effort succeeded -- thanks to the leadership and contributions of many countries. The United States was proud to play a decisive role, especially in the early days, and then in a supporting capacity. But lets remember that it was the Arab League that appealed for action. It was the worlds most effective alliance, NATO, thats led a military coalition of nearly 20 nations. Its our European allies -- especially the United Kingdom and France and Denmark and Norway -- that conducted the vast majority of air strikes protecting rebels on the ground. It was Arab states who joined the coalition, as equal partners. And its been the United Nations and neighboring countries -- including Tunisia and Egypt -- that have cared for the Libyans in the urgent humanitarian effort that continues today. This is how the international community should work in the 21st century -- more nations bearing the responsibility and the costs of meeting global challenges. In fact, this is the very purpose of this United Nations. So every nation represented here today can take pride in the innocent lives we saved and in helping Libyans reclaim their country. It was the right thing to do. Now, even as we speak, remnants of the old regime continue to fight. Difficult days are still ahead. But one thing is clear -- the future of Libya is now in the hands of the Libyan people. For just as it was Libyans who tore down the old order, it will be Libyans who build their new nation. And weve come here today to say to the people of Libya -- just as the world stood by you in your struggle to be free, we will now stand with you in your struggle to realize the peace and prosperity that freedom can bring. In this effort, you will have a friend and partner in the United States of America. Today, I can announce that our ambassador is on his way back to Tripoli. And this week, the American flag that was lowered before our embassy was attacked will be raised again, over a re-opened American embassy. We will work closely with the new U.N. Support Mission in Libya and with the nations here today to assist the Libyan people in the hard work ahead. First, and most immediately: security. So long as the Libyan people are being threatened, the NATO-led mission to protect them will continue. And those still holding out must understand -- the old regime is over, and it is time to lay down your arms and join the new Libya. As this happens, the world must also support efforts to secure dangerous weapons -- conventional and otherwise -- and bring fighters under central, civilian control. For without security, democracy and trade and investment cannot flourish. Second: the humanitarian effort. The Transitional National Council has been working quickly to restore water and electricity and food supplies to Tripoli. But for many Libyans, each day is still a struggle -- to recover from their wounds, reunite with their families, and return to their homes. And even after the guns of war fall silent, the ravages of war will continue. So our efforts to assist its victims must continue. In this, the United States -- the United Nations will play a key role. And along with our partners, the United States will do our part to help the hungry and the wounded. Third: a democratic transition that is peaceful, inclusive and just. President Jalil has just reaffirmed the Transitional National Councils commitment to these principles, and the United Nations will play a central role in coordinating international support for this effort. We all know what is needed -- a transition that is timely, new laws and a constitution that uphold the rule of law, political parties and a strong civil society, and, for the first time in Libyan history, free and fair elections. True democracy, however, must flow from its citizens. So as Libyans rightly seek justice for past crimes, let it be done in a spirit of reconciliation, and not reprisals and violence. As Libyans draw strength from their faith -- a religion rooted in peace and tolerance -- let there be a rejection of violent extremism, which offers nothing but death and destruction. As Libyans rebuild, let those efforts tap the experience of all those with the skills to contribute, including the many Africans in Libya. And as Libyans forge a society that is truly just, let it enshrine the rights and role of women at all levels of society. For we know that the nations that uphold the human rights of all people, especially their women, are ultimately more successful and more prosperous. Which brings me to the final area where the world must stand with Libya, and that is restoring prosperity. For too long, Libyas vast riches were stolen and squandered. Now that wealth must serve its rightful owners -- the Libyan people. As sanctions are lifted, as the United States and the international community unfreeze more Libyan assets, and as the country's oil production is restored, the Libyan people deserve a government that is transparent and accountable. And bound by the Libyan students and entrepreneurs who have forged friendships in the United States, we intend to build new partnerships to help unleash Libyas extraordinary potential. Now, none of this will be easy. After decades of iron rule by one man, it will take time to build the institutions needed for a democratic Libya. Im sure there will be days of frustration; there will be days when progress is slow; there will be days when some begin to wish for the old order and its illusion of stability.

Israel is not going anywhere -- but especially for the young people in this audience, the question is what does its future hold?", "filename": "21March2013JerusalemInternationalConventionCenterSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "President Barack Obama, we are pleased to welcome you on this, the first visit of a President of the United States of America to our country in 88 years. We have observed that in the 15 months that have passed since the decision was made to establish our diplomatic relations, we have obtained concrete results. We were able to resume direct postal exchanges and we signed an agreement to resume commercial flights. We have signed two memorandums of understanding on the protection of the environment and maritime areas, and another one to secure the safety of sea navigation. Today, another one will be signed on cooperation of the area of agriculture. At the moment, another set of bilateral instruments are being negotiated to cooperate in such areas as counter narcotics, the safety of commerce, and travelers and health. About this last issue, we have agreed to deepen our cooperation in the prevention and treatment of transmissible diseases, such as Zika, and non-transmissible chronic diseases, cancer included. This cooperation is beneficial not only for Cuba and the United States, but also for our hemisphere at large. Following the decisions made by President Obama to modify the application of some aspects of the blockade, Cuban enterprises and their American counterparts are working to identify possible commercial operations that could materialize in the still restrictive framework of existing regulations. The fact is that some have already materialized, especially in the area of telecommunications -- an area in which our country already has a program designed on the basis of its priorities and the necessary technological sovereignty, one that can secure the appropriate (ph) views and the service of national interests. Progress has also been made toward the acquisition of medicines, medical materiel and equipment for power generation and environmental protection, these among others. Much more could be done if the blockade were lifted. We recognize the position of President Obama and his Administration against the blockade, and his repeated appeals to Congress to have it removed. The most recent measures adopted by his Administration are positive but insufficient. I had the opportunity to discuss with the President other steps that we think could be taken in order to remove restrictions that remain in force, and make a significant contribution to the debunking of the blockade. This is essential, because the blockade remains in force and because it contains discouraging elements and intimidating effects and extra- territorial outreach. I put forward to the President some examples on this, showing their negative consequences for both Cuba and other countries. The blockade stands as the most important obstacle to our economic development and the wellbeing of the Cuba people. That's why its removal will be of the essence to normalize bilateral relations. And actually, it will also bring benefits to the Cuban emigrants who wish the best for their families and their country. In order to move forward towards normalization, it will also be necessary to return the territory illegally occupied by Guantanamo Naval Base. Since they stand as the two main obstacles, these issues were again dealt with in the editorial ran on March 9 by the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba. And again, only four days ago, in the press conference offered by our Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, those pieces extensively reported by the media. Other policies should also be abolished for normal relations to develop between the United States and Cuba. No one should intend to have the Cuban people renounce the destiny it chose in freedom and sovereignty, the same for which you have made enormous sacrifices. We also discussed international issues, particularly those that could have an impact on regional peace and stability. We had thought to discuss other issues, but we did not have enough time. I had planned to raise our concern over the destabilization some are trying to promote in Venezuela, something which we consider to be counterproductive to the overall situation in the continent. I did not have the chance to raise with him, I'm raising it here. Likewise, we talked about the ongoing peace process in Colombia and the effort to put an end to that conflict. There are profound differences between our countries that will not go away. Since we hold different concepts on many subjects such as political systems, democracy, the exercise of human rights, social justice, international relations and world peace and stability. We defend human rights. In our view, civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are indivisible, interdependent and universal. Actually, we find it inconceivable that a government does not defend and insure the right to health care, education, Social Security with provision and development, equal pay and the rights of children. We oppose political manipulation and double standards in the approach to human rights. Cuba has much to say and show on this issue. That is why I have reiterated to the President our willingness to continue moving forward with the dialogue on this matter that was already initiated. On December 17th, 2014, as we announced the decision to re- establish diplomatic relations, I said that we should learn the art of co- existing with our difference in a civilized manner. In my remarks to Parliament on July 15, 2015, I said changing everything that needs to be changed is the sovereign and exclusive concern of Cubans. The revolutionary government is willing to advance to a normalization of relations, for it is convinced that both countries can co-exist and cooperate in a civilized manner and for the mutual benefit regardless of existing and future differences and thus contribute to peace, security, stability, development and equity in our continent and around the world. Today, I reaffirm that we should exercise the art of civilized co-existence, which involves accepting and respecting differences and preventing these from becoming the center of our relationship. We should instead promote links that can benefit both our countries and peoples while focusing on those things that bring us closer and not on those that pull us apart. We agree that a long and complex path still lies ahead. But what is most important is that we have started taking the first steps to build a new type of relationship, one that has never existed between Cuba and the United States. Actually, destroying a bridge can be an easy and quick undertaking. However, its solid reconstruction can prove a lengthy and challenging endeavor. After four failed attempts and giving proof of the will and perseverance, on September 2, 2013, American swimmer Diane Nyad managed to cross the Florida Strait swimming without an anti-shark cage to protect her. To that exploit of conquering the geographical differences between our two countries. It was for that exploit that on August 30th, 2013, as the national anthems of Cuba and the United States were played she was presented with the Order of Sport Merit, a declaration awarded by the State Counsel. Such feat carries a powerful message. One that should serve as an example to honor bilateral relations. For it confirms that if she could do it, then we can do it too. President Obama, I reiterate our appreciation for his visit and the willingness of the government of Cuba to continue moving forward in the well being of our countries. Thank you very much. President Obama:  Buenas tardes.  President Castro, to you, the Cuban government and the Cuban people, thank you for the welcome that you have extended to me, to my family, and to my delegation.  For more than half a century, the sight of a U.S. President here in Havana would have been unimaginable.  But this is a new day -- es un nuevo da -- between our two countries. With your indulgence, Mr. President, I want to go just briefly off topic because during this weekend, I received news that one of our outstanding United States Armed Service members, Marine Staff Sergeant Louis F. Cardin of Temecula, California, was killed in northern Iraq as we assisted the Iraqi government in dealing with ISIL, the terrorist organization there.  And I just wanted to give my thoughts and prayers to the family there and those who have been injured.  It's a reminder that even as we embark on this historic visit, there are U.S. Armed Service members who are sacrificing each and every day on behalf of our freedom and our safety.  So Im grateful to them. My wife, Michelle, and I brought our daughters -- and by the way, they don't always want to go with us; theyre teenagers now.  They have friends at home and they have things to do -- but they wanted to come to Cuba because they understood, and we wanted to show them, the beauty of Cuba and its people.  We were moved by the Cubans who received us yesterday, smiling and waving, as we drove in from the airport.  We were grateful for the opportunity to experience Old Havana -- had some excellent Cuban food.  Our visit to the Cathedral was a reminder of the values that we share, of the deep faith that sustains so many Cubans and Americans.  And it also gave me an opportunity to express my gratitude to Cardinal Ortega, who, along with His Holiness Pope Francis, did so much to support the improved relations between our governments.  This morning, I was honored to pay tribute to Jos Mart -- not only his role in Cuban independence, but the profound words that he wrote and spoke in support of liberty and freedom everywhere. I bring with me the greetings and the friendship of the American people.  In fact, Im joined on this trip by nearly 40 members of Congress -- Democrats and Republicans.  This is the largest such delegation of my presidency, and it indicates the excitement and interest in America about the process that weve undertaken.  These members of Congress recognize that our new relationship with the Cuban people is in the interest of both nations.  Im also joined by some of Americas top business leaders and entrepreneurs because were ready to pursue more commercial ties, which create jobs and opportunity for Cubans and Americans alike. And Im especially pleased that Im joined on this trip by so many Cuban Americans.  For them, and for the more than two million proud Cuban Americans across the United States, this is a moment filled with great emotion.  Ever since we made it easier to travel between our countries, more Cuban Americans are coming home.  For many, this is a time of new hope for the future. So, President Castro, I want to thank you for the courtesy and the spirit of openness that youve shown during our talks.  At our meeting in Panama last year, you said that were willing to discuss every issue, and everything is on the table.  So with your understanding, my statement will be a little longer than usual. President Castro always jokes with me about how long Castro brothers speeches can be.  But Im going to actually go a little longer than you probably today, with your indulgence.  We have a half a century of work to catch up on. Our growing engagement with Cuba is guided by one overarching goal -- advancing the mutual interests of our two countries, including improving the lives of our people, both Cubans and Americans.  Thats why Im here.  Ive said consistently, after more than five very difficult decades, the relationship between our governments will not be transformed overnight.  We continue, as President Castro indicated, to have some very serious differences, including on democracy and human rights.  And President Castro and I have had very frank and candid conversations on these subjects. The United States recognizes progress that Cuba has made as a nation, its enormous achievements in education and in health care.  And perhaps most importantly, I affirmed that Cubas destiny will not be decided by the United States or any other nation.  Cuba is sovereign and, rightly, has great pride.  And the future of Cuba will be decided by Cubans, not by anybody else. At the same time, as we do wherever we go around the world, I made it clear that the United States will continue to speak up on behalf of democracy, including the right of the Cuban people to decide their own future.  Well speak out on behalf of universal human rights, including freedom of speech, and assembly, and religion.  Indeed, I look forward to meeting with and hearing from Cuban civil society leaders tomorrow. But as you heard, President Castro has also addressed what he views as shortcomings in the United States around basic needs for people, and poverty and inequality and race relations.  And we welcome that constructive dialogue as well -- because we believe that when we share our deepest beliefs and ideas with an attitude of mutual respect, that we can both learn and make the lives of our people better. Part of normalizing relations means that we discuss our differences directly.  So Im very pleased that weve agreed to hold our next U.S.-Cuba human rights dialogue here in Havana later this year.  And both of our countries will welcome visits by independent United Nations experts as we combat human trafficking, which we agree is a profound violation of human rights. Even as we discuss these differences, we share a belief that we can continue to make progress in those areas that we have in common.  President Castro, you said in Panama that we might disagree on something today on which we would agree tomorrow.  And thats certainly been the case over the past 15 months and the days leading up to this visit.  And today, I can report that we continue to move forward on many fronts when it comes to normalizing relations. Were moving ahead with more opportunities for Americans to travel to Cuba and interact with the Cuban people.  Over the past year, the number of Americans coming here has surged.  Last week, we gave approval for individual Americans to come here for educational travel.  U.S. airlines will begin direct commercial flights this year.  With last weeks port security announcement, weve removed the last major hurdle to resuming cruises and ferry service.  All of which will mean even more Americans visiting Cuba in the years ahead and appreciating the incredible history and culture of the Cuban people. Were moving ahead with more trade.  With only 90 miles between us, were natural trading partners.  Other steps we took last week -- allowing the U.S. dollar to be used more widely with Cuba, giving Cubans more access to the dollar in international transactions, and allowing Cubans in the U.S. to earn salaries - these things will do more to create opportunities for trade and joint ventures.  We welcome Cubas important announcement that it plans to end the 10 percent penalty on dollar conversions here, which will open the door to more travel and more commerce.  And these steps show that were opening up to one another. With this visit, weve agreed to deepen our cooperation on agriculture to support our farmers and our ranchers.  This afternoon, Ill highlight some of the new commercial deals being announced by major U.S. companies.  And just as I continue to call on Congress to lift the trade embargo, I discussed with President Castro the steps we urge Cuba to take to show that its ready to do more business, which includes allowing more joint ventures and allowing foreign companies to hire Cubans directly. Were moving ahead with our efforts to help connect more Cubans to the Internet and the global economy.  Under President Castro, Cuba has set a goal of bringing Cubans online.  And we want to help.  At this afternoons entrepreneurship event, Ill discuss additional steps were taking to help more Cubans learn, innovate, and do business online -- because in the 21st century, countries cannot be successful unless their citizens have access to the Internet. Were moving ahead with more educational exchanges.  Thanks to the generous support of the Cuban-American community, I can announce that my 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative will offer new opportunities for university students to study abroad -- more Americans at Cuban schools and more Cubans at U.S. schools.  And going forward, educational grants and scholarships will be available to Cuban students.  And in partnership with the Cuban government, well offer more English language training for Cuban teachers, both in Cuba and online. Even as Cubans prepare for the arrival of the Rolling Stones, were moving ahead with more events and exchanges that bring Cubans and Americans together as well.  We all look forward to tomorrows matchup between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban National Team. More broadly, were moving ahead with partnerships in health, science, and the environment.  Just as Cubans and American medical teams have worked together in Haiti against cholera, and in West Africa against Ebola -- and I want to give a special commendation to Cuban doctors who volunteered and took on some very tough assignments to save lives in West Africa in partnership with us and other nations.  We very much appreciate the work that they did.  Our medical professionals will now collaborate in new areas, preventing the spread of viruses like Zika and leading new research into cancer vaccines.  Our governments will also work to protect the beautiful waters of this region that we share. And as two countries threatened by climate change, I believe we can work together to protect communities and our low-lying coasts.  And we're inviting Cuba to join us and our Caribbean and Central American partners at this springs regional energy summit in Washington. And finally, we're moving ahead with our closer cooperation on regional security.  We're working to deepen our law enforcement coordination, especially against narco-traffickers that threaten both of our peoples.  I want to thank President Castro and the Cuban government for hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC.  And we remain optimistic that Colombians can achieve a lasting and just peace.  And although we did not have an extensive discussion of Venezuela, we did touch on the subject.  And I believe that the whole region has an interest in a country that is addressing its economic challenges, is responsive to the aspirations of its people, and is a source of stability in the region.  That is, I believe, an interest that we should all share. So again, President Castro, I want to thank you for welcoming me.  I think its fair to say that the United States and Cuba are now engaged across more areas than any time during my lifetime.  With every passing day, more Americans are coming to Cuba, more U.S. businesses and schools and faith groups are working to forge new partnerships with the Cuban people.  More Cubans are benefitting from the opportunities that this travel and trade bring. As you indicated, the road ahead will not be easy.  Fortunately, we dont have to swim with sharks in order to achieve the goals that you and I have set forth.  As you say here in Cuba, echar para adelante.  Despite the difficulties, we will continue to move forward.  We're focused on the future. And Im absolutely confident that if we stay on this course, we can deliver a better and brighter future for both the Cuban people and the American people. Muchas gracias.  Thank you very much. First question, Jim Acosta. Question:  [As interpreted.]  Thank you, President Castro, for your hospitality in Havana.  And thank you, Mr. President. [In English.]  In your meeting with President Castro, what words did you use to urge him to pursue democratic reforms and expand human rights here in Cuba?  Will you invite President Castro to the White House?  We know hes been to New York.  And why did you not meet with Fidel Castro? And, President Castro, my father is Cuban.  He left for the United States when he was young.  Do you see a new and democratic direction for your country?  And why you have Cuban political prisoners?  And why dont you release them?  And one more question, who do you prefer -- Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, as I think we both indicated, we had a very fruitful conversation around issues of democracy and human rights.  Our starting point is that we have two different systems -- two different systems of government, two different economies.  And we have decades of profound differences, both bilaterally and internationally. What I have said to President Castro is that we are moving forward and not looking backwards; that we dont view Cuba as a threat to the United States.  I hope that my visit here indicates the degree to which we're setting a new chapter in Cuban-American relations. But as is true with countries around the world where we have normalized relations, we will continue to stand up for basic principles that we believe in.  America believes in democracy.  We believe that freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and freedom of religion are not just American values, but are universal values.  They may not express themselves exactly in the same way in every country, they may not be enshrined in the founding documents or constitutions of every country the same way, or protected legally in exactly the same ways, but the impulse -- the human impulse towards freedom, the freedom that Jos Mart talked about, we think is a universal longing. President Castro I think has pointed out that, in his view, making sure that everybody is getting a decent education or health care, has basic security in old age -- that those things are human rights, as well.  I personally would not disagree with him. But it doesnt detract from some of these other concerns.  And the goal of the human rights dialogue is not for the United States to dictate to Cuba how they should govern themselves, but to make sure that we are having a frank and candid conversation around this issue and hopefully that we can learn from each other. It does not mean that it has to be the only issue we talk about.  Economics, health, scientific exchanges, international cooperation on issues of regional as well as global import are also important.  But this is something that we are going to stay on.  And I actually welcome President Castro commenting on some of the areas where he feels that we're falling short because I think we should not be immune or afraid of criticism or discussion, as well. Heres the one thing I do know is that when I talk to Cuban Americans -- and, Jim, youre second generation, and so I think I speak not for you directly, but for many that I talk to around the United States -- I think there is enormous hope that there can be reconciliation.  And the bridge that President Castro discussed can be built between the Cuban American community and Cubans here.  There are family ties and cultural ties that are so strong.  And I think everyone would benefit from those ties being reestablished. One of the impediments to strengthening those ties is these disagreements around human rights and democracy.  And to the extent that we can have a good conversation about that and to actually make progress, that, I think, will allow us to see the full flowering of a relationship that is possible.  In the absence of that, I think it will continue to be a very powerful irritant.  And this is not unique to U.S.-Cuban relations.  Its one that, as you know, I have conversations with when we go to bilateral meetings with some of our very close allies, as well as countries that we dont have as close of a relationship to.  But I think it is something that matters.  And Ive met with people who have been subject to arbitrary detention, and thats something that I generally have to speak out on because I hear from them directly and I know what it means for them. Excuse me. President Raul Castro:  [As interpreted.]  I was asking if his question was directed to me or to President Obama.  You talked about political prisoners. President Obama:  I think the second one was addressed to you.  Trump and Hillary. President Raul Castro:  [As interpreted.]  For him or for me? Question:  [As interpreted.]  For you, Mr. President. President Raul Castro:  What did you say about the political prisoners?  Can you repeat that question about political prisoners?  Did you ask if we had political prisoners? Question:  I wanted to know if you have Cuban political prisoners and why you dont release them. President Raul Castro:  Give me the list of political prisoners and I will release them immediately.  Just mention a list.  What political prisoners?  Give me a name or names.  After this meeting is over, you can give me a list of political prisoners.  And if we have those political prisoners, they will be released before tonight ends. Question:  And Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, President Castro? President Raul Castro:  [As interpreted.]  Well, I cannot vote in the United States. Question:  [As interpreted.]  My question is for President Raul Castro.  Im from Cuban TV.  President Raul Castro, you have repeatedly stated, and today once again, that we must learn to coexist in a civilized manner with our differences.  Could you broaden this concept?  This is a historical moment that we are living. And then I have a brief question for President Obama.  President Obama, could U.S. government give more space to eliminate U.S. blockade during your mandate so that another generation of Cubans would not have to suffer this economic and commercial blockade against Cuba? President Raul Castro:  [As interpreted.]  The first question was for me.  Please repeat your question, because I couldnt hear well. Question:  [As interpreted.]  You have said repeatedly that we must learn to coexist in a civilized manner with our differences. President Raul Castro:  Well, President Obama himself has referred to that.  We have given the first steps - many for being the first steps.  And we must continue giving these steps.  And Im sure that we will be able to coexist peacefully in an environment of mutual cooperation as we are doing already in many fields for the benefit of both countries and with the benefit of other countries as we have already done -- in Haiti, with the cholera and in Africa with the Ebola.  That is the future of mankind if we want to save the humans species.  The level of water grows and the island may become smaller. You are asking too many questions to me.  I think questions should be directed to President Obama. President Obama:  So we have administratively already made a number of modifications on the embargo.  I referred to a number of them in my opening statement.  And weve actually been fairly aggressive in exercising as much flexibility as we can, given that the law putting the embargo in place has not been repealed by Congress.  There may be some technical aspects of the embargo that we can still make adjustments on, depending on problems as they arise. So, for example, the issue around the dollar and the need to make modifications in terms of how the embargo was implemented to encourage, rather than discourage reforms that the Cuban government itself is willing to engage in and to facilitate greater trade and commerce, that is something that grew out of the dialogue between our governments, and we have made appropriate adjustments to it.  It will take some time for commercial banks to understand the new rules, but we actually think that this is an area where we can improve current circumstances. But Ill be honest with you that the list of things that we can do administratively is growing shorter, and the bulk of changes that have to be made with respect to the embargo are now going to rely on Congress making changes. Ive been very clear about the interests in getting that done before I leave.  Frankly, Congress is not as productive as I would like during a Presidential election year.  But the fact that we have such a large congressional delegation with Democrats and Republicans with us is an indication that there is growing interest inside of Congress for lifting the embargo. As I just indicated in my earlier answer, how quickly that happens will, in part, depend on whether we can bridge some of our differences around human rights issues.  And that's why the dialogue I think is so important.  It sends a signal that at least theres engagement between the two countries on these matters. Now, I promised the President I would take one more question.  Andrea Mitchell of NBC. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Do you feel, after your meeting today, that you have made enough progress to even accelerate the pace and that the Cuban government is able to move quickly enough so that the changes that you have made through these technical adjustments to the embargo will be permanent, cannot be reversed by the next President?  And what advice have you given to President Castro about the ability of having the blockade, the embargo lifted?  Because he has said again today this is a continuous issue which is blocking progress, from their standpoint. And you said the conversations about human rights were frank and candid and that you want to move forward.  But even as you were arriving, there were dramatic arrests of peaceful protests -- the Ladies in White.  What signal does that send?  Can you have civilized coexistence at the same time you have such profound disagreements about the very definitions of what human rights means, as President Castro expressed today? And for President Castro, for many of us, it's remarkable to hear you speak about all these subjects.  Can you tell us what you see in the future?  President Obama has nine months remaining.  You have said you would be stepping down in 2018.  What is the future of our two countries, given the different definitions and the different interpretations of profound issues like democracy and human rights? Thank you. President Obama:  Well, Andrea, the embargo is going to end.  When, I can't be entirely sure, but I believe it will end.  And the path that we're on will continue beyond my Administration.  The reason is logic.  The reason is that what we did for 50 years did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people. And as I said when we made the announcement about normalization of relations, if you keep on doing something over and over again for 50 years and it doesnt work, it might make sense to try something new. And that's what we've done.  And the fact that there has been strong support not just inside of Congress, not just among the American people, but also among the Cuban people indicates that this is a process that should and will continue. Having said that, lifting the embargo requires the votes of a majority in Congress, and maybe even more than a majority in the Senate.  And as I indicated to President Castro, two things I think will help accelerate the pace of bringing the embargo to an end.  The first is to the degree that we can take advantage of the existing changes that weve already made and we see progress, that will help to validate this change in policy. So, for example, we have said that it is no longer a restriction on U.S. companies to invest in helping to build Internet and broadband infrastructure inside of Cuba.  It is not against U.S. law, as it's been interpreted by the Administration.  If we start seeing those kinds of commercial deals taking place and Cubans are benefitting from greater access to the Internet -- and when I go to the entrepreneurship meeting later this afternoon, I understand that we're going to meet some young Cubans who are already getting trained and are facile in using the Internet, theyre interested in startups -- that builds a constituency for ending the embargo.  If we build on the work that we're doing in agriculture, and you start seeing more U.S. farmers interacting with Cuban farmers, and theres more exports and imports -- that builds a constituency and the possibility of ending the embargo increases.  So hopefully taking advantage of what we've already done will help. And the second area, which we've already discussed extensively, is the issue of human rights.  People are still concerned about that inside of Cuba. Now, keep in mind Ive got fierce disagreements with the Chinese around human rights.  Ill be going to Vietnam later this year -- I have deep disagreements with them as well.  When we first visited Burma, people questioned whether we should be traveling there because of longstanding human rights violations in our view.  And the approach that Ive taken has been that if I engage frankly, clearly, stating what our beliefs are but also being clear that we can't force change on any particular country -- ultimately it has to come from within -- then that is going to be a more useful strategy than the same kinds of rigid disengagement that for 50 years did nothing. I guess ultimately what this comes down to, Andrea, is I have faith in people.  I think that if you meet Cubans here and Cubans meet Americans, and theyre meeting and talking and interacting and doing business together, and going to school together and learning from each other, then theyll recognize people are people.  And in that context, I believe that change will occur. Okay, now Im done, but Seor Presidente, I think Andrea had a question for you just about your vision.  It's up to you.  He did say he was only going to take one question and I was going to take two.  But I leave it up to you if you want to address that question. Question:  Por favor. President Obama:  Andrea, shes one of our most esteemed journalists in America, and Im sure shed appreciate just a short, brief answer. President Raul Castro:  Andrea -- Question:  Mr. President. President Raul Castro:  [As interpreted.]  There is a program here to be fulfilled.  I know that if I stay here, you will ask 500 questions.  I said that I was going to answer one.  Well, I answered one and a half.  President Obama has already helped me out with the answer here, Andrea.  I was reading something about human rights, but Im going to make the question to you now.  There are 61 international instruments recognized.  How many countries in the world comply with all the human rights and civil rights that have been included in these 61 instruments?  What country complies with them all?  Do you know how many?  I do.  None. None, whatsoever.  Some countries comply some rights; others comply others.  And we are among these countries.  Out of these 61 instruments, Cuba has complied with 47 of these human rights instruments.  There are countries that may comply with more, theres those that comply with less. I think the human rights issue should not be politicized.  That is not correct.  That is a purpose that will stay the same way.  For example, for Cuba, the desire for all the rights.  Do you think theres any more sacred right than the right to health, so that billions of children dont die just for the lack of a vaccine or a drug or a medicament?  Do you agree with the right to free education for all those born anywhere in the world or in any country?  I think many countries don't think this is a human right.  In Cuba, all children are born in a hospital and they are registered that same day, because when mothers are in advance pregnancy they go to hospitals days before, many days before delivery, so that all children are born in hospitals.  It doesnt matter if they live in faraway places or in mountains or hills.  We have many other rights -- a right to health, the right to education. And this is my last example that I will mention.  Do you think that for equal work, men get better paid than women just for the fact of being women?", "filename": "21March2016JointPressConferencewithPresidentRaulCastro.txt"}, {"question": "And we are grateful to all those who responded and risked their own lives to save others.  Malian security forces and all our own diplomatic security agents rushed in to pull people to safety.  French troops and American forces who were in the country for training missions provided support, as did United Nations forces.  And thanks to the swift action and skill of all involved, many people escaped and lives were saved, and the terrorists were prevented from causing even more bloodshed.  But I want the American people to know that we're still working to account for Americans who may have been at the hotel and to ensure the safety of all of our citizens in Mali.  Like the heinous attacks we saw in Paris -- and attacks we see all too often elsewhere -- this is another awful reminder that the scourge of terrorism threatens so many of our nations.  And once again, this barbarity only stiffens our resolve to meet this challenge.  We will stand with the people of Mali as they work to rid their country of terrorists and strengthen their democracy.  With allies and partners, the United States will be relentless against those who target our citizens.  Well continue to root out terrorist networks.  We will not allow these killers to have a safe haven.  And as I've seen throughout my trip this week, nations around the world -- including countries represented here today --are united in our determination to protect our people; to push back on the hateful ideologies that fuel this terrorism; and to stand up for the universal values of tolerance and respect for human dignity that unites us and makes us stronger than any terrorist.  This is the work we must do together.  This is the future that we have to build together.  And that's why Im here today.  I want to thank everyone at the ASEAN Business Advisory Council for welcoming us.  Those of you here today represent the strength and diversity of all 10 ASEAN nations.  Im pleased that were joined by our friends from the American Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council.  And I especially want to thank our outstanding hosts -- the government and people of Malaysia, this years ASEAN chair.  Terima kasih banyak. Now, as I mentioned before, Southeast Asia holds a special place in my heart.  As a boy, I lived in Indonesia where for many years my mother dedicated herself to empowering rural women.  And as President, Ive worked to deepen Americas engagement in this region.  I was proud to be the first U.S. President to meet with the leaders of all 10 ASEAN countries -- the first U.S. President to attend the East Asia Summit, and this visit marks my sixth meeting with ASEAN. And today, ASEAN is one of the largest markets for U.S. exports, and American businesses invest more in ASEAN than any other of these regions.  Its one of the reasons that, while Ive been in office, weve boosted our exports across Asia by more than 50 percent, to record levels.  And I congratulate all the ASEAN nations, after many years of work, on launching the new ASEAN Community.  I look forward to becoming the first U.S. President to visit Laos when it hosts ASEAN next year. Americas closer ties with this region are part of a larger story.  When I became President, I made a strategic decision that after a decade in which the United States had focused so heavily elsewhere, especially the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, that we would rebalance our foreign policy and play a larger and long-term role here in the Asia Pacific. I made this decision with an appreciation of history -- how the United States, as a Pacific power, has been a stabilizing presence here for seven decades.  And I made it with an eye on the future -- because as the home of half of humanity and some of the fastest-growing markets in the world, the security and prosperity of the Asia Pacific is vital to the national interests of the United States.  And deeper partnerships with our allies and partners in this region can help us meet global challenges, including terrorism. So I put forward a vision of the future our nations can build together:  A future of mutual security and peace where international law and norms are upheld and where disputes are resolved by dialogue and diplomacy.  A future of open markets and trade that is free and fair.  A future of freedom, where government is based on the will of the people, citizens are empowered by democratic governance and the inherent dignity and human rights of all people are upheld. In pursuit of this vision, the United States has deepened our engagement with the region across the board.  Weve strengthened our alliances.  Weve modernized our defense posture.  More U.S. forces are rotating through more parts of the region for training and exercises.  Weve expanded our cooperation with emerging powers and economies, like Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and India.  Were working to build a constructive relationship with China, where we cooperate more where our interests align, even as we candidly confront areas of disagreement. Weve stood up for democracy, for human rights and for development.  Weve called for a return to civilian rule in Thailand.  And were forging new partnerships to help educate girls and young women in Cambodia.  Just yesterday, I met with some extraordinary young people from our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative -- more than 55,000 young innovators who are going to shape this region for decades to come.  And were going to sustain our engagement with the people of Myanmar.  The landslide victory of Aung San Suu Kyis National League of Democracy gives hope for a Burma that is inclusive and united, peaceful and democratic.  In other words, even as the United States has dealt with pressing challenges in other parts of the world, our rebalance to Asia Pacific has continued full force.  And now, were ready to take the next step by moving ahead with the highest-standard trade agreement in history -- the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Four of your nations are already part of TPP -- Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.  Along with the United States, it also includes Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Peru and Chile.  When implemented, it wont just boost trade and support jobs in our 12 countries, it will help set stronger rules for trade across the Asia Pacific.  And thats what I want to talk about today. I know that the politics around trade can be hard -- in all of our countries.  Past agreements havent always lived up to their promises.  In recent decades, with the rise of globalization and technology, some workers, especially in developed countries, have seen their jobs exported abroad or replaced by automation.  Ive seen it in my home state of Illinois, as manufacturing plants shut down and jobs dried up over the last two decades.  And all of this has made many people skeptical of trade agreements -- despite the fact that American manufacturing has added some 900,000 new jobs in the past few years, growing for the first time in more than a decade.  Meanwhile, some industries that are protected from competition by subsidies or tariffs -- and the political interests that represent those industries -- often resist efforts to change the status quo.  So, for all these reasons, a new trade deal like TPP can be a tough sell.  But the answer is not to stop trading -- to try to build barriers that close any individual country off from the global economy.  Its not possible anymore.  Our economies are more integrated than ever.  Companies like yours rely on global supply chains.  The answer is to do trade the right way -- and thats what TPP does.  Ive been making the case for TPP to the American people, including our Congress, where I am confident we will get approval and move forward.  I know there are similar debates in TPP countries here in Asia.  And as business leaders, you can make your voices heard.  So Im not going to recount all the reasons why this is such a good deal.  But I would encourage you to remind people back home that this trade pact is a win for all of our countries.  Its a win for our 12 TPP countries.  By eliminating tens of thousands of tariffs -- essentially taxes -- on goods, on each others products, TPP removes old barriers and opens new markets. The United States is already one of the most open economies in the world.  And when the high tariffs among our TPP partners come down also, it will create new opportunities for everybody.  Malaysia will be able to sell more cell phones to Mexico.  Singapore can sell more medicine to Peru.  Vietnam will be able to sell more leather goods to Japan.  The list goes on.  TPP is a win for the United States.  Im not going to be shy about this.  As President of the United States, I make no apologies for fighting to open markets to American companies and workers.  And weve had success.  U.S. exports have reached record highs, and we know that companies that export tend to grow faster, hire more employees and pay their workers more than companies that do not export.  And so, by eliminating some 18,000 tariffs that other countries put on American exports, TPP levels the playing field for our workers and businesses -- which means  American manufacturers will be able to sell more cars and trucks, equipment and machinery.  American farmers and ranchers will be able to sell more dairy, fruits, poultry and beef -- and theres no steak like an American steak.  You agree.    The bottom line is, Americans are ready to compete.  With TPP, youll be seeing more products with that label were so proud of -- Made in America.  And TPP is a win for the kind of trade that companies and workers in our countries need to compete in the 21st century.  It makes sure that globalization is working for us, and not against us.  For example, TPP strengthens protections for intellectual property so innovations are less likely to be stolen or pirated. It encourages more trade in services, which is a larger and larger proportion of our economies and our workforces.  As the first trade agreement to truly embrace the digital economy, it encourages e-commerce.  It simplifies customs, which makes it easier for all companies to export, especially small and medium-sized businesses that create many of the jobs in our countries and have more difficulty navigating through a lot of bureaucracy in trying to export to other countries. But the message I really want to deliver today is this -- TPP is more than just a trade pact; it also has important strategic and geopolitical benefits.  TPP is a long-term investment in our shared security and in universal human rights. I want to be very clear -- trade is not a panacea.  Its not a cure-all for the range of challenges our nations face.  But we know from experience that when trade is done right it can help fuel progress in other areas.  Let me be specific.  First, TPP will help build greater trust and cooperation among nations.  Weve long understood that trade can help bring countries and regions closer.  Take the example of the post-World War II era, where the free nations of Europe set out to bind themselves together in what would become the European Union.  Over many decades, the United States helped fashion the international institutions and global trading system that have stitched our economies together and helped prevent another war between major powers.  There is a link between economic security and national security, and that's at the heart of ASEAN.  So TPP will help to advance the economic integration that underwrites peace and stability in this region. Second, TPP will bind the United States even closer to some of our strongest allies in Asia.  Its no coincidence that around the world many of our treaty allies are also some of our strongest trading partners.  Theres a virtuous circle -- our alliances are the foundation for our security, which becomes the foundation of our prosperity, which allows us to invest in the sources of our strength, including our alliances.  The United States has treaty obligations to the security of our allies, Japan and Australia, a longstanding defense relationships with New Zealand.  With greater trade and ties under the TPP, we and our allies will be investing in our mutual security for generations to come. Third, TPP will allow the United States to forge even deeper partnerships with countries that are playing a rising role in this region.  Here in Malaysia, new starts-ups and investments in entrepreneurship have made this country a hub of innovation.  Vietnam has one of the regions fastest-growing economies.  With greater prosperity comes greater responsibility, and both Malaysia and Vietnam are, indeed, doing more.  So the United States is working with both countries to ensure maritime security, to uphold the freedom of navigation, to ensure that disputes in the region are resolved peacefully.  And as they grow their economies under TPP, Malaysia and Vietnam will be able to make even greater contributions to regional security. Fourth, TPP will allow our countries, together, to write the rules for trade in the Asia Pacific for decades to come.  Our nations are more secure and more prosperous when everybody plays by the same rules.  And what are those rules?", "filename": "21November2015ASEANBusinessandInvestmentSummitAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Have a seat. Thank you so much.  Well, hello, West Virginia!   Go, Mountaineers!  It is great to be back in what is clearly one of the most beautiful states in the United States of America.  One of these days, Im going to finally try a Tudors Biscuit.    I want to begin by thanking Jordan for sharing his extraordinary story with us.  Jordan is living proof that, when it comes to substance abuse, treatment and recovery, those things are possible if we work together and if we care about each other. And thats what were here to talk about today.   We've got some outstanding leaders who care deeply about this issue.  I want to thank your Governor, Earl Ray Tomblin, for being here.  Your two fine senators -- Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito.  And Charleston Mayor Danny Jones.  Weve also got some outstanding members of my administration who are here -- first and foremost, our proud daughter of West Virginia, HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell.  We have the Director of National Drug Control Policy, Michael Botticelli.  And we have the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Chuck Rosenberg.  Wheres Chuck?  Hes around here somewhere.  And what I want to do is to have a conversation with the panelists here today, take some questions -- because this is something that is not a top-down solution type of problem alone. This is going to have to be everybody working together.  And we've got to understand what families are going through, what law enforcement is going through, what our health systems are going through in order for us to wrap our arms around this problem.  So instead of giving a long speech, I just want to offer some initial thoughts to frame our discussion. When I came into office, I started studying this issue -- whats called opioids.  And I was stunned by the statistics.  More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses than they do from motor vehicle crashes.  More than they do from car accidents.  The majority of those overdoses involve legal prescription drugs.  In 2013 alone, overdoses from prescription pain medications killed more than 16,000 Americans.  One year.  I don't have to tell you, this is a terrible toll.  The numbers are big, but behind those numbers are incredible pain for families.  And West this state is home to the highest rate of overdose deaths in the nation.   Now, addiction is not new.  But since 1999, sales of powerful prescription pain medications have skyrocketed by 300 percent. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for these drugs, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills.   And as their use has increased, so has the misuse.  Some folks are prescribed these medications for good reason but they become addicted because theyre so powerful.  At the same time, weve seen a dramatic rise in the use of heroin, which belongs to the same class of drugs as painkillers -- this class of drugs known as opioids.  In fact, four in five heroin users -- new heroin users -- started out by misusing prescription drugs; then they switched to heroin.  So this really is a gateway drug -- that prescription drugs become a gateway to heroin.  As a consequence, between 2002 and 2013, the number of heroin-related deaths in America nearly quadrupled, although the number of heroin-related overdoses is still far exceeded by the number of legal prescription drug overdoses.   So this crisis is taking lives.  Its destroying families.  Its shattering communities all across the country.  And thats the thing about substance abuse -- it doesnt discriminate.  It touches everybody -- from celebrities to college students, to soccer moms, to inner city kids.  White, black, Hispanic, young, old, rich, poor, urban, suburban, men and women.  It can happen to a coal miner; it can happen to a construction worker; a cop who is taking a painkiller for a work-related injury.  It could happen to the doctor who writes him the prescription.  Now, one of the problems we have is too many families suffer in silence, feeling like they were the only ones struggling to help a loved one.  And lets face it, theres still fear and shame and stigma that too often surrounds substance abuse -- and often prevents people from seeking the help that they deserve.  Because when people loosely throw around words like junkie, nobody wants to be labeled in that way.  And part of our goal here I think today is to replace those words with words like father, or daughter, or son, or friend, or sister.  Because then you understand there is a human element behind this.  This could happen to any of us in any of our families.  What if we replaced a word like junkie with recovery coaches and specialists like Jordan?   We cant fight this epidemic without eliminating stigma.  That's one of the reasons why Im so proud of Michael, whos the first person in the job of dealing with drugs in America who actually knows what its like to recover from an addiction.  He shares his own story as a way to encourage others to get the help that they need before its too late.  And Im proud that theres some elected officials in this state whove told their stories about what happened in their family and to themselves in order for us to start lowering those attitudes that keep people from getting help. So Ive made this a priority for my administration.  And we're not new to this.  In 2010, we released our first National Drug Control Strategy.  We followed that up in 2011 with a Prescription Drug Abuse Prevention Plan.  Were implementing those plans.  We're partnering with communities to prevent drug use, reduce overdose deaths, help people get treatment.  And under the Affordable Care Act, more health plans have to cover substance abuse disorders.  The budget that I sent Congress would invest in things like state overdose prevention programs, preparing more first responders to save more lives, and expanding medication assisted treatment programs.   So we have to make those investments.  Rather than spending billions of dollars -- taxpayer dollars -- on long prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, we could save money and get better outcomes by getting treatment to those who need it.    And we could use some of the savings to make sure that law enforcement has the resources to go after the hardened criminals who are bringing hard drugs like heroin into our country.  So with no other disease do we expect people to wait until they're a danger to themselves or others to self-diagnose and seek treatment.  Every other disease -- you got a broken leg, you got diabetes, you got some sort of sickness, we understand that we got to get you help.  And we also understand when it comes to other diseases that if we don't give you help, and let you suffer by yourself, then other people could get sick.  Well, this is an illness.  And we got to treat it, as such.  We have to change our mindset.    And this is one of the reasons that the DEA declared a National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day -- a day when Americans can safely and conveniently dispose of expired and unwanted prescription drugs in their communities.  Because most young people who begin misusing prescription drugs dont buy them in some dark alley -- they get them from Mom or Dads medicine cabinet.   And today, were also announcing some new actions.  First, were ensuring that federal agencies train federal health care providers who prescribe opioids.  This is a common-sense idea that youre already implementing here in West Virginia.  Congress should follow that lead and make this a national priority.  And we look forward to working with governors and the medical community as well. Second -- and we were talking -- Joe and I were talking on the flight over here -- there is evidence that shows that medication assisted treatment, if done properly, in combination with behavioral therapy and other support and counseling and 12-step programs and things like that, can work.  It can be an effective strategy to support recovery.  But it can't just be replacing one drug with another.  Its got to be part of a package.  So were going to identify any barriers that still exist that are keeping us from creating more of these treatment facilities, and incorporating them into our federal programs. Private sector partners are helping out to help fight this epidemic, as well.  And I want to give them some credit.  More than 40 medical groups, from the American Medical Association to the American Dental Association are committing to concrete actions.  And we need to, obviously, work with the medical community -- because they're the front lines on prescribing this stuff and so theres got to be a sense of responsibility and ownership and accountability there.  Weve got to expand prescriber training.  Increasing the use of naloxone -- I wanted to make sure I was pronouncing that right, so I talked to the expert -- naloxone -- this is something that if first responders have it can often save quickly the lives of somebody who is having an overdose.  So we want to make sure that first responders have a supply of this. We want to make sure that we're getting more physicians certified to provide medication assisted treatment.  We then have broadcasters like CBS that are providing airtime for education and awareness.  And groups like the NBA have committed to running public service announcements about drug abuse.  So that's just an example of some of the private sector partnerships that we're forging here.   The point is -- and Im going to end with this -- weve all got a role to play.  Because young people like Jordan, they remind us these are our kids.  Its not somebody elses kids; its our kids.  Its not somebody elses neighborhood; its our neighborhood.  And they deserve every chance.  Weve got to make sure that we're doing right by them, we're taking this seriously.  And the goal today is to shine a spotlight on this, and then make sure that we walk away out of here, all of us committed to doing something about it.  Whether we are a faith leader, whether we are an elected official, whether we're in law enforcement, whether we're a private citizen, a business, weve all got a role to play.  You understand that here in West Virginia, and we want to make sure the whole country understands how urgent this problem is. So with that, Im going to turn it over to our moderator, Michael Botticelli. Director Botticelli:  Well, good afternoon, everybody.  Thank you for being here today.  I, too, want to thank Jordan for his really stirring comments.  I think it really exemplifies for us the challenges that we have, but also the success and hope that comes with recovery.  It's really astounding. We're here in West Virginia today to highlight the issue not just because of the impact that it's had on West Virginia, but the impact that its had across the country.  But also, West Virginia is working together to implement strategies to really deal with this addiction, and we're proud to be here to help support that. The President always gives me a lot of credit for talking openly and honestly about my recovery, but, candidly, I'm one of millions of Americans who are in recovery today and my story is not unique.  Maybe this part is a little bit unique, sir.   But I'm one of millions of Americans who have been restored by getting good care and treatment.  And I know the President wants what Jordan and I got, and that is a second chance to be restored to productive members of our communities and to give back what we've so freely been given. So, thank you, sir. So with that today, we have a great panel of people who are really going to help provide us with information and their insights about what more we can do on the federal level.  I'm really proud to be a colleague of Secretary Silvia Burwell.   And, Secretary, I'm going to start -- you can feel free to say anything you would like, however.  I know we're here in your home state of West Virginia.  I know -- we have talked -- you have been personally impacted by this.  But youve also made this a key priority for all of your HHS agencies.  So may you could talk a little bit about your experience and what HHS is doing to deal with this issue. Secretary Burwell:  Absolutely.  And first, I'll just say I love coming home.  It's great to be home.  And it's great to welcome the President to the great state of West Virginia. And when I became Secretary, this was a priority because it is something that I have personally experienced.  Everybody, I'm sure, in this room knows people personally -- friends that lost to the addiction and what happens in terms of their children, in terms of their family, in terms of the community.  And what your experience is, personally, I think that is what energizes you to act.   And at the department, what we focused on over the last year, figuring out an evidence-based strategy -- because we want to get results, we want to change the kinds of things that people have experienced personally -- and three things.  Number one is changing prescribing practices.  When the President said the 259 million -- that can't be right.  And so how do we work on that.  Second is working on medication assisted treatment, getting people the access we've talked about today being so important to people.  And third is that access to naloxone.  And I look at our colleagues in law enforcement because theyre usually the front line -- and making sure that when something does go wrong, in terms of that overdose, that we can prevent those deaths, those deaths that are so dramatically impacting the state. So those are the three things.  I'm going to stop because we're here to listen today.   Thank you, Michael. Director Botticelli:  Cary Dixon, you're a mom of a son who is struggling with -- in treatment now, unfortunately in prison. But youve turned your struggles into advocacy and action, and you provide support for many, many parents here and around the country for loved ones who are dealing with this.  So what has your experience been?  What advice do you give parents?  What advice do you give us as federal folks about how we can support parents in this battle?", "filename": "21October2015CommunityForumAddressonPrescriptionDrugAbuse.txt"}, {"question": "We are sad and uncomfortable when acquaintances ask us about our loved ones.  And we're even more sad when they ask us about every other member of our family and don't mention our loved ones.  We neglect our marriages.  We neglect other children in our home who are thriving because all of our attention is focused on addiction and substance abuse.   We disagree endlessly about the right way to handle this problem.  And after experiencing years of turmoil, we rest better at night when our loved ones are incarcerated, because the place that you never dreamed that your loved one would ever even see, a jail or a prison, is safer than them being on the street, interacting with drug dealers, or pushing a needle into their arm. The ones of us who are fortunate, we lay awake at night and we plan our loved ones funerals in our mind.  The ones of us who aren't fortunate actually do plan the funerals, in reality, of our loved ones.  And this is where addiction has taken us.  This is where substance abuse has taken us.   Now, all that being said, there is hope.  And that's probably the most important thing to remember here.  We're so grateful to Recovery Point and Matt Ball [ph] and people in recovery that are helping others.  We're grateful to our mayor, the mayor of Huntington, Steve Williams, who has so tirelessly and endlessly spearheaded programs to help our community recover. Don Purdue [ph] who has made it possible for people to receive treatment in our communities.   I think education is important.  And I was fortunate to find a group called The Loved Ones Group, developed by a man named Ed Hughes.  It's a series that helps provide education and information and support for family members or those who care about someone with an addiction.  The final week of this program we get to speak to people in recovery.  They come and speak to our group of people there.  And it inspires us because we know that recovery is possible and that it can happen.   For too long, we've been silent.  And I think is going to answer your question as parents and family members, because of the stigma of this disease and the shame that we feel, we've been silent.  And I think that is holding us back.  We need to open our voices so that people don't feel ashamed.  This is a disease. It is a sickness.  But education, educating ourselves as much as we can as family members, and speaking out to raise awareness is, I think, critical in helping the situation. I'm almost finished.  People in 12-step recovery groups and different groups rely on a higher power.  I'm a person of faith, and my faith has helped me navigate this journey that we've been on.  And I just want to share with you a verse that I hold dear for my own family member who is sick, but also offer it to others.  Jeremiah 29:11 -- For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. And I believe that every person in the throes of addiction and the disease of substance abuse needs hope in a future.  And I believe this for their families as well. Thank you so much.  Director Botticelli:  Cary, thank you so much for sharing your story.  It obviously touched everybody here in terms of not only your struggles, but articulating the hope that's on the other side.  And we will continue to work with parents as we deal together with this epidemic. I go to Dr. Michael Brumage.  You have been involved in this work for many years.  You're here at the local level, so love to hear your experience and share what you think are both some successes and challenges in dealing with this issue. Dr. Brumage:  Certainly.  And thank you very much.  Welcome to West Virginia, Mr. President and Mr. Botticelli.  Welcome home, Secretary Burwell. I've been on the job actually only 79 days here in Charleston.  I came back home after being 29 years away.  And I knew what I was coming into when I came home.  I knew there was a heroin and opioid abuse epidemic in the state.  I knew we had the highest rates of Hepatitis B and the second highest rates of Hepatitis C in the nation, largely due to needle sharing among addicts.  But I also knew that coming home that Mountaineers would take this kind of challenge head on.  That's the kind of people that there are in the state of West Virginia.  And so I wanted to be part of the solution here in the state.  And I knew it would require patience, persistence, and people -- lots of good people here. With the help of so many community partners, and my good friend and colleague over at Cabell-Huntington Health Department, Dr. Mike Kilkenney, we've been able to get some programs off the ground, working together.  And I think we're moving in the right direction.  In about six weeks, we're going to begin our own harm reduction program here in Charleston.  We're going to have syringe exchange as part of that.  We'll be testing for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, HIV.  We don't want to become another Scott County, Indiana, where they had an outbreak of HIV -- almost 200 cases in a small rural community there.   Wed also like to offer contraceptive services to women of the reproductive age who are addicted to drugs to prevent neonatal abstinence syndrome as well.   And more than anything else, what I think wed like to do is to treat the people who come through our doors for this program with dignity and respect and the kind of love that they deserve, because the ultimate disease underlying every addiction, from my perspective, is disconnection and alienation from themselves and from everybody else around them.   Two weekends ago, I began working with West Virginia University researchers on a program of mindfulness-based relapse prevention with opioid addicts in recovery.  This is based off of the pioneering work done at the University of Washington.  And one of the more pleasant surprises that I've seen since I've been here on the job is the close connection between public health and public safety.  Our law enforcement community has just been outstanding and we've been really privileged to work with them. Finally, I was able to also sit together with delegate, Dr. Chris Stansbury from Kanawha County to sponsor legislation -- hes going to sponsor legislation to make naloxone an over-the-counter medication, the way it is in 14 other states.   And then, as youve said, Mr. President, this is a multifaceted issue.  It requires a lot of different people to come together to fix this.  It's not a quick fix; it requires a collaborative, multiagency approach with public health, mental health, primary care, schools and school nurses, law enforcement. our own judiciary community.  And finally, I'd be remiss if I left out our business and industry, because jobs provide not only an income, they provide a sense of purpose and meaning in the lives of people. And so I'm hoping that by the end of your visit today, Mr. President, that youll be impressed with some of the things that are going on and how much West Virginians are really digging in to try to address this issue.  Thank you.  Director Botticelli:  Thank you, Doctor. Chief Webster, Dr. Brumage gave you the perfect lead-in and segue to talk about the importance of public health and public safety collaboration.  So love to hear your thoughts and what you're doing here. Chief Webster:  Sure.  First of all, I'd like to, again, thank the President of the United States for making this a focus, coming to Charleston, West Virginia, and also providing me an opportunity to represent Charleston and all law enforcement, effectively. I think this is where most people probably look at the person in uniform and they probably say, okay, this is the guy who is now going to tell us we need to build more jails and make tougher laws.  And that's not me.  This is such an epidemic and we cannot arrest our way out of this mess.  And I think the President touched on it briefly.  What the President said earlier is true, because we want to arrest the violent drug dealers that are creating havoc in our communities. We have our share of violent crime.  And we are very fortunate -- our drug task force, we have a great partnership with [inaudible.]  They fund so many of our efforts.  So, on a daily basis, the bad guy get arrested.  We made a significant seizure yesterday. So we feel in law enforcement, as I'm sure our counterparts do, we really attack the supply side of this issue very well.  And so we're not going to back down from that and we're going to keep trying to remove people that are dangerous from society.  But whats nice about this, and what I want to talk about, though, is attacking as a strategy the demand side.  And that's what I think is very nice about this panel and this gathering, because we've got a lot of things we can really talk about. We basically have a community of zombies, for lack of a better word, walking around.  They need treatment very badly.  And theyre coming up to our officers -- they actually are -- some don't want help yet, but at some point they do want help.  And we want to get them help.  And a couple of the strategies that we've worked on that we want to attack the demand side, not so much the supply in this conversation, is that we have trained our officers in naloxone.  And that's been traditionally, up until very recently, just something that our fire department-- and they do more of the -- they can do the nasal and the IV.  We trained all of our officers, regardless of their assignment, to be able to save somebodys life -- administer the nasal and the rescue breathing mask that's accompanied.  And again, that's paid for with Appalachian -- and such great partnership.  They recognize that it's supply and demand. Interestingly, though, when I went to the roll call to start talking about this to the officers, first, theyre kind of like, that might be more of a fire department role.  That might be more -- but as we talked more and I went down the line and said, well, has anybody have anybody affected by an addiction, and I've yet to go to one roll call -- I've been to numerous, but I've yet to one where someone said no.  Someone has said, yes, my sister, my aunt. And we've just got them mounted to our cars in the last week, so we don't have any success stories -- and we don't want to have any stories, really, unless theyre -- we want them all to be positive.  But we know the fire department will continue to administer most of them in our camp.  But we want to be in a position to save a life -- much like a child drowning and we can administer CPR. Another thing that we're doing that we're real proud of and it's working with the United States Attorney, which is the LEAD program, the Law enforcement assisted diversion program.  And basically, since 2014, we've had 39 I'd call them low-level users that were selling drugs to support their habits.  And basically theyre hit with a stark decision right at the arrest gate:  You have an opportunity to go to jail, or you can seek immediate treatment.  And of the 39 people that have taken us up on that, since 2014, just one has been rearrested.  I think that's pretty impressive.  And that's a partnership with the U.S. Attorneys Office and something that our officers are coming around to understanding what kind of problem we have.   And I would just say, finally, because we do support everything Dr. Brumage and the Kanawha County Health Department is doing with his harm reduction plan, and how we factor into that with the needle exchange program -- finally, we have a Handle With Care program that we piloted in 2013 in one school on the West Side, then a second school, and now we do it for the whole city.  I see some smiles in the crowd because there are teachers in here.   But what we realized had been lost is when police officers go to crime scenes, what are they there for?  Theyre there to take witness statements.  Theyre there to arrest the so-called bad guy.  And then they leave.  But who is looking out for the children, the collateral damage?  Whos looking out for the child that maybe is just trying to do his homework, mom and dad are fighting.  We come in, arrest dad.  Mom cries.  Shes got to go to the hospital.  And so that child gets left behind many, many times.  And so we started a notification system to where the next day, our officers that are on the scene will send a notification to the principal or to the counselor basically to say, handle that child with care today.  Maybe that child needs an extra day before --    Those are ways that we realize that we're not going to arrest our way out of this.  We have our place and we can always use additional law enforcement resources.  I'm not going to lie to you.   But we're all in this together and it's affecting all of us.  Director Botticelli:  Thank you, Chief.  I think that's an extraordinary example of your willingness and your partnership. I'm now going to turn to Susan Shumate from the Charleston Gazette, who I believe is going to ask questions of the panel that come from the community. Ms. Shumate:  Thank you for coming to West Virginia, Mr. President, Secretary Burwell and Secretary Botticelli and the rest of the panel to address the chronic issue of opioid addiction.  The Charleston Gazette now has done numerous stories over lots of years about this issue facing West Virginia, and we were able to solicit hundreds of questions from our readers over the last five days for the President and the panel.   And with us here is David and Kate Grubb with their question for the President. Question:  First of all, mom -- Cary -- there isn't a parent here who had a dry eye when you spoke.  From your heart, you expressed exactly what we feel.  And Danny knows this, too.  Mr. President, I want to say that it is -- and I'm going to take this opportunity -- it is wonderful to have an intelligent, caring, thoughtful person in your position.  President Obama:  Thank you.   Question: Thank you so much for coming.  This issue -- my wife and I, we have five daughters.  Mr. President, you might relate a little bit to that. President Obama:  I can relate to that.  I don't know how you did five.   Two keeps me busy. Question:  And we live here in the East End.  My second oldest daughter, Jessica, has been battling heroin addiction for seven years.  Ironically, the last time we were in this room was when our daughter was in the 8th grade here at Roosevelt and was a cheerleader.  She made good grades.  She was socially involved.  Her future was bright.  But as Jordan mentioned, her life got put on hold for a long time.   Last month, the middle of August, our daughter overdosed.  We found her in her bedroom, tourniquet on her arm, syringe next to her.  She was already turning blue.   My wife administered CPR.  We called 911.  While we were waiting I held her and said, don't leave us yet.  Fortunately -- I want to say this to the Chief -- the response was amazing.  Less than five minutes, the EMTs and the police officers were there.  The police officers were sympathetic.  They were helpful. The EMTs administering Narcan, coupled with the CPR, saved our daughters life.  And shes now in recovery.     This is her fourth time.  It usually takes more than one time.  And we think this one will be the one.  We are full of hope.  But we understand the pain -- the pain in this room, the pain the families feel.  The concern we have is access -- where do you get the treatment?  How do you get the treatment? And, Cary, you mentioned it.  As soon as this overdose happened, we called hotlines and we got numbers to call and we called those numbers, and they said, well, theres a three-month wait -- or, well, we don't take Medicaid cards -- or, this wasnt really the facility that could handle your type of problem. The other problem with Medicaid cards and things of that nature is you can't always go out of state.  What if the facility is across the river?  We're a border state -- we need to be able to have that ability to go to the facility that may be best for our children.   The bottom line is we need resources and we need to find a way to put those resources into effect so that we have the facilities.  Because theres so many people that want help, like our daughter, but it took forever to find a place for her.  Right now shes in Michigan.  That was the best we could do.  Why can't we have lots of these types of facilities with trained staff here in West Virginia, close to home?    And lastly, I want to say one of the best provisions of the Affordable Care Act is that it does require coverage for drug treatment.  And thank you for that.  But one of the concerns is that if there arent facilities available, then the treatment coverage can be illusory.  So we have to close that gap.   And I think the biggest issue there is are you concerned, as sometimes we get concerned given the current political climate that the Affordable Care Act will be weakened or repealed either before the end of your term or in the next term?  What are your feelings about our commitment to that program and to the drug rehabilitation part of that program?", "filename": "21October2015CommunityForumAddressonPrescriptionDrugAbuse.txt"}, {"question": "Democrats and Republicans were both responsible for wanting to look tough on the War on Drugs and ramping up incarceration.  It wasnt just one side or another.  And now both at the same time are realizing, you know what, what are we doing here?  Why is it that we're willing to invest $20,000 a year in incarcerating a young person when we might have spent a few thousand dollars on the front end to avoid them going to prison in the first place?  And that mindset means that resources hopefully will start channeling in a new direction.  But weve got to make sure that the money is following the insight.  I think we're at the stage now where people are starting to realize that we need more treatment.  But the budgets are not yet reflective of that awareness.  And that's going to require Congress. So in our budget, for example, we're proposing an additional $133 million for enhanced treatment and prevention programs.  But its also going to involve states, state legislatures, counties, local governments, all also recognizing this is something that every community needs.  And we can't be stigmatizing this.  Having a treatment facility is just like having a health clinic for any other illness because its affecting people just as much.  And we know how to do this when we do it smartly.  Think about smoking -- and I can say this as an ex-smoker who still chews on Nicorette -- which is okay, its expensive, but I can afford it.   Better not starting, though, young people.   If you look at how drastically weve been able to reduce the smoking rates, despite the fact that we never outlawed smoking -- but what we did was we just enhanced education, made it more difficult for kids to access it, stopped peddling it, stopped advertising it, took some of the money out of it.  And over time, a public health model had a drastic impact on smoking.   And Nicorette is -- or nicotine is as addictive as any of the drugs we're talking about.  So if we could do on that with the public health model, theres no reason we can't do it here, as well.  But it does require a change in mindset.  And as you pointed out, it requires additional money. Last point Ill make -- on the insurance side.  You are absolutely right that insurance coverage is not enough if there is no treatment center for you to apply that insurance.  So we're going to have to build and fund and support more treatment centers locally.    On the other hand, if there is a treatment center and you don't have any insurance, then you might have to mortgage your house.  And I am very proud of the fact that the Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- which I -- I mean I wont get on a soapbox here, but theres 17 million people who have health insurance who didn't have it.  And by the way, our overall costs for health care have been going up at the slowest rate in my lifetime after we passed the law.  So its not bankrupting the government, not bankrupting states.    But one of the things that it does is it requires that insurance -- private insurance that's sold on the marketplaces that are subsidized by the federal government have to provide coverage for substance abuse programs.  And given the prevalence of whats happening to our children and our schools, the notion that we would not have our insurance policies cover this -- they're going to cover a broken leg, but they're not going to cover a situation where your child might die?  That doesn't make any sense. And so I think that we're trying to nudge that along through the marketplaces.  But I think one of the things that we need to do is to have consumer groups and our medical associations and others really push a little bit more on the insurance companies to say that this is something that is vital, and that everybody should have coverage.  Because you don't know if its going to be your child.  And that's the most important point here.   Cary, is carrying a particular burden.  And I was most touched when Cary talked about her other children.  But I thought about Malia and Sasha.  They're wonderful girls, but they're teenagers.  They do some things.   And I remember me being a teenager -- and Ive written about this, I did some stuff.   And Ive been very honest about it.  So what I think about is there but for the grace of God, and that's what we all have to remember.  And when we do, then I think weve got a chance to make a real change.  But thank you for sharing your story.    Ms. Shumate:  This was from Natalie Laliberty, who is a principal at Ruthlawn Elementary School.  And she says, as the principal of an elementary school, I see the harm being done to kids who are born addicted or live in traumatic and chaotic drug environment.  Many of the kids have any number of learning and behavioral problems upon entering preschool and kindergarten.  How can the community at large and schools work together to intervene in these childrens lives during their early years when brain growth stimuli is most critical?  Thank you.  President Obama:  Well, Ill make sure to get the doctor involved in this one, as well.  And I know that Sylvia and others through HHS were working on this a lot. Ill just make two quick comments.  Number one, we know that you learn more between the time you're born and three years old than you will ever learn the reset of your life.  You are a sponge at that age.  And so the more we can invest in early childhood education, prenatal education for parents, home visitation with at-risk moms.  And we know who they are.  If you're a poor teenage single mom who maybe doesn't have a lot of support, then you are just much more likely to not know how to express the love you have for your child effectively, even if you love them just as much as we love our kids.  But you just don't have the tools.  So that has got to be an emphasis at the state and local levels.  That's where we can really make a difference. But us being able to target at-risk parents, new parents, young parents, that can be extraordinarily helpful. The second thing that Ill just say -- and then maybe, Doctor, you might want to chime in on this -- and here Im going to be a little controversial, but Im in my last term, I only got a year left.   And its not like my poll numbers are that high.   I figure I can go ahead and say it.  I think one of the benefits of conversation like this is to highlight the fact that income and race make a difference here.  The truth of the matter is, is that poor communities are more vulnerable.   One of the useful things about this forum is we're all vulnerable, but its almost like if you're healthy and you get sick, you have more antibodies and resistance.  And if you're poor -- or if youre already weakened and you get sick, then you're more vulnerable, right?   There are some communities we know that are more vulnerable, and the kids there are more vulnerable.  And part of what I hope this discussion does is to remind us that just as it could be Malia or Sasha, or Carys kids, or any of our kids, those kids who don't always look like us and don't live in the same neighborhood as us, they're just as precious.  And their parents are much less equipped than you, sir, or I would be in terms of dealing with this stuff.  And we got to get them help, too.   So I think the doctor earlier talked about the importance of jobs and economic development and broad-based approaches so that growth helps everybody.  There is some connection to substance abuse and the vulnerabilities that communities have.  And weve got -- and lets face it, part of the reason West Virginia probably has more cases partly has to do with the economics that have been taking place in some of these communities, which is why its so important for us to also push on that front, as well. Doctor, any thoughts on that question about the vulnerability of children and how we can get to them quicker, more effectively? Dr. Brumage:  Yes, Mr. President.  One of the things that Im hoping to kick off here next week is a discussion about probably one of the most important studies that most people have never heard of called the Adverse Childhood Experiences Study.  The baseline study was done with 17,000 people at Kaiser Permanente in San Diego, California.  And what they found out was that when people score high on a scale of 10 questions -- everybody has a score from zero to 10, the higher you are on that scale, the more likely you are to have problems with addiction with IV drug use, with smoking, with obesity, with all the public health problems that we're really seeing right now.  I think a trauma-informed community and an open discussion about where these problems are going is the first step in addressing why people are using drugs in the first place.  And, Mr. President, you're absolutely right.  What happens in those early years and reaching out to those families who we know are at risk and devoting the kind of resources that we would need to is really the first step I think in really truncating this.  Because if we don't, what we're going to be doing 25, 30 years from now is having the same discussion about why these kids are abusing drugs, obese, and so on and so forth.  So I think that that's a really important part and to have that sort of open discussion about that.  Because it happens in good families, as well as in families who are disadvantaged. But I agree with you it happens probably more often in families that are disadvantaged.  And it perpetuates the cycle of poverty, as well. President Obama:  And for those of us who are more advantaged, the disadvantaged communities create the markets that then seep into the more advantaged communities, right?", "filename": "21October2015CommunityForumAddressonPrescriptionDrugAbuse.txt"}, {"question": "As we meet here today, men and women and children are being tortured, detained and murdered by the Syrian regime.

Cultivo una rosa blanca.1 In his most famous poem, Jose Mart made this offering of friendship and peace to both his friend and his enemy.  Today, as the President of the United States of America, I offer the Cuban people el saludo de paz.2 Havana is only 90 miles from Florida, but to get here we had to travel a great distance -- over barriers of history and ideology; barriers of pain and separation.  The blue waters beneath Air Force One once carried American battleships to this island -- to liberate, but also to exert control over Cuba.  Those waters also carried generations of Cuban revolutionaries to the United States, where they built support for their cause.  And that short distance has been crossed by hundreds of thousands of Cuban exiles -- on planes and makeshift rafts -- who came to America in pursuit of freedom and opportunity, sometimes leaving behind everything they owned and every person that they loved. Like so many people in both of our countries, my lifetime has spanned a time of isolation between us.  The Cuban Revolution took place the same year that my father came to the United States from Kenya.  The Bay of Pigs took place the year that I was born. The next year, the entire world held its breath, watching our two countries, as humanity came as close as we ever have to the horror of nuclear war.  As the decades rolled by, our governments settled into a seemingly endless confrontation, fighting battles through proxies.  In a world that remade itself time and again, one constant was the conflict between the United States and Cuba. I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas. I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people. I want to be clear:  The differences between our governments over these many years are real and they are important.  Im sure President Castro would say the same thing -- I know, because Ive heard him address those differences at length.  But before I discuss those issues, we also need to recognize how much we share.  Because in many ways, the United States and Cuba are like two brothers whove been estranged for many years, even as we share the same blood. We both live in a new world, colonized by Europeans.  Cuba, like the United States, was built in part by slaves brought here from Africa.  Like the United States, the Cuban people can trace their heritage to both slaves and slave-owners.  Weve welcomed both immigrants who came a great distance to start new lives in the Americas. Over the years, our cultures have blended together.  Dr. Carlos Finlays work in Cuba paved the way for generations of doctors, including Walter Reed, who drew on Dr. Finlays work to help combat Yellow Fever.  Just as Mart wrote some of his most famous words in New York, Ernest Hemingway made a home in Cuba, and found inspiration in the waters of these shores.  We share a national past-time -- La Pelota -- and later today our players will compete on the same Havana field that Jackie Robinson played on before he made his Major League debut. And it's said that our greatest boxer, Muhammad Ali, once paid tribute to a Cuban that he could never fight -- saying that he would only be able to reach a draw with the great Cuban, Teofilo Stevenson. So even as our governments became adversaries, our people continued to share these common passions, particularly as so many Cubans came to America.  In Miami or Havana, you can find places to dance the Cha-Cha-Cha or the Salsa, and eat ropa vieja.  People in both of our countries have sung along with Celia Cruz or Gloria Estefan, and now listen to reggaeton or Pitbull.  Millions of our people share a common religion -- a faith that I paid tribute to at the Shrine of our Lady of Charity in Miami, a peace that Cubans find in La Cachita. For all of our differences, the Cuban and American people share common values in their own lives.  A sense of patriotism and a sense of pride -- a lot of pride.  A profound love of family.  A passion for our children, a commitment to their education.  And that's why I believe our grandchildren will look back on this period of isolation as an aberration, as just one chapter in a longer story of family and of friendship. But we cannot, and should not, ignore the very real differences that we have -- about how we organize our governments, our economies, and our societies.  Cuba has a one-party system; the United States is a multi-party democracy.  Cuba has a socialist economic model; the United States is an open market.  Cuba has emphasized the role and rights of the state; the United States is founded upon the rights of the individual. Despite these differences, on December 17th 2014, President Castro and I announced that the United States and Cuba would begin a process to normalize relations between our countries. Since then, we have established diplomatic relations and opened embassies.  We've begun initiatives to cooperate on health and agriculture, education and law enforcement.  We've reached agreements to restore direct flights and mail service.  We've expanded commercial ties, and increased the capacity of Americans to travel and do business in Cuba. And these changes have been welcomed, even though there are still opponents to these policies.  But still, many people on both sides of this debate have asked:  Why now?  Why now? There is one simple answer:  What the United States was doing was not working.  We have to have the courage to acknowledge that truth.  A policy of isolation designed for the Cold War made little sense in the 21st century.  The embargo was only hurting the Cuban people instead of helping them.  And I've always believed in what Martin Luther King, Jr. called the fierce urgency of now3 -- we should not fear change, we should embrace it. That leads me to a bigger and more important reason for these changes:  Creo en el pueblo Cubano.  I believe in the Cuban people. This is not just a policy of normalizing relations with the Cuban government.  The United States of America is normalizing relations with the Cuban people. And today, I want to share with you my vision of what our future can be.  I want the Cuban people -- especially the young people -- to understand why I believe that you should look to the future with hope; not the false promise which insists that things are better than they really are, or the blind optimism that says all your problems can go away tomorrow.  Hope that is rooted in the future that you can choose and that you can shape, and that you can build for your country. I'm hopeful because I believe that the Cuban people are as innovative as any people in the world. In a global economy, powered by ideas and information, a countrys greatest asset is its people.  In the United States, we have a clear monument to what the Cuban people can build: its called Miami.  Here in Havana, we see that same talent in cuentapropistas, cooperatives and old cars that still run.  El Cubano inventa del aire. Cuba has an extraordinary resource -- a system of education which values every boy and every girl. And in recent years, the Cuban government has begun to open up to the world, and to open up more space for that talent to thrive.  In just a few years, we've seen how cuentapropistas can succeed while sustaining a distinctly Cuban spirit.  Being self-employed is not about becoming more like America, its about being yourself. Look at Sandra Lidice Aldama, who chose to start a small business.  Cubans, she said, can innovate and adapt without losing our identityour secret is in not copying or imitating but simply being ourselves. Look at Papito Valladeres, a barber, whose success allowed him to improve conditions in his neighborhood.  I realize Im not going to solve all of the worlds problems, he said.  But if I can solve problems in the little piece of the world where I live, it can ripple across Havana. Thats where hope begins -- with the ability to earn your own living, and to build something you can be proud of.  Thats why our policies focus on supporting Cubans, instead of hurting them.  Thats why we got rid of limits on remittances -- so ordinary Cubans have more resources.  Thats why were encouraging travel -- which will build bridges between our people, and bring more revenue to those Cuban small businesses. Thats why weve opened up space for commerce and exchanges -- so that Americans and Cubans can work together to find cures for diseases, and create jobs, and open the door to more opportunity for the Cuban people. As President of the United States, Ive called on our Congress to lift the embargo. It is an outdated burden on the Cuban people.  It's a burden on the Americans who want to work and do business or invest here in Cuba.  It's time to lift the embargo.  But even if we lifted the embargo tomorrow, Cubans would not realize their potential without continued change here in Cuba. It should be easier to open a business here in Cuba.  A worker should be able to get a job directly with companies who invest here in Cuba.  Two currencies shouldnt separate the type of salaries that Cubans can earn. The Internet should be available across the island, so that Cubans can connect to the wider world -- and to one of the greatest engines of growth in human history. Theres no limitation from the United States on the ability of Cuba to take these steps.  Its up to you.  And I can tell you as a friend that sustainable prosperity in the 21st century depends upon education, health care, and environmental protection.  But it also depends on the free and open exchange of ideas.  If you cant access information online, if you cannot be exposed to different points of view, you will not reach your full potential.  And over time, the youth will lose hope. I know these issues are sensitive, especially coming from an American President.  Before 1959, some Americans saw Cuba as something to exploit, ignored poverty, enabled corruption.  And since 1959, weve been shadow-boxers in this battle of geopolitics and personalities.  I know the history, but I refuse to be trapped by it. Ive made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity, nor the intention to impose change on Cuba.  What changes come will depend upon the Cuban people.  We will not impose our political or economic system on you.  We recognize that every country, every people, must chart its own course and shape its own model.  But having removed the shadow of history from our relationship, I must speak honestly about the things that I believe -- the things that we, as Americans, believe.  As Mart said, Liberty is the right of every man to be honest, to think and to speak without hypocrisy.4 So let me tell you what I believe.  I can't force you to agree, but you should know what I think.  I believe that every person should be equal under the law. Every child deserves the dignity that comes with education, and health care and food on the table and a roof over their heads. I believe citizens should be free to speak their mind without fear -- to organize, and to criticize their government, and to protest peacefully, and that the rule of law should not include arbitrary detentions of people who exercise those rights. I believe that every person should have the freedom to practice their faith peacefully and publicly.  And, yes, I believe voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections. Not everybody agrees with me on this.  Not everybody agrees with the American people on this.  But I believe those human rights are universal. I believe they are the rights of the American people, the Cuban people, and people around the world. Now, theres no secret that our governments disagree on many of these issues.  Ive had frank conversations with President Castro.  For many years, he has pointed out the flaws in the American system -- economic inequality; the death penalty; racial discrimination; wars abroad.  Thats just a sample.  He has a much longer list.  But heres what the Cuban people need to understand:  I welcome this open debate and dialogue. Its good.  Its healthy.  Im not afraid of it. We do have too much money in American politics.  But, in America, it's still possible for somebody like me -- a child who was raised by a single mom, a child of mixed race who did not have a lot of money -- to pursue and achieve the highest office in the land.  That's whats possible in America. We do have challenges with racial bias -- in our communities, in our criminal justice system, in our society -- the legacy of slavery and segregation.  But the fact that we have open debates within Americas own democracy is what allows us to get better.  In 1959, the year that my father moved to America, it was illegal for him to marry my mother, who was white, in many American states.  When I first started school, we were still struggling to desegregate schools across the American South.  But people organized; they protested; they debated these issues; they challenged government officials.  And because of those protests, and because of those debates, and because of popular mobilization, Im able to stand here today as an African-American and as President of the United States.  That was because of the freedoms that were afforded in the United States that we were able to bring about change. Im not saying this is easy.  Theres still enormous problems in our society.  But democracy is the way that we solve them.  That's how we got health care for more of our people.  That's how we made enormous gains in womens rights and gay rights.  That's how we address the inequality that concentrates so much wealth at the top of our society.  Because workers can organize and ordinary people have a voice, American democracy has given our people the opportunity to pursue their dreams and enjoy a high standard of living. Now, there are still some tough fights.  It isnt always pretty, the process of democracy.   It's often frustrating.  You can see that in the election going on back home.  But just stop and consider this fact about the American campaign that's taking place right now.  You had two Cuban Americans in the Republican Party5, running against the legacy of a black man who is President, while arguing that theyre the best person to beat the Democratic nominee who will either be a woman or a Democratic Socialist.   Who would have believed that back in 1959?", "filename": "22March2016AddresstothePeopleofCuba.txt"}, {"question": "I want to thank a couple of outstanding members of Congress who are here.  Senator Michael Bennet -- where did Michael Bennet go?", "filename": "22May2015NationalJewishAmericanHeritageMonthAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Earlier this week, as I headed to this region, there was a headline in one of our publications back home that asked -- Obamas Asian Distraction?", "filename": "22November2015MalaysiaPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Which brings me to the point I want to emphasize today.  For more than a year, the United States has built and led a broad coalition against ISIL of some 65 nations.  Given the frequent focus on Americas leadership of this campaign, sometimes the contributions of our partners are overlooked.  In fact, since the G20, a number of our coalition members have stepped up with new commitments.  So today I want to take a moment to recognize how our allies and partners help advance every element of our strategy.   Nearly two dozen nations -- among them Turkey and our Arab partners -- contribute in some way to the military campaign, which has taken more than 8,000 strikes against ISIL so far.  And as Ive said, were ready to welcome or cooperate with other countries that are determined to truly fight ISIL as well.  Fifteen countries have deployed personnel to train and support local forces in Iraq.  The United Arab Emirates and Germany are organizing 25 coalition partners in helping to stabilize areas in Iraq liberated from ISIL.  Italy is coordinating the multinational effort to train Iraqi police.   On the political front, U.S. leadership brought all the key countries together in the Vienna to discuss a common understanding on the principles for ending the Syrian civil war. On the humanitarian front, the United States is helping to lead the effort to mobilize more aid for the Syrian people, including refugees.     More than 40 countries have now passed or strengthened laws to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters, and 34 nations, including the United States, have arrested foreign terrorist fighters.  Saudi Arabia is helping to coordinate the crackdown on ISIL financing.  The United Arab Emirates new messaging center is working to discredit ISILs propaganda, and Malaysia just announced the creation of its own center to do the same.  And by joining our summit at the United Nations that we organized this fall, more than 100 nations, more than 20 multilateral institutions and some 120 civil society groups -- including many leaders from Muslim communities around the world -- have become part of a global movement against ISIL and its twisted ideology. All of which is to say that our coalition will not relent.  We will not accept the idea that terrorist assaults on restaurants and theaters and hotels are the new normal -- or that we are powerless to stop them.  After all, thats precisely what terrorists like ISIL want, because, ultimately, thats the only way that they can win.  Thats the very nature of terrorism --they cant beat us on the battlefield, so they try to terrorize us into being afraid, into changing our patterns of behavior, into panicking, into abandoning our allies and partners, into retreating from the world.  And as President, I will not let that happen.     In our diverse societies, everybody can do their part.  And we will not give in to fear, or start turning on each other, or treating some people differently because of religion or race or background.  That wouldnt just be a betrayal of our values, it would also feed ISILs propaganda -- there assertion, which is absolutely false, that we must absolutely reject, that we are somehow at war with an entire religion.  The United States could never be at war with any religion because America is made up of multiple religions.  We're strengthened by people from every religion, including Muslim Americans.   So I want to be as clear as I can on this:  Prejudice and discrimination helps ISIL and undermines our national security.  And so, even as we destroy ISIL on the battlefield -- and we will destroy them -- we will take back land that they are currently in.  We will cut off their financing.  We will hunt down their leadership.  We will dismantle their networks and their supply lines, and we will ultimately destroy them.  Even as we are in the process of doing that, we want to make sure that we don't lose our own values and our own principles.  And we can all do our part by upholding the values of tolerance and diversity and equality that help keep America strong.   The United States will continue to lead this global coalition.  We are intensifying our strategy on all fronts, with local partners on the ground.  We are going to keep on rolling back ISIL in Iraq and in Syria, and take out more of their leaders and commanders so that they do not threaten us.  And we will destroy this terrorist organization.   And well keep working with our allies and partners for the opportunity and justice that helps defeat violent extremism.  Well keep standing up for the human rights and dignity of all people -- because that is contrary to what these terrorists believe.  That's part of how we defeat them.  And I'm confident we will succeed.  The hateful vision of an organization like ISIL is no match for the strength of nations and people around the world who are united to live in security and peace and in harmony. So with that, I'm going to take a couple of questions.  We'll start with Angela Greiling-Keane of Bloomberg. Question: Thank you, Mr. President.  You're scheduled to meet this week with President Hollande in Washington to talk about stepping up efforts against ISIL even further.  Given that Russia would be part of the coalition that France proposes, have you seen any signs in the past couple days of Russia redirecting its military efforts in Syria to actually focus on ISIL?  Are there any circumstances that you could see President Assad remaining in power, even if only temporarily, if that's what it took to effectively have a broad alliance directed at ISIL? And finally, as you've said, the U.S. wont work with Russia if their goal is to keep Assad in power.  If that's the case, is defeating ISIL or destroying ISIL a realistic goal?", "filename": "22November2015MalaysiaPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Question: Thank you, Mr. President.  On a different topic -- when you go to Paris next week for the climate talks, you do so in the shadow of what happened in that city a week ago.  Could you talk a little bit about how you think those terror attacks might affect the talks?  And substantively, on the talks, can you talk a little bit about concerns that the United States might not have the ability to convince poor countries that nations will help them pay for what they need to do to achieve the climate talks, given especially the Republican opposition back home?  And on one separate matter, could you comment on the investigations that we reported about in our paper this morning into whether or not intelligence officials are altering the assessments of the ISIL campaign to make them seem more rosy?", "filename": "22November2015MalaysiaPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Kevin Corke. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask you about what Secretary Carter said about expanding the rules of engagement versus ISIS.  What was that conversation like?  And what did he mean by that? And Id like to ask you also about immigration.  The high court is looking into executive action on immigration, as you know.  And I understand the sensitivity of it, you dont want to be prejudicial.  But Im curious, are you where you thought youd be in immigration reform?  And what would you say to family members who say, listen, we did it the right way, weve waited our turn in line -- how do these other guys get to skip the line, if you will?  And lastly, the Attorney General announced eight indictments of individuals in the U.S. and Mexico on sex trafficking and related charges.  Where is the fight against sex trafficking among the priorities for your Administration?  Are you where you thought youd be on that?", "filename": "22November2015MalaysiaPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "With respect to immigration reform, I cant comment on the ins and outs of the legal case.  Ive said before and Ill say again, I am confident that the rules and executive action that I put forward are squarely within the category of prosecutorial discretion that historically has been under a Presidents power. And youve got lower courts whove disagreed, but we think that past precedent is on our side.  Substantively, Ive got 11 million people in our countries, many of whom are working, paying taxes, our neighbors, coworkers, friends whove lived in the United States for a very long time.  Were not going to deport them, despite what some political leaders may say.  It would be contrary to who we are, would be too costly, is too impractical.  What we want to do is allow them to get out of the shadows and to get right with the law, pay a fine, go to the back of the line, but hopefully, over time, be contributors to society. Of course, none of this would be necessary if we just passed the legislation that was passed in the Senate with a bipartisan majority.  And I continue to believe that the ultimate solution is going to be one that comes from Congress.  And although, during this political season, it may be difficult for Republican leaders in either the House or in the Senate to resuscitate that legislation, my hope is, is that after the election, they will.  And in the interim, Im going to do everything I can to sensibly apply our immigration laws in a way that is reflective of the fact that we're a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. And just very briefly, with respect to sex trafficking -- this is a critical problem.  We take it very seriously.  We have entire divisions in our law enforcement agencies that are dedicated to this.  Ive elevated this within the White House so that we have people focusing specifically on ending trafficking. And in our international discussions -- most specifically, out here in Southeast Asia -- we are working very closely to promote mechanisms that will end trafficking.  In fact, TPP, one of the central mechanisms in TPP, to ensure high labor standards and human rights and human dignity, are requirements among the members who are signatories to have in place real, serious, enforceable ways to prevent the kind of human trafficking that causes such hardship and brutality for so many people.   And those of you who were with me when I visited the refugee center yesterday will recall the lovely young 16-year-old who was sitting next to me -- shes somebody who had been a victim of trafficking.  And it reminds you of the terrible toll that is often placed on children, people who are the most vulnerable, people who are least able to protect themselves.  And every country has an obligation to put an end to it.   David Nakamura. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You said moments ago that Americans should not give in to fear when it comes to these terrorist attacks.  But you also said that the person who may have been the person behind thinking about the attacks is not a mastermind and that anybody who can get their hands on some conventional weapons can -- and is willing to die can blow themselves up.  How should Americans feel that if they shouldnt be scared?  And if I may, The Washington Post and ABC News just this week came out with a poll that said 83 percent of the voting public believes that an attack, a terrorist attack against the U.S. with mass casualties is likely to happen in the near future, and 40 percent say its very likely.  Does that in your mind -- given the fact that you think the public should not be so fearful -- mean that the terrorists are winning?  And do you believe that this is sort of the new normal, and Americans will have to live with this kind of fear? President Obama:  David, I think that the American people are right to be concerned, and to expect that we in the government and in law enforcement are doing everything we can to disrupt terrorist attacks, to intercept intelligence that may lead us to individuals who are willing to carry out these attacks, that we make sure that these terrorists are not gaining the kinds of weaponry that would make it easier for them to cause mass attacks.  This is a serious problem.  And as somebody who more often than I would like has met with or comforted families of victims of terrorism, the losses are real and they're devastating.  So this is a serious problem.  And we have to work collectively across the board, as weve been doing since I became President and since previous administrations identified the kinds of organized terrorist activity like al Qaeda that weve seen -- weve got to do everything we can to stop it. But there is a difference between being vigilant and being concerned and taking this seriously and taking precautions and, in some cases, changing our security arrangements, as weve done, for example, in aviation -- theres a difference between smart applications of law enforcement and military and intelligence, and succumbing to the kind of fear that leads us to abandon our values, to abandon how we live, to abandon -- or change how we treat each other.   And the good news is, there, Americans actually have been resilient.  Theyve been tested.  We had a mass casualty attack on 9/11.  And as I said before, I was very proud of the fact that the fundamental nature of America and how we treated each other did not change.   I think we made some bad decisions subsequent to that attack in part based on fear, and that's why we have to be cautious about it.  We have to think things through.  But overall, the American people went about their lives.  Times Square is filled with people -- rightly so.  After the Boston bombing attack, folks went right back to the ballpark and sang, Take Me Out to the Ballgame.  That's what they needed to do. And so the message I have is that those of us who are charged with protecting the American people are going to do everything we can to destroy this particular network.  Once this network is destroyed -- and it will be -- there may be others that pop up in different parts of the world, and so we're going to have to continue to take seriously how we maintain the infrastructure that weve built to prevent this.  But it doesn't have to change the fundamental trajectory of the American people. And that we should feel confident about. And the media needs to help in this.  I just want to say -- during the course of this week, a very difficult week, it is understandable that this has been a primary focus.  But one of the things that has to happen is how we report on this has to maintain perspective, and not empower in any way these terrorist organizations or elevate them in ways that make it easier for them to recruit or make them stronger. They're a bunch of killers with good social media.  And they are dangerous, and theyve caused great hardship to people.  But the overwhelming majority of people who go about their business every day, the Americans who are building things, and making things, and teaching, and saving lives as firefighters and as police officers -- they're stronger.  Our way of life is stronger.  We have more to offer -- we represent 99.9 percent of humanity.  And that's why we should be confident that well win. Colleen McCain Nelson. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  You've threatened to veto the bill the House passed that would tighten screening procedures for Syrian refugees, but you've left the door open to legislation that is more constructive in the White Houses view.   President Obama:  Yes. Question: What specific changes to your refugee program would you support?  And do you think that Democrats who are calling for a halt to your program are betraying our countrys values, as you've suggested of some Republicans? And one last thing -- Im sorry -- separately.  Not a four-part question.   President Obama:  Just a two-parter.  Okay, go ahead. Question:  You met Friday with Prime Minister Najib, who is facing allegations of corruption and human rights violations.  And youd said at your town hall event that you would raise those issues with him when you spoke privately.  What was your message to Najib about the investments funds scandal and also about the issue of jailing his political opponents?", "filename": "22November2015MalaysiaPressConference.txt"}, {"question": "Today, I want every American to see how these men and women lived. You may have never met them, but you know them. They're your neighbors -- like Arthur Daniels, out there on the weekend, polishing his white Crown Victoria; and Kenneth Proctor, with his beloved yellow Mustang, who, if you asked, would fix your car, too. She was the friendly face at the store. Sylvia Frasier, with her unforgettable gold hair, who took a second job at Walmart because, she said, she just loved working with people. She was the diehard fan you sat next to at the game. Kathy Gaarde loved her hockey and her Caps, a season ticket holder for 25 years. They were the volunteers who made your community better. Frank Kohler, giving dictionaries to every third-grader in his county; Marty Bodrog, leading the children's Bible study at church. They lived the American Dream -- like Kisan Pandit, who left everything he knew in India for this land of opportunity, and raised a wonderful family and dedicated himself to the United States Navy. They were proud veterans -- like Gerald Read, who wore the Army uniform for more than 25 years; and Michael Arnold, who became one of the Navy's leading architects, of whom a colleague said, \"nobody knew those ships like him.\" They were dedicated fathers -- like Mike Ridgell, coaching his daughter's softball teams, joining Facebook just to keep up with his girls, one of whom said, \"he was always the cool dad.\" They were loving mothers -- like Mary Francis Knight, devoted to her daughters, and who had just recently watched with joy as her older daughter got married. They were doting grandparents -- like John Johnson, always smiling, giving bear hugs to his 10 grandchildren, and who would have welcomed his 11th grandchild this fall. These are not statistics. They are the lives that have been taken from us. This is how far a single act of violence can ripple. A husband has lost his wife. Wives have lost their husbands. Sons and daughters have lost their moms and their dads. Little children have lost their grandparents. Hundreds in our communities have lost a neighbor, and thousands here have lost a friend. As has been mentioned, for one family, the Daniels family, old wounds are ripped open again. Priscilla has lost Arthur, her husband of 30 years. Only a few years ago, as Mayor Gray indicated, another shooting took the life of their son, just 14 years old. \"I can't believe this is happening again,\" Priscilla says. So these families have endured a shattering tragedy. It ought to be a shock to us all as a nation and as a people. It ought to obsess us. It ought to lead to some sort of transformation. That's what happened in other countries when they experienced similar tragedies. In the United Kingdom, in Australia, when just a single mass shooting occurred in those countries, they understood that there was nothing ordinary about this kind of carnage. They endured great heartbreak, but they also mobilized and they changed, and mass shootings became a great rarity. And yet, here in the United States, after the round-of-clock coverage on cable news, after the heartbreaking interviews with families, after all the speeches and all the punditry and all the commentary, nothing happens. Alongside the anguish of these American families, alongside the accumulated outrage so many of us feel, sometimes I fear there's a creeping resignation that these tragedies are just somehow the way it is, that this is somehow the new normal. We can't accept this. As Americans bound in grief and love, we must insist here today there is nothing normal about innocent men and women being gunned down where they work. There is nothing normal about our children being gunned down in their classrooms. There is nothing normal about children dying in our streets from stray bullets. No other advanced nation endures this kind of violence -- none. Here in America, the murder rate is three times what it is in other developed nations. The murder rate with guns is ten times what it is in other developed nations. And there is nothing inevitable about it. It comes about because of decisions we make or fail to make. And it falls upon us to make it different. Sometimes it takes an unexpected voice to break through, to help remind us what we know to be true. And we heard one of those voices last week. Dr. Janis Orlowski's team at Medstar Washington Hospital Center treated the wounded. And in the midst of one of her briefings, she spoke with heartbreaking honesty as somebody who sees, daily and nightly, the awful carnage of so much violence. We are a great country, she said, but \"there's something wrong.\" All these shootings, all these victims, she said, \"this is not America.\" \"It is a challenge to all of us,\" she said, and \"we have to work together to get rid of this.\" And that's the wisdom we should be taking away from this tragedy and so many others -- not accepting these shootings as inevitable, but asking what can we do to prevent them from happening again and again and again. I've said before, we cannot stop every act of senseless violence. We cannot know every evil that lurks in troubled minds. But if we can prevent even one tragedy like this, save even one life, spare other families what these families are going through, surely we've got an obligation to try. It's true that each of the tragedies I've mentioned is different. And in this case, it's clear we need to do a better job of securing our military facilities and deciding who gets access to them. And as Commander in Chief, I have ordered a review of procedures up and down the chain, and I know that Secretary Hagel is moving aggressively on that. As a society, it's clear we've got to do a better job of ensuring that those who need mental health care actually get it, and that in those efforts we don't stigmatize those who need help. Those things are clear, and we've got to move to address them. But we Americans are not an inherently more violent people than folks in other countries. We're not inherently more prone to mental health problems. The main difference that sets our nation apart, what makes us so susceptible to so many mass shootings, is that we don't do enough -- we don't take the basic, common-sense actions to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people. What's different in America is it's easy to get your hands on gun -- and a lot of us know this. But the politics are difficult, as we saw again this spring. And that's sometimes where the resignation comes from -- the sense that our politics are frozen and that nothing will change. Well, I cannot accept that. I do not accept that we cannot find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions, including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners, while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis. And it may not happen tomorrow and it may not happen next week, it may not happen next month -- but it will happen. Because it's the change that we need, and it's a change overwhelmingly supported by the majority of Americans. By now, though, it should be clear that the change we need will not come from Washington, even when tragedy strikes Washington. Change will come the only way it ever has come, and that's from the American people. So the question now is not whether, as Americans, we care in moments of tragedy. Clearly, we care. Our hearts are broken -- again. And we care so deeply about these families. But the question is, do we care enough? Do we care enough to keep standing up for the country that we know is possible, even if it's hard, and even if it's politically uncomfortable? Do we care enough to sustain the passion and the pressure to make our communities safer and our country safer? Do we care enough to do everything we can to spare other families the pain that is felt here today?", "filename": "22September2013NavyYardShootingMemorialSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Not a single Jew who came there was turned away, or turned in.

And, I mean, I've said this before. I get this question about once every month or so, and I don't know what to tell you, other than the fact that, like folks who go to AA, once you've gone down this path, then it's something you continually struggle with, which is precisely why the legislation we signed was so important, because what we don't want is kids going down that path in the first place.

I get letters every day from people who say, you know, I appreciate that you put out this mortgage program, but the bank is still not letting me modify my mortgage and I'm about to lose my home.

And we walked the rows where the barracks once stood, where so many left this Earth -- including Elies father, Shlomo.  We stopped at an old photo -- men and boys lying in their wooden bunks, barely more than skeletons.  And if you look closely, you can see a 16-year old boy, looking right at the camera, right into your eyes.  You can see Elie. And at the end of our visit that day, Elie spoke of his father.  \"I thought one day I will come back and speak to him,\" he said, \"of times in which memory has become a sacred duty of all people of goodwill.\"  Elie, you've devoted your life to upholding that sacred duty.  Youve challenged us all -- as individuals, and as nations -- to do the same, with the power of your example, the eloquence of your words, as you did again just now.  And so to you and Marion, we are extraordinarily grateful. To Sara, to Tom Bernstein, to Josh Bolten, members of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, and everyone who sustains this living memorial -- thank you for welcoming us here today.  To the members of Congress, members of the diplomatic corps, including Ambassador Michael Oren of Israel, we are glad to be with you. And most of all, we are honored to be in the presence of men and women whose lives are a testament to the endurance and the strength of the human spirit -- the inspiring survivors.  It is a privilege to be with you, on a very personal level.  As Ive told some of you before, I grew up hearing stories about my great uncle -- a soldier in the 89th Infantry Division who was stunned and shaken by what he saw when he helped to liberate Ordruf, part of Buchenwald.   And Ill never forget what I saw at Buchenwald, where so many perished with the words of Shma Yisraeil on their lips. Ive stood with survivors, in the old Warsaw ghettos, where a monument honors heroes who said we will not go quietly; we will stand up, we will fight back.  And Ive walked those sacred grounds at Yad Vashem, with its lesson for all nations -- the Shoah cannot be denied. During my visit to Yad Vashem I was given a gift, inscribed with those words from the Book of Joel:  \"Has the like of this happened in your days or in the days of your fathers?", "filename": "23April2012U.S.HolocaustMemorialMuseumAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Its remarkable -- as we walked through this exhibit, Elie and I were talking as we looked at the unhappy record of the State Department and so many officials here in the United States during those years.  And he asked, \"What would you do?\"  But what you all understand is you don't just count on officials, you don't just count on governments.  You count on people -- and mobilizing their consciences. And finally, \"never again\" is a challenge to nations.  Its a bitter truth -- too often, the world has failed to prevent the killing of innocents on a massive scale.  And we are haunted by the atrocities that we did not stop and the lives we did not save. Three years ago today, I joined many of you for a ceremony of remembrance at the U.S. Capitol.  And I said that we had to do \"everything we can to prevent and end atrocities.\"  And so I want to report back to some of you today to let you know that as President Ive done my utmost to back up those words with deeds.  Last year, in the first-ever presidential directive on this challenge, I made it clear that \"preventing mass atrocities and genocide is a core national security interest and a core moral responsibility of the United States of America.\" That does not mean that we intervene militarily every time theres an injustice in the world.  We cannot and should not.  It does mean we possess many tools -- diplomatic and political, and economic and financial, and intelligence and law enforcement and our moral suasion -- and using these tools over the past three years, I believe -- I know -- that we have saved countless lives. When the referendum in South Sudan was in doubt, it threatened to reignite a conflict that had killed millions.  But with determined diplomacy, including by some people in this room, South Sudan became the worlds newest nation.  And our diplomacy continues, because in Darfur, in Abyei, in Southern Kordofan and the Blue Nile, the killing of innocents must come to an end.  The Presidents of Sudan and South Sudan must have the courage to negotiate -- because the people of Sudan and South Sudan deserve peace.  That is work that we have done, and it has saved lives. When the incumbent in Cte DIvoire lost an election but refused to give it up -- give up power, it threatened to unleash untold ethnic and religious killings.  But with regional and international diplomacy, and U.N. peacekeepers who stood their ground and protected civilians, the former leader is now in The Hague, and Cte DIvoire is governed by its rightful leader -- and lives were saved. When the Libyan people demanded their rights and Muammar Qaddafis forces bore down on Benghazi, a city of 700,000, and threatened to hunt down its people like rats, we forged with allies and partners a coalition that stopped his troops in their tracks.  And today, the Libyan people are forging their own future, and the world can take pride in the innocent lives that we saved. And when the Lords Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony continued its atrocities in Central Africa, I ordered a small number of American advisors to help Uganda and its neighbors pursue the LRA.  And when I made that announcement, I directed my National Security Council to review our progress after 150 days.  We have done so, and today I can announce that our advisors will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice, and to save lives.  It is part of our regional strategy to end the scourge that is the LRA, and help realize a future where no African child is stolen from their family and no girl is raped and no boy is turned into a child soldier. Weve stepped up our efforts in other ways.  Were doing more to protect women and girls from the horror of wartime sexual violence.  With the arrest of fugitives like Ratko Mladic, charged with ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, the world sent a message to war criminals everywhere:  We will not relent in bringing you to justice.  Be on notice.  And for the first time, we explicitly barred entry into the United States of those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Now were doing something more.  Were making sure that the United States government has the structures, the mechanisms to better prevent and respond to mass atrocities.  So I created the first-ever White House position dedicated to this task.  Its why I created a new Atrocities Prevention Board, to bring together senior officials from across our government to focus on this critical mission.  This is not an afterthought.  This is not a sideline in our foreign policy.  The board will convene for the first time today, at the White House.  And Im pleased that one of its first acts will be to meet with some of your organizations -- citizens and activists who are partners in this work, who have been carrying this torch. Going forward, well strengthen our tools across the board, and we'll create new ones.  The intelligence community will prepare, for example, the first-ever National Intelligence Estimate on the risk of mass atrocities and genocide.  We're going to institutionalize the focus on this issue.  Across government, \"alert channels\" will ensure that information about unfolding crises -- and dissenting opinions -- quickly reach decision-makers, including me. Our Treasury Department will work to more quickly deploy its financial tools to block the flow of money to abusive regimes.  Our military will take additional steps to incorporate the prevention of atrocities into its doctrine and its planning.  And the State Department will increase its ability to surge our diplomats and experts in a crisis.  USAID will invite people and high-tech companies to help create new technologies to quickly expose violations of human rights.  And well work with other nations so the burden is better shared -- because this is a global responsibility. In short, we need to be doing everything we can to prevent and respond to these kinds of atrocities -- because national sovereignty is never a license to slaughter your people. We recognize that, even as we do all we can, we cannot control every event.  And when innocents suffer, it tears at our conscience.  Elie alluded to what we feel as we see the Syrian people subjected to unspeakable violence, simply for demanding their universal rights.  And we have to do everything we can.  And as we do, we have to remember that despite all the tanks and all the snipers, all the torture and brutality unleashed against them, the Syrian people still brave the streets.  They still demand to be heard.  They still seek their dignity.  The Syrian people have not given up, which is why we cannot give up. And so with allies and partners, we will keep increasing the pressure, with a diplomatic effort to further isolate Assad and his regime, so that those who stick with Assad know that they are making a losing bet.  Well keep increasing sanctions to cut off the regime from the money it needs to survive.  Well sustain a legal effort to document atrocities so killers face justice, and a humanitarian effort to get relief and medicine to the Syrian people.  And well keep working with the \"Friends of Syria\" to increase support for the Syrian opposition as it grows stronger. Indeed, today were taking another step.  Ive signed an executive order that authorizes new sanctions against the Syrian government and Iran and those that abet them for using technologies to monitor and track and target citizens for violence.  These technologies should not empower -- these technologies should be in place to empower citizens, not to repress them.  And its one more step that we can take toward the day that we know will come -- the end of the Assad regime that has brutalized the Syrian people -- and allow the Syrian people to chart their own destiny. Even with all the efforts Ive described today, even with everything that hopefully we have learned, even with the incredible power of museums like this one, even with everything that we do to try to teach our children about our own responsibilities, we know that our work will never be done. There will be conflicts that are not easily resolved.  There will be senseless deaths that arent prevented.  There will be stories of pain and hardship that test our hopes and try our conscience.  And in such moments it can be hard to imagine a more just world. It can be tempting to throw up our hands and resign ourselves to mans endless capacity for cruelty.  Its tempting sometimes to believe that there is nothing we can do.  And all of us have those doubts.  All of us have those moments -- perhaps especially those who work most ardently in these fields. So in the end, I come back to something Elie said that day we visited Buchenwald together.  Reflecting on all that he had endured, he said, \"We had the right to give up.\"  \"We had the right to give up on humanity, to give up on culture, to give up on education, to give up on the possibility of living one's life with dignity, in a world that has no place for dignity.\"  They had that right.  Imagine what they went through.  They had the right to give up.  Nobody would begrudge them that.  Whod question someone giving up in such circumstances?", "filename": "23April2012U.S.HolocaustMemorialMuseumAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you, Khadija, for that wonderful introduction. I was saying backstage I'd vote for her for something. I want to thank our U.S. Ambassador, Matthew Barzun, for all the great work that hes doing. And it is wonderful to see all of you.  I guess you all know why I came this week.  Its no secret.  Nothing was going to stop me from wishing happy birthday to Her Majesty.  And meeting George.   Who was adorable.  Michelle and I had the privilege to visit with Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh yesterday.  I cant tell you what we talked about. I can tell you that I hope I am such an engaging lunch partner when I am 90.  And Id like to thank Her Majesty for letting us use one of her Horticultural Halls for this town hall. I also just came from touring Shakespeares Globe -- which is a good way to start your Saturday morning.  Today is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeares death.  And as he once wrote, brevity is the soul of wit, so I will try to be brief on the front end so we have time for a conversation. These are some of the favorite things that I do when I travel around the world, is just have a chance to meet with young people and hear from them directly.  It's inspiring to me.  It gives me new ideas and I think underscores the degree to which young people are rising up in every continent to seize the possibilities of tomorrow. Now, whenever I get together with leaders of the United States and UK, you hear a lot about the special relationship and the shared values and interests that bind us together, and the ways that our cooperation makes the world safer and more secure, and a more just and prosperous place. And all of that is true.  We go back a pretty long way, the UK and the U.S.  Weve had our quarrels.  There was that whole tea incident and --  and the British burned my house down.   But we made up. Ultimately, we made up and ended up spilling blood on the battlefield together, side-by-side, against fascism and against tyranny, for freedom and for democracy.  And from the ashes of war, we led the charge to create the institutions and initiatives that sustain a prosperous peace -- NATO; Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan, the EU.  The joint efforts and sacrifices of previous generations of Americans and Brits are a big part of why weve known decades of relative peace and prosperity in Europe, and that, in turn, has helped to spread peace and prosperity around the world. And think about how extraordinary that is.  For more than 1,000 years, this continent was darkened by war and violence.  It was taken for granted.  It was assumed that that was the fate of man.  Now, thats not to say that your generation has had it easy.  Both here and in the United States, your generation has grown up at a time of breathtaking change.  Youve come of age through 9/11 and 7/7.  Youve had friends go off to war.  Youve seen families endure recession.  The challenges of our time -- economic inequality and climate change, terrorism and migration -- all these things are real.  And in an age of instant information, where TV and Twitter can feed us a steady stream of bad news, I know that it can sometimes seem like the order that weve created is fragile, maybe even crumbling, maybe the center cannot hold. And we see new calls for isolationism or xenophobia.  We see those who would call for rolling back the rights of people; people hunkering down in their own point of view and unwilling to engage in a democratic debate. And those impulses I think we can understand.  They are reactions to changing times and uncertainty. But when I speak to young people, I implore them and I implore you to reject those calls to pull back.  Im here to ask you to reject the notion that were gripped by forces that we cant control.  And I want you to take a longer and more optimistic view of history and the part that you can play in it. I ask you to embrace the view of one of my predecessors, President John F. Kennedy, who once said:  Our problems are man-made; therefore, they can be solved by man.  And man can be as big as he wants.1 Thats how, since 1950, the global average life expectancy has grown by 25 years.  Since 1990, weve cut extreme poverty around the world in half.  Thats how, over the past 100 years, weve come from a world where only a small fraction of women could vote to one where almost every woman can.  Thats how, since just the year 2000, weve come from a world without marriage equality to one where its a reality in nearly two dozen countries, including here and in the United States. Every few months, I speak with a new group of White House interns. Theyre roughly your age.  They come in for six months; they are assigned to various aspects of the White House.  And I often talk to them about the fact that if you could choose one moment in history in which to be born, and you didnt know ahead of time what you were to be -- you didnt know whether you were a man or a woman, what nationality, what ethnicity, what religion who your parents were, what class status you might have -- if you could choose one time in history where the chances that you led a fulfilling life were most promising, youd choose right now, this moment.  Because the world, for all of its travails, for all of its challenges, has never been healthier, better educated, wealthier, more tolerant, less violent, more attentive to the rights of all people than it is today. That doesnt mean we don't have big problems.  That's not a cause for complacency, but it is a cause for optimism.  You are standing in a moment where your capacity to shape this world is unmatched.  What an incredible privilege that is.  And youve never had better tools to make a difference -- to forge a better UK and a better Europe and a better world. So my primary message today is going to be to reject pessimism and cynicism; know that progress is possible, that our problems can be solved.  Progress requires the harder path of breaking down barriers, and building bridges, and standing up for the values of tolerance and diversity that our nations have worked and sacrificed to secure and defend. Progress is not inevitable, and it requires struggle and perseverance and discipline and faith.  But thats the story of how we won voting rights, and womens rights, and workers rights, and civil rights, and immigration rights, and gay rights.  Because those who came before us often risked their lives to give us the chance to know something better. That's what gives me so much hope about your generation.  So many of you are driven by that same impulse.  Youre a generation that has seen integration and globalization not as threats but as opportunities -- for education, and exploration, and employment, and exchange.  Youre a generation who sees differences of pluralism and diversity not as a curse, but as a great gift. Thats one of the reasons why the United States has invested in young leader initiatives around the globe -- in Africa and Latin America, Southeast Asia, and right here in the UK. So last summer, we launched Young Leaders UK.  And its grown from four students in Plymouth to more than 1,000 nationwide -- a diverse group of Brits aged 18 to 30, from government and NGOs and the private sector, including many of you here today.  I know Ambassador Barzun has held town hall workshops at more than 100 high schools, with more than 14,000 sixth formers.  Hes worked to create more of the U.S. Embassy exchange programs that have graduated alumni like Margaret Thatcher, and Gordon Brown, and Tony Blair.  Because we want you to have the tools, connections, and resources that you need to make yourselves change agents, the change that you are looking for in the world. So youre young leaders like Michael Sani, whos here today -- where is Michael?  There he is.  Michael was inspired by Americas Rock the Vote voter registration initiative, so he started his own Bite the Bullet -- Bite the Ballot -- excuse me -- initiative here in the UK.  He spent time in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he learned about our Civil Rights Movement.  And he said:  I have a new understanding of the meaning of perseverance, resilience, and delayed gratification -- about fighting for change you may not live to see, but your children will live to see. Fighting for change that you may not live to see, but that your children will live to see.  Thats what this is all about.  Thats what we are all about.  Whether in the Cold War or world war, movements for economic or social justice, efforts to combat climate change -- our best impulses has always been to leave a better world for the next generation. Maryam Ahmed is here today.  Where is Maryam?  Where are you?  Are you also behind me?  Theres Maryam up top.  Its that impulse that compels a young leader like Maryam to say, I may have grown up one of eight in a small West London house, but Im going to use the education I got at Oxford to help any child have the same opportunities that I had. And Ali Hashem is here.  Where is Ali?  Right there.  Its the same impulse thats led Ali to say, I may have fled Syria as a child, but now that Im in elective office, Im going to use my power to help other refugees like me. And Becca Bunce is here today.  Where is Becca?  Theres Becca.  Its that impulse that compels a young leader like Becca to say that, as a woman with a disability, I may have fallen down at times, but people who believed in me picked me up.  And Im going to pay it forward by fighting for people with disabilities and against violence against women, because I believe the world can be a better place. You can't help but be inspired by the stories of young people like these, both in the United States and the United Kingdom.  And think of all the good that we can do together.  Think of all the good that we have yet to accomplish.  There is not a challenge on this planet that our two countries dont take on together.  And as long as your generation nurtures that special relationship, and learns from one another, and stands together, I'm confident the future is brighter than the past, and that our best days are still ahead of us. So, with that, lets have a conversation.  All right -- you guys were ready.   Heres what we're going to do.  I am going to go boy, girl, boy, girl, to make sure that it's fair. Ill try to get in as many questions as I can.  Introduce yourself.  We have mics.  Right there.  And tell me who you are and where you're from, and then try to keep your question -- or comment relatively brief so I can get as many as possible.  All right? And we will start right here. Question:  Mr. President, my name is Keona McCarney [ph] from Belfast, Northern Ireland.  And this special relationship is felt nowhere stronger than in Northern Ireland, where America has played a really important role in our peace process.  How will your predecessor and those to come after you help to foster that? President Obama:  Well, Northern Ireland is a story of perseverance. And the fact that your generation -- how old are you now? Question:  Twenty-one. President Obama:  Twenty-one.  Your experience has been entirely different than your parents.  There are still huge problems there -- some of them political, some of them economic. But every year we have, on St. Patricks Day, folks from Ireland come.  And we had both your First Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister come.  And folks are working these issue through. And whats interesting is the degree to which the example of peacemaking in Northern Ireland is now inspiring others.  So in Colombia, Latin America right now, they're trying to undergo a peace process.  And theyve actually brought people from Northern Ireland to come and describe how do you overcome years of enmity and hatred and intolerance, and try to shape a country that is unified. You know this better than I do, but one of the things that you see in Northern Ireland that's most important is the very simple act of recognizing the humanity of those on the other side of the argument, having empathy and a sense of connection to people who are not like you.  That's taken time, but you're now seeing that.  And I think among young people who are interacting more, you're seeing that. It requires also forging a new identity that is about being from Northern Ireland as opposed to being Unionist or Sinn Fein or -- just deciding the country as a whole is more important than any particular faction or any particular flag. But this is a challenging time to do that.  Because there is so much uncertainty in the world right now, because things are changing so fast, there is a temptation to forge identities, tribal identities that give you a sense of certainty, a buffer against change.  And that's something that our young people -- we have to fight against.  Whether you're talking about Africa, or the Middle East, or Northern Ireland, or Burma, the forces that lead to the most violence and the most injustice typically spring out of people saying, I want to feel important by dividing the world into us and them.  And them threatens me, and so Ive got to make sure that my tribe strikes out first. And fighting that mentality and that impulse requires us to begin very young, with our kids.  One of the most encouraging things Ive seen in Northern Ireland is children starting to go to school together and having a sense that we're all in this together, as opposed to its us against them. But its going to take some time.  It will depend on leaders like you to make it happen, all right?  No pressure.  You're going to be fine.  You're going to do it.  All right, good question. All right, so its a gentlemans turn.  That gentleman right there.  Yes, you.  Theres nobody behind you, right there.  No, no, no.   You.  Hold on a second.  I was pointing down here, but go ahead, and Ill call on him next.  Go ahead. Question:  Hi, Im Peter from London. President Obama:  Hi, Peter. Question:  I always imagine in the future, so if your successor comes to you and she says -- I suppose it could be Bernie.   And she says, oh, hes prioritized education, health care, and defense.  These are three issues we've got, we've got in the budget.  And whats your priority and how do you think about ranking those?  And what do you think -- what would you like to see as your core priorities there? President Obama:  For the next President? Question:  And for yourself, as well.  But, yes. President Obama:  Well, one of the things that Ive learned as President is I don't always have the luxury of just choosing one or two things. Turns out that how well we do in the United States and how well the globe does depends on a lot of things. My first priority is to keep the American people safe.  Just like Im sure Prime Minister Cameron, if you asked him, what is your first priority, its keeping the United Kingdom safe.  So security is always going to be a top-of-the-list item. And the threats from ISIL and transnational terrorism are absolutely critical to address.  But how we address them is important.  And recognizing that security is not just a matter of military actions, but is a matter of the messages we send and the institutions that we build, and the diplomacy that we engage in, and the opportunities that we present to people.  That is going to be important for the next President of the United States and any global leader to recognize. I am in awe of our respective militaries, the men and women in uniform who serve their country and make such extraordinary sacrifices.  But we do them a disservice if we think that the entire burden of keeping the world safe is just placed on those who are in uniform.  That's where diplomacy comes in. You look at something like Iran where obviously the United States and Iran has had a terrible relationship since 1979; the theocracy there has engaged in all kinds of very dangerous and provocative behaviors, and they were on the path to obtain a nuclear weapon.  The hard, diplomatic work that we did, along with the UK and the EU and members of the Security Council, to forge an agreement where they are no longer on the path to get a nuclear weapon -- we never engaged in a military strike to do it, but it resulted in a much safer world. And the same is true when you think about development in sub-Saharan Africa.  An organization like Boko Haram is ideologically driven and we have to help countries like Nigeria fight against the brutality and the rape and the pillage that they engage in.  But if there are communities where children can't read or feed themselves, they are much more vulnerable to fostering these kind of demented ideologies. So I think it's not an either-or question, and it's important for young people who -- very many thoughtful young people I think instinctually are suspicious of military action because too often it's been used as a knee-jerk response to problems as opposed to part of a broader set of solutions.  But we have to do both, and we can do both. In terms of the United States right now, I would love to see a focus on early childhood education as the next step in filling out our social safety net.  We don't yet have institutions that are fully adapted to the fact that, guess what, women work and support families, and they need things like paid family leave and high-quality child care.  And we know that when we invest in children between the ages of zero and three that the outcomes in terms of them getting effective educations and having thriving lives are enormous.  We end up saving huge amounts of money from reduced crime and poverty if we just make that early investment. That's something that some countries do better than others, and we can learn from other countries along those lines. Across the board, across the developing world right now, I think we have to attend to issues of inequality.  And one of the places to start addressing these issues of inequality is making sure that every child is getting a decent education.  And a lot of our countries are not doing as well as they should on that front. All right, who is next?  The young lady right there.  You, yes, you. Question:   Hi, my name is Fatima, and my question is, do you think signing the T-TIP agreement will have a negative impact on the EU, due to the standards of regulation enforced? President Obama:  For those of you who are not aware, T-TIP, as we call it, is the trade deal that is being negotiated between the United States and the European Union.  We haven't gotten it done yet.  The truth is, is that the United States and Europe already have enormous amounts of trade, but there are still barriers that exist that prevent businesses and individuals that are providing services to each other to be able to do so seamlessly.  And if we are able to get this deal done, it's estimated that it will create millions of jobs and billions of dollars of benefits on both sides of the Atlantic. But getting trade deals done is tough, because each country has its own parochial interests and factions.  And in order to get a trade deal done, each country has to give something up.  So it's a time-consuming process.  And people, right now, are especially suspicious of trade deals because trade deals feel as if they are accelerating some of these globalizing trends that have weakened labor unions and allow for jobs to be shipped to low-wage countries.  And some of the criticism in the past of trade deals are legitimate.  Sometimes they have served the interests of large corporations and not necessarily of workers in the countries that participate in them. But we've just gone through this exercise between the United States and Asia, where we organized a large regional trade deal with 11 countries, and part of the argument that I'm making in the United States is that the answer to globalization and income inequality and lack of wage growth is not to try to pull up the drawbridge and shut off trade.  The idea is to make sure that in these trade deals we are embedding standards and values that help lift workers' rights and help lift environmental standards and help fight against things like human trafficking and child labor.  And our values should be embedded in how countries trade with each other. So, for example, Vietnam was one of the countries that is part of this Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we said to Vietnam, if you want access to our markets, we understand you have a different political system than us, but if workers have no rights and there's no possibility of organizing labor unions, we're not going to let you sell a bunch of sneakers and t-shirts into our country because by definition you're going to be undercutting the standards of living of folks in our country.  And so for the first time, the government of Vietnam has started to change its laws to recognize labor unions.  Now, they're still suppressed.  Those standards are not where they are in the United States or the UK.  But it gives us a lever by which to begin to raise standards all around the world. Now, that's less of an issue between the United States and Europe.  The main thing between the United States and Europe is trying to just break down some of the regulatory differences that make it difficult to do business back and forth.  Plus, making sure those light sockets are all matched up.   I mean, those light sockets are really irritating. Let's see.  I promised I was going to call on this gentleman back here. Yes, sir.  No, no, right here.  You keep passing by this poor guy. Question:   My name is Elijah, I'm from London.  After eight years, what would you say you want your legacy to be? President Obama:  Well, I mean, I still have a few more months. Actually, eight months and 52 days -- not that I'm counting.   I just made that up, I actually don't know.   It's roughly something like that. It's interesting, when you're in the job, you're not thinking on a day-to-day basis about your legacy -- you're thinking about how do I get done what I'm trying to get done right now.  And I don't think that I'll have a good sense of my legacy until 10 years from now, and I can look back with some perspective and get a sense of what worked and what didn't. There are things I'm proud of.  The basic principle that in a country as wealthy as the United States, every person should have access to high-quality health care that they can afford -- that's something I'm proud of, I believe in.  Saving the world economy from a Great Depression -- that was pretty good. The first time I came to London was April of 2009, and the world economy was in a free fall, in part because of the reckless behavior of folks on Wall Street, but in part because of reckless behavior of a lot of financial institutions around the globe.  For us to be able to mobilize the world community to take rapid action to stabilize the financial markets, and then in the United States to pass Wall Street reforms that make it much less likely that a crisis like that can happen again, I'm proud of that. I think on the international stage, the work that we did to get the possible nuclear weapons that Iran was developing out of Iran, and doing so without going to war is something I'm very proud of. There are things that people don't pay a lot of attention to now, but the response to the Ebola crisis -- for about three weeks, everybody was sure that everybody was going to die -- we're all going to get Ebola, we're all going to die.   And there was sort of hysteria about it.  And then everybody forgot about it.  And the reason everybody forgot about it was because we mounted what was probably one of the most effective, if not the most effective, international public health responses in the history of the world, and saved hundreds of thousands of lives. So, I'll look at a scorecard at the end.   And I'm proud about the fact that I think that I have been true to myself during this process.  I don't -- sometimes I look back at what I said when I was running for office and what I'm saying today, and they match up.  So there's, I think, a certain core integrity to what I've been trying to do.  We've had failures, and occasionally we've been blocked, but this goes back to one of the themes of my opening statement, and it's important for all the young people here to remember.  Change takes time.  And oftentimes, what you start has to then be picked up by your successors or the next generation. If you think about the gap between -- well, something I'm most familiar with -- the American Civil Rights Movement.  You had abolitionists in the 1700s who were fighting against slavery, and for a hundred years built a movement that eventually led to a civil war, and the amendments to our Constitution that ended slavery and called for equal protection under the law.  It then took another hundred years for those rights that had been enshrined in the Constitution to actually be affirmed through the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  And then it's taken another 50 years to try to make sure that those rights are realized. And they're still not fully realized.  There's still discrimination in aspects of American life, even with a black President. And, in fact, one of the dangers has been that by electing a black President, people have then said, well, there must be no problems at all. And obviously you see Ferguson and some of the issues that we've seen in the criminal justice system indicating the degree to which that was always false. So, does that mean all the work that was done along the way was worthless?  No, of course not.  But it does mean that if any of you begin to work on an issue that you care deeply about, don't be disappointed if a year out, things haven't been completely solved.  Don't give up and succumb to cynicism if, after five years, poverty has not been eradicated, and prejudice is still out there somewhere, and we havent resolved all of the steps we need to take to reverse climate change.  Its okay. Dr. King said, The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.  And it doesn't bend on its own.  It bends because we pull it in that direction.  But it requires a series of generations working and building off of what the previous one has done. And so, as President, I think about it in those ways.  I consider myself a runner, and I run my leg of the race.  But then Ive got a baton and Im passing it on to the next person.  And hopefully they're running in the right direction, as opposed to the wrong direction.  And hopefully they don't drop the baton.  And then they go and then they pass it on to somebody else.  And that's how I think you've got to think about change, generally. All right.  It is a young womans turn.  Yes, right here, in the red.  Yes, you.  No, no, that's you.  You're wearing red.  Yes. Question:   Hi, Im Louisa.  Im a climate change campaigner, and I want to thank you for your smart and creative way to try and sort of get a grip on the problem. President Obama:  Yes. Question:   And given you've been talking about the value of social movements, I was wondering which campaigns have made you change your mind while you've been in office and inspired you to do things, and where you think we need more external pressure from campaigns to create meaningful change. President Obama:  Well, that's an interesting question.  And are you talking about climate change, in particular?  Or are you talking about just generally, on a whole spectrum of issues?  That's interesting.  Its interesting because I started as a community organizer trying to pressure politicians into getting things done.  And then -- now Im on the other side, and so what has worked and what hasnt. Well, in the United States whats been remarkable is the rapidity with which the marriage equality movement changed the political landscape and hearts and minds, and resulted in actual changes in law.    Its probably been the fastest set of changes in terms of a social movement that Ive seen. On issues of LGBT rights generally, I didn't need a lot of pressure.  I came in working on ending a policy called Dont ask, Don't tell, that was preventing LGBT citizens from serving in our military openly.  We did that very systematically.  Policies in terms of those who had HIV-AIDS being able to emigrate to our country, hospital visitations -- there were a whole host of things that we were already doing. But on marriage equality, I was in favor of whats called civil unions.  My notion was initially that labeling those partnerships as marriage wasnt necessary as long as people were getting the same rights, and it would disentangle them from some of the religious connotations that marriage had in the minds of a lot of Americans.  And that's where I think -- I have to confess my children generally had an impact on me.  People I loved who were in monogamous same-sex relationships explained to me what I should have understood earlier, which is it was not simply about legal rights but about a sense of stigma, that if you're calling it something different it means that somehow it means less in the eyes of society. I believe that the manner in which the LGBT community described marriage equality as not some radical thing, but actually reached out to people who said they care about family values, and said, if you care about everything that families provide -- stability and commitment and partnership -- then this is actually a pretty conservative position to take, that you should be in favor of it.  I thought there was a lot of smarts in reaching out and building and framing the issue in a way that could bring in people who initially didnt agree with them. As a general rule, I think that what, for example, Black Lives Matter is doing now to bring attention to the problem of a criminal justice system that sometimes is not treating people fairly based on race, or reacting to shootings of individuals by police officers, has been really effective in bringing attention to problems. One of the things I caution young people about, though, that I don't think is effective is once youve highlighted an issue and brought it to peoples attention and shined a spotlight, and elected officials or people who are in a position to start bringing about change are ready to sit down with you, then you can't just keep on yelling at them.  And you can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position. The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then to start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved.  You, then, have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable, that can institutionalize the changes you seek, and to engage the other side, and occasionally to take half a loaf that will advance the gains that you seek, understanding that theres going to be more work to do, but this is what is achievable at this moment. And too often what I see is wonderful activism that highlights a problem, but then people feel so passionately and are so invested in the purity of their position that they never take that next step and say, okay, well, now I got to sit down and try to actually get something done. So the Paris agreement that we just negotiated and that a number of countries just signed yesterday on Earth Day -- the agreement we shaped is not going to, by itself, solve climate change.  The science argues that the world is going to need to do a lot more in order for us to prevent catastrophic climate change.  But my strategy from the start has been, all right, if I can get the Chinese to agree with us, as the two largest emitters, that we have to do something, and lock in China with us for the first time to take some serious steps around reducing carbon emissions, and if by getting the two largest emitters I can now leverage all the other smaller countries to also put in their own targets for emissions, and if we can set up an architecture that recognizes the need for carbon reduction and can allow people to -- allow countries to hold each other accountable, then that's a start.  And we can now start turning up the dial as our science and our understanding improves, and as technology improves, so that poor countries don't feel that they have to choose between development and carbon reductions.  And there are all kinds of compromises in that.  But it's a start. Now, there are some climate activists who, after the Paris agreement was signed, said, ah, this is not enough!  But theyre not in a conversation, apparently, with Prime Minister Modi of India, for example, whos thinking, I've still got several hundred million people without electricity, and I have some obligation to try to relieve them of their poverty and suffering, so I've got to balance those equities against the imperatives of the planet as a whole. Now, the good news is, is that most of the groups that have been involved in this process have been pretty sophisticated.  But that's a general principle that I think all of you should consider.  Make noise and occasionally you can act a little crazy to get attention, to shine a spotlight on the issue, to highlight it.  But once people who are in power and in a position to actually do something about it are prepared to meet and listen with you, do your homework; be prepared; present a plausible set of actions; and negotiate and be prepared to move the ball down the field even if it doesnt get all the way there. All right? Question:  Do I have permission to act a little bit crazy? -- President Obama:  No.  You do, but it wouldn't be fair if you just start yelling out a question and...because it's a guys turn also. All right, go ahead. Question:  Thank you, President, firstly, for all you did for the world and for mankind.  I think you made a great contribution and you inspire a lot of young people across the world.  But my question is slightly -- on East Africa -- since you said you can see an equation.  Just last week, 400 young boys died in the Mediterranean Sea in trying to seek a better life. Most left in Somalia.  And those young boys have lost their livelihoods. Since, there is international ships coming to the Somali territorial water, and those ships have been trying to protect the international ships from the piracy.  But at the same time they have been doing it, there has been a lot of proven cases that they have been dumped as waste in the Somali Sea.2  And also there is proven cases within the coast cities that children are dying with very strange diseases that theyve never seen, that these things are coming to the coast came out from the sea.3 So today I have the opportunity to ask you, while you're here for the next eight or nine months that you have, can you kindly use your leverage within the international arena to galvanize the international community to look at this issue?  And can you share some practical steps that you can take to ensure -- President Obama:  Well, I'll be honest with you.  I'm not fully familiar with some of the issues you referred to.  I'm certainly familiar with the challenges that Somalia has been going through.  And we've been working aggressively to try to help Mogadishu develop a functioning state that can protect its people and that can get an economy moving that gives young people opportunity. I'm certainly familiar with the issues of piracy and the international concerns that led to many of these ships patrolling these areas.  I'm less familiar with some of the issues that you discussed.  So what I'll do is, after this meeting, as we're shaking hands, I'll try to get some additional information from you.  One of the things I've learned as President is, although you can always fake your way through an answer, sometimes it's really good just to say, you know what, I don't know all the answers on this one.    So I'll find out more about the specifics that you're talking about. All right.  See, now since youve raised your hand and you didnt continue to act crazy, I'm going to go ahead and call on you.  Go ahead. Question:   First of all, sincerest apologies.  I guess -- President Obama:  That's okay -- Question:  -- I got overwhelmed. President Obama:  You got -- You got excited. Question:   My name is Maria Munir.  And youve been speaking a lot about how we have to become the change that we want to see.  And youve spoken about progress, about human rights, and about how we in the United States and the UK need to lead in terms of civil rights movements and LGBTQ issues.  Now I'm about to do something terrifying, which is I'm coming out to you as a non-binary person, which means that I don't fit within -- I'm getting  emotional, I'm so sorry. President Obama:  That's okay. Question:   I come from a -- I'm from Pakistani-Muslim background, which inevitably has cultural implications.  And I know that in North Carolina, recently, with the bathroom bill, and people are being forced obviously to produce birth certificates to prove their gender in order to go to a toilet.  In UK, we don't recognize non-binary people under the Equality Act, so we literally have no rights.  So if there was any discrimination, theres nothing we can do. I've been working for the last nine months with the UK Civil Service Fast Stream with Julianne Smith in order to do what I can, even though I'm still at university and running for local election at the same time.  I managed to get them to respect pronouns.  I've managed to get them to commit to gender-neutral toilets.  And these are thing I've done as a student.  And I really, really wish that yourself and David Cameron would take us seriously as transgender people.  And perhaps you could elucidate as to what you can do to go beyond what has been accepted as the LGBTQ rights movement, in including people who fit outside the social norms. President Obama:  First of all, that wasnt that crazy.  I thought you were going to ask to come up here and dance with me or something.  But, look, I'm incredibly proud of the steps it sounds like youve already taken to speak out about your own experience and then to try to create a social movement and change laws.  It sounds to me like you're on the right track. I can't speak for David Cameron, although I will say that on LGBT issues, I think David has been ahead of the curve relative to a lot of other leaders around the world and even here in the UK.  I can say from my perspective that we're taking a lot of serious steps to address these issues within the federal government. The challenge we've had is North Carolina, the law that comes up, for example, that's a state law.  And because of our system of government, I can't overturn on my own state laws unless a federal law is passed that prohibits states from doing these things.  And with the Congress I currently have, that's not likely to happen. But we're doing a lot of work administratively.  And as I said, you should feel encouraged just by virtue of the fact that I think social attitudes on this issue have changed faster than Ive seen on any other issue.  It doesn't feel fast enough for you or for those who are impacted.  And that's good -- you shouldnt feel satisfied.  You should keep pushing.  But I think the trend lines are good on this.  We're moving in the right direction -- and in part, because of a courageous act of young people like yourself.  So stick with it. All right.  Lets see.  Gentleman in the green here. Question:   Thank you much.  I agree with everything you said so far about compromise.  But in an age of polarized politics, how do you inspire people to commit to compromise and fighting for the middle ground? President Obama:  I think its a great question.  Its something that I wrestle with.  I would distinguish between compromising on principles and compromising in getting things done in the here and now.  And what I mean by that is I am uncompromising on the notion that every person, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, has a dignity and worth and have to be treated equally.  So I'm uncompromising in that basic principle. And Im also of the belief that in order to realize the principle, every child has to have true opportunity; that every child is deserving of a decent education, and decent health care, and the ability to go to college so that they can make of themselves what they will.  So that's a powerful principle in me. That drives my politics. But if Im sitting with Congress, and I have the opportunity to get half a million more kids into an early childhood education program, even though I know that that will 2 million who need it out of the program, but the alternative is none, Ill take half a million, right?  And I can look at myself in the mirror and feel good about the 500,000 that I'm helping, knowing that the next round of budget negotiations that we have, I'm going to go for another half a million, and I'm going to go for another half a million after that. So I think it's important for everyone to understand that you'd have to be principled, you have to have a North Star, a moral compass.  There should be a reason for you getting involved in social issues other than vanity, or just trying to mix and mingle and meet cute people that you're interested in -- although that's not a bad reason.   But you have to recognize that, particularly in pluralistic societies and democratic governments like we have in the United States and the UK, there are people who disagree with us.  They have different perspectives.  They come from different points of view.  And they're not bad people just because they disagree with us.  They may, in fact, assert that they've got similar principles to ours, but they just disagree with us on the means to vindicate those principles. And you are absolutely right that we are in this age now -- partly because of what's happened with our media, in which people from different political parties, different political orientations can spend the bulk of their day only talking to, and listening to, and hearing the perspectives of people who already agree with them. I know less about the UK media, but in the United States, it used to be we had three television stations.  And people might complain about the dominance of these three television stations, but there was one virtue to them, which was everybody was kind of watching the same thing and had the same understanding of what the facts were on any given issue.  And today, you have 500 television stations, and the Internet will give you a thousand different sources of information.  And so what's increasingly happening in the United States is, is that if you're a conservative, then you're watching Fox News or you're reading a conservative blogpost.  If you're a liberal, then you're reading the Huffington Post or reading The New York Times.  And there's this massive divergence that's taking place in terms of just what the agreed-upon facts and assumptions are that we're talking about.  And that does make it harder to compromise. And there have been some interesting studies that have been done showing that if you spend time with people who just agree with you on any particular issue, that you become even more extreme in your convictions because you're never contradicted and everybody just mutually reinforces their perspective. That's why I think it is so important for all the young people here to seek out people who don't agree with you.  That will teach you to compromise. It will also help you, by the way, if you decide to get married. But the most important thing is understanding that compromise does not mean surrendering what you believe, it just means that you are recognizing the truth, the fact that these other people who disagree with you or this other political party, or this other nation -- that they have dignity too, that they have worth as well, and you have to hear them and see them.  And sometimes we don't. All right, how much time do I have, by the way, people?  One more question?  I'll make it two.  I'll make it two.  Let's see. The young lady right there.  Go ahead. Question:   Good morning, Mr. President. President Obama:  Good morning. Question:   I'm losing my voice, so I apologize. President Obama:  That's okay. Question:   My name is [inaudible at: 62:33],  and my question for you is, what leadership skills have you found yourself relying on most during your time in office, and why? President Obama:  A thick skin -- is very helpful.  I was just talking about this, actually, with the Ambassador last night.  Where is Matthew? I think I was just talking about this.  Yes, I think we were just talking about this. Two things I'm pretty good at -- well, let me say this.  One of the things that happens as you get older is you are, hopefully, more aware of and honest with yourself about what your strengths are and what your weaknesses are.  I could list my weaknesses, but you asked me about the things I've found useful, so I'll skip over that. Two things I'm pretty good at -- one is attracting talent.  And anybody who wants to be a leader, I would advise you to spend a lot of time thinking about how am I helping other people do great things.  Because, as President of the United States, I am dealing with so many issues and I can't be expert on everything, and I can't be everywhere.  And the one thing I can do is assemble a team of people who are really good and really smart and really committed, and care about their mission, and have integrity, and then give them the tools, or get rid of the barriers, or help coach them so that they can do a great job. And I think leaders who think that their primary job is to make everybody do exactly what they want, as opposed to helping to organize really talented people to collectively go to where we need to go typically stumble.  You should be predisposed to other people's power -- how can I make the people around me do great things.  If they do, then, by definition, I'll succeed, because that's my job, is to get this team moving in the right direction. So thats one.  The second thing, I'm pretty good at setting a course, a general direction, and being able to hopefully unify that team around that general direction.  Oftentimes I have to rely on other people to implement and execute to get there, but setting a direction requires also listening to what is it that's important to people. And the third thing is synthesizing -- I think it's very useful as a leader to be able to -- particularly on complex issues -- to sit around a table and hear a lot of different points of view, and be able to get to what's the nub of the issue, what's the heart of the problem, what's the essential conflict that we're trying to resolve, and get everybody to see the problem the same -- see what the problem is. Because I see a lot of organizations, they spend a lot of time doing a lot of work, but they're working on the wrong thing or they're distracted from the essential issue.  Somebody once said, it's more important to do the right thing than to do things right.  And what they meant was you can hack away and build this amazing path through the jungle, but if you're headed in the wrong direction then it's a waste of time.  So you've got to make sure that people understand what it is that we're trying to solve. Yeah, that's enough. I've got time for one more.  All right.  The Sikh gentleman.  Yes. Question:   Hello.  So my issue -- my question is related to an issue which minorities face in the USA.  We see many times Sikhs being discriminated against, as Muslims, and even if we were Muslims, that still doesn't give the right for anyone to be Islamophobic to us.  So my question is, why isn't a firm stand being taken on issues such as ample security, where there's a lot of issues with TSA?  Since your neighbors in Canada -- Justin Trudeau, he recently said that he's going to apologize for an issue which happened 102 years ago, and he has recently become Prime Minister, so why is it that he is taking a firm stand on an issue which happened so long ago, whereas countries such as the USA aren't taking a stand against discrimination when it is 2016? President Obama:  Hold on.  Before everybody starts applauding that question -- let's make sure that we're on the same wavelength in terms of facts.  I have taken an adamant stand against making sure that we're not racially profiling in airports.  And it is explicit TSA policy not to racially profile. Now, does that mean that out of the hundreds of airports and thousands of TSA officials that there has not been times where a Sikh is going through the airport and somebody targets them for a secondary screening because of what they look like?", "filename": "23April2016YoungLeadersTownHallintheUnitedKingdom.txt"}, {"question": "Second, well accelerate the periodic reviews of remaining detainees to determine whether their continued detention is necessary.  Our review board, which includes representatives from across government, will continue to look at all relevant information, including current intelligence.  And if certain detainees no longer pose a continuing significant threat, they may be eligible for transfer to another country as well. Number three, well continue to use all legal tools to deal with the remaining detainees still held under law of war detention.  Currently, 10 detainees are in some stage of the military commissions process -- a process that we worked hard to reform in my first year in office with bipartisan support from Congress.  But I have to say, with respect to these commissions, they are very costly, they have resulted in years of litigation without a resolution.  Were therefore outlining additional changes to improve these commissions, which would require congressional action, and we will be consulting with them in the near future on that issue.   I also want to point out that, in contrast to the commission process, our Article 3 federal courts have proven to have an outstanding record of convicting some of the most hardened terrorists.  These prosecutions allow for the gathering of intelligence against terrorist groups.  It proves that we can both prosecute terrorists and protect the American people.  So think about it -- terrorists like Richard Reid, the shoe bomber; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit; Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Square; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who bombed the Boston Marathon -- they were all convicted in our Article III courts and are now behind bars, here in the United States. So we can capture terrorists, protect the American people, and when done right, we can try them and put them in our maximum security prisons, and it works just fine.  And in this sense, the plan were putting forward today isnt just about closing the facility at Guantanamo.  Its not just about dealing with the current group of detainees, which is a complex piece of business because of the manner in which they were originally apprehended and what happened.  This is about closing a chapter in our history.  It reflects the lessons that weve learned since 9/11 --lessons that need to guide our nation going forward.   So even as we use military commissions to close out the cases of some current detainees -- which, given the unique circumstances of their cases make it difficult for them to be tried in Article III courts -- this type of use of military commissions should not set a precedent for the future.  As they have been in past wars, military commissions will continue to be an option when individuals are detained during battle.  But our preferred option, the most effective option for dealing with individuals detained outside military theaters, must be our strong, proven federal courts. Fourth, and finally, were going to work with Congress to find a secure location in the United States to hold remaining detainees.  These are detainees who are subject to military commissions, but it also includes those who cannot yet be transferred to other countries or who weve determined must continue to be detained because they pose a continuing significant threat to the United States.   We are not identifying a specific facility today in this plan.  We are outlining what options look like.  As Congress has imposed restrictions that currently prevent the transfer of detainees to the United States, we recognize that this is going to be a challenge.  And were going to keep making the case to Congress that we can do this is a responsible and secure way, taking into account the lessons and great record of our maximum-security prisons. And let me point out, the plan were submitting today is not only the right thing to do for our security, it will also save money.  The Defense Department estimates that this plan, compared to keeping Guantanamo open, would lower costs by up to 85 million dollars a year.  Over 10 years, it would generate savings of more than 300 million dollars.  Over 20 years, the savings would be up to 1.7 billion dollars.  In other words, we can ensure our security, uphold our highest values around the world, and save American taxpayers a lot of money in the process.  So in closing, I want to say I am very clear-eyed about the hurdles to finally closing Guantanamo.  The politics of this are tough.  I think a lot of the American public are worried about terrorism, and in their mind the notion of having terrorists held in the United States rather than in some distant place can be scary.  But part of my message to the American people here is were already holding a bunch of really dangerous terrorists here in the United States because we threw the book at them.  And there have been no incidents.  Weve managed it just fine.   And in Congress, I recognize, in part because of some of the fears of the public that have been fanned oftentimes by misinformation, there continues to be a fair amount of opposition to doing closing Guantanamo.  If it were easy, it would have happened years ago -- as I wanted, as I have been working to try to get done.  But there remains bipartisan support for closing it.  And given the stakes involved for our security, this plan deserves a fair hearing.  Even in an election year, we should be able to have an open, honest, good-faith dialogue about how to best ensure our national security.  And the fact that Im no longer running, Joe is no longer running, were not on the ballot -- it gives us the capacity to not have to worry about the politics.   Let us do what is right for America.  Let us go ahead and close this chapter, and do it right, do it carefully, do it in a way that makes sure were safe, but gives the next President and, more importantly, future generations, the ability to apply the lessons weve learned in the fight against terrorism and doing it in a way that doesnt raise some of the problems that Guantanamo has raised. I really think theres an opportunity here for progress.  I believe weve got an obligation to try.  President Bush said he wanted to close Guantanamo despite everything that he had invested in it.  I give him credit for that.  There was an honest assessment on his part about what needed to happen.  But he didnt get it done and it was passed to me.  Ive been working for seven years now to get this thing closed.  As President, I have spent countless hours dealing with this -- I do not exaggerate about that.  Our closest allies have raised it with me continually.  They often raise specific cases of detainees repeatedly.   I dont want to pass this problem on to the next President, whoever it is.  And if, as a nation, we dont deal with this now, when will we deal with it?  Are we going to let this linger on for another 15 years, another 20 years, another 30 years?", "filename": "23February2016AddressonClosingGuantanamoBayDetentionFacility.txt"}, {"question": "Please, please, everybody have a seat. Commander DeNoyer, thank you for your introduction, and your service in Vietnam and on behalf of America's veterans. I want to thank your executive director, Bob Wallace; your next commander, who I look forward to working with, John Hamilton.  And to Gwen Rankin, Leanne Lemley, and the entire Ladies Auxiliary, thank you for your patriotic service to America. I stand before you as our hearts still ache over the tragedy in Aurora, Colorado.  Yesterday I was in Aurora, with families whose loss is hard to imagine -- with the wounded, who are fighting to recover; with a community and a military base in the midst of their grief. And they told me of the loved ones they lost. And here today, it's fitting to recall those who wore our nation's uniform: Staff Sergeant Jesse Childress -- an Air Force reservist, 29 years old, a cyber specialist who loved sports, the kind of guy, said a friend, who'd help anybody. Petty Officer Third Class John Larimer -- 27 years old, who, like his father and grandfather before him, joined the Navy, and who is remembered as an outstanding shipmate. Rebecca Wingo -- 32 years old, a veteran of the Air Force, fluent in Chinese, who served as a translator; a mother, whose life will be an inspiration to her two little girls. And Jonathan Blunk -- from Reno, just 26 years old, but a veteran of three Navy tours, whose family and friends will always know that in that theater he gave his own life to save another. These young patriots were willing to serve in faraway lands, yet they were taken from us here at home.  And yesterday I conveyed to their families a message on behalf of all Americans: We honor your loved ones. We salute their service. And as you summon the strength to carry on and keep bright their legacy, we stand with you as one united American family. Veterans of Foreign Wars, in you I see the same shining values, the virtues that make America great. When our harbor was bombed and fascism was on the march, when the fighting raged in Korea and Vietnam, when our country was attacked on that clear September morning, when our forces were sent to Iraq -- you answered your countrys call. Because you know what Americans must always remember -- our nation only endures because there are patriots who protect it. In the crucible of battle, you were tested in ways the rest of us will never know. You carry in your hearts the memory of the comrades you lost.  For you understand that we must honor our fallen heroes not just on Memorial Day, but all days. And when an American goes missing, or is taken prisoner, we must do everything in our power to bring them home. Even after you took off the uniform, you never stopped serving. You took care of each other -- fighting for the benefits and care you had earned. And youve taken care of the generations that followed, including our newest veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. On behalf of all our men and women in uniform, and on behalf of the American people, I want to thank you, VFW. Thank you for your outstanding work. Of course, some among you -- our Vietnam veterans -- didnt always receive that thanks, at least not on time. This past Memorial Day, I joined some of you at The Wall to begin the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War. And it was another chance to say what should have been said all along: You did your duty, and you made us proud. And as this 50th anniversary continues, Id ask all our Vietnam vets to stand, or raise your hand, as we say: Thank you and welcome home. Every generation among you served to keep us strong and free. And it falls to us, those that follow, to preserve what you won. Four years ago, I stood before you at a time of great challenge for our nation. We were engaged in two wars. Al Qaeda was entrenched in their safe havens in Pakistan. Many of our alliances were frayed. Our standing in the world had suffered. We were in the worst recession of our lifetimes.  Around the world, some questioned whether the United States still had the capacity to lead. So, four years ago, I made you a promise. I pledged to take the fight to our enemies, and renew our leadership in the world. As President, thats what Ive done. And as you reflect on recent years, as we look ahead to the challenges we face as a nation and the leadership thats required, you dont just have my words, you have my deeds. You have my track record. You have the promises Ive made and the promises that Ive kept. I pledged to end the war in Iraq honorably, and thats what weve done. After I took office, we removed nearly 150,000 U.S. troops from Iraq. And some said that bringing our troops home last year was a mistake. They would have kept tens of thousands of our forces in Iraq -- indefinitely, without a clear mission. Well, when youre Commander-in-Chief, you owe the troops a plan, you owe the country a plan -- and that includes recognizing not just when to begin wars, but also how to end them. So we brought our troops home responsibly. They left with their heads held high, knowing they gave Iraqis a chance to forge their own future. And today, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq, and we are proud of all the Americans who served there. I pledged to make it a priority to take out the terrorists who had attacked us on 9/11.  And as a candidate, I said that if we had Osama bin Laden in our sights, we would act to keep America safe -- even if it meant going into Pakistan. Some of you remember, at the time, that comment drew quite a bit of criticism. But since I took office, weve worked with our allies and our partners to take out more top al Qaeda leaders than any time since 9/11. And thanks to the courage and the skill of our forces, Osama bin Laden will never threaten America again, and al Qaeda is on the road to defeat. I pledged to finish the job in Afghanistan. After years of drift, we had to break the momentum of the Taliban, and build up the capacity and the capability of Afghans.  And so, working with our commanders, we came up with a new strategy, and we ordered additional forces to get the job done. This is still a tough fight. But thanks to the incredible services and sacrifices of our troops, we pushed the Taliban back; were training Afghan forces; weve begun the transition to Afghan lead. Again, there are those who argued against a timeline for ending this war -- or against talking about it publicly. But you know what, thats not a plan for Americas security either.  After 10 years of war, and given the progress weve made, I felt it was important that the American people -- and our men and women in uniform -- know our plan to end this war responsibly. And so by the end of this summer, more than 30,000 of our troops will have come home. Next year, Afghans will take the lead for their own security. In 2014, the transition will be complete. And even as our troops come home, well have a strong partnership with the Afghan people, and we will stay vigilant so Afghanistan is never again a source for attacks against America. Were not just ending these wars; were doing it in a way that achieves our objectives. Moreover, its allowed us to broaden our vision and begin a new era of American leadership. Were leading from Europe to the Asia Pacific, with alliances that have never been stronger. Were leading the fight against nuclear dangers. Weve applied the strongest sanctions ever on Iran and North Korea -- nations that cannot be allowed to threaten the world with nuclear weapons. Were leading on behalf of freedom -- standing with people in the Middle East and North Africa as they demand their rights; protecting the Libyan people as they rid the world of Muammar Qaddafi. Today, were also working for a transition so the Syrian people can have a better future, free of the Assad regime. And given the regimes stockpiles of chemical weapons, we will continue to make it clear to Assad and those around him that the world is watching, and that they will be held accountable by the international community and the United States, should they make the tragic mistake of using those weapons. And we will continue to work with our friends and our allies and the Syrian opposition on behalf of the day when the Syrian people have a government that respects their basic rights to live in peace and freedom and dignity. Because were leading around the world, people have a new attitude toward America. Theres more confidence in our leadership. We see it everywhere we go.  We saw it as grateful Libyans waved American flags. We see it across the globe -- when people are asked, which country do you admire the most, one nation comes out on top -- the United States of America. So this is the progress that weve made. Thanks to the extraordinary service of our men and women in uniform, were winding down a decade of war; were destroying the terrorist network that attacked us; were strengthening the alliances that extend our values. And today, every American can be proud that the United States is safer and stronger and more respected in the world. And all this allows us to fulfill another promise that I made to you four years ago -- strengthening our military. After 10 years of operations, our soldiers will now have fewer and shorter deployments, which means more time on the home front to keep their families strong; more time to heal from the wounds of war; more time to improve readiness and prepare for future threats. As President, Ive continued to make historic investments to keep our armed forces strong. And guided by our new defense strategy, we will maintain our military superiority. It will be second to none as long as I am President and well into the future.  Weve got the best-trained, best-led, best-equipped military in history. And as Commander-in-Chief I am going to keep it that way. And by the way, given all the rhetoric lately -- it is political season -- lets also set the record straight on the budget. Those big, across-the-board cuts, including defense, that Congress said would occur next year if they couldnt reach a deal to reduce the deficit? Lets understand, first of all, theres no reason that should happen, because people in Congress ought to be able to come together and agree on a plan, a balanced approach that reduces the deficit and keeps our military strong. It should be done. And there are a number of Republicans in Congress who dont want you to know that most of them voted for these cuts. Now theyre trying to wriggle out of what they agreed to. Instead of making tough choices to reduce the deficit, theyd rather protect tax cuts for some of the wealthiest Americans, even if it risks big cuts in our military.  And Ive got to tell you, VFW, I disagree. If the choice is between tax cuts that the wealthiest Americans dont need and funding our troops that they definitely need to keep our country strong, I will stand with our troops every single time. So lets stop playing politics with our military. Lets get serious and reduce our deficit and keep our military strong. Lets take some of the money that were saving because were not fighting in Iraq and because were winding down in Afghanistan -- use half that money to pay down our deficit; lets use half of it to do some nation-building here in the United States of America. Lets keep taking care of our extraordinary military families. For the first time ever, weve made military families and veterans a top priority not just at DOD, not just at the VA, but across the government. As Richard mentioned, this has been a mission for my wife, Michelle, and Vice President Joe Bidens wife, Dr. Jill Biden. Today, more people across America in every segment of society are Joining Forces to give our military families the respect and the support that they deserve. And theres another way we can honor those who serve. It may no longer be a crime for con artists to pass themselves off as heroes, but one thing is certain -- it is contemptible. So this week, we will launch a new website, a living memorial, so the American people can see whos been awarded our nations highest honors. Because no American hero should ever have their valor stolen. This leads me to another promise I made four years ago -- upholding Americas sacred trust with our veterans. I promised to strengthen the VA, and that promise has been kept. In my first year, we achieved the largest percentage increase in the VA budget in 30 years. And were going to keep making historic investments in our veterans. When Richard came to the Oval Office, we talked about what those automatic budget cuts -- sequestration -- could mean for the VA. So my Administration has made it clear: Your veterans benefits are exempt from sequestration. They are exempt. And because advance appropriations is now the law of the land, veterans' health care is protected from the budget battles in Washington. I promised you that Id stand up for veterans' health care. As long as Im President, I will not allow VA health care to be turned into a voucher system, subject to the whims of the insurance market. Some have argued for this plan. I could not disagree more. You dont need vouchers, you need the VA health care that you have earned and that you depend on. So weve made dramatic investments to help care for our veterans. For our Vietnam veterans, we declared that more illnesses are now presumed connected to your exposure to Agent Orange. As a result of our decision, Vietnam-era vets and your families received nearly 4 billion dollars in disability pay. You needed it; you fought for it. We heard you and we got it done. Weve added mobile clinics for our rural veterans; more tailored care for our women veterans; unprecedented support for veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury. All tolled, weve made VA health care available to nearly 800,000 veterans who didnt have it before. And were now supporting caregivers and families with the skills and the stipends to help care for the veterans that they love. Of course, more veterans in the system means more claims. So weve hired thousands of claims processors. Were investing in paperless systems. To their credit, the dedicated folks at the VA are now completing one million claims a year. But theres been a tidal wave of new claims. And when I hear about veterans waiting months, or years, for your benefits -- it is unacceptable. And we are doing something about it. Were taking all those folks who processed your Agent Orange claims -- more than 1,200 experts -- and giving them a new mission:  Attack the backlog. Were prioritizing veterans with the most serious disabilities. And the VA and DOD will work harder towards a seamless transition so new veterans arent just piled on to the backlog. And we will not rest -- I will not be satisfied until we get this right. And today, Im also calling on all those who help our vets complete their claims -- state VAs, physicians and veteran groups like the VFW -- to join us. You know how this can work better, so lets get it done, together. Were also focused on the urgent needs of our veterans with PTSD. Weve poured tremendous resources into this fight -- thousands of more counselors and more clinicians, more care and more treatment. And we've made it easier for veterans with PTSD to qualify for VA benefits. But after a decade of war, its now an epidemic.  Were losing more troops to suicide -- one every single day -- than we are in combat. According to some estimates, about 18 veterans are taking their lives each day -- more every year than all the troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan combined.  That's a tragedy. It's heartbreaking. It should not be happening in the United States of America. So when I hear about servicemembers and veterans who had the courage to seek help but didnt get it, who died waiting, that's an outrage. And Ive told Secretary Panetta, Chairman Dempsey and Secretary Shinseki weve got to do better. This has to be all hands on deck. So our message to everyone whos ever worn the uniform -- if youre hurting, its not a sign of weakness to seek help, its a sign of strength. And when you do, well be there and do more to help -- including more counselors and clinicians to help you heal. We need to end this tragedy, VFW. And we're going to work together to make it happen. So, too with our campaign to end homelessness among our veterans. Weve now helped to bring tens of thousands of veterans off the streets and into permanent housing. This has to be a core mission, because every veteran who has fought for America ought to have a home in America. And this brings me to the last promise I want to discuss with you. Four years ago, I said that Id do everything I could to help our veterans realize the American Dream, to enlist you in building a stronger America. After all, our veterans have the skills that America needs. So today, our economy is growing and creating jobs, but its still too hard for too many folks to find work, especially our younger veterans, our veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. And with a million more troops rejoining civilian life in the years ahead -- and looking for work -- weve got to step up our game, at every stage of their careers. So today, Im announcing a major overhaul of our transition assistance program. Were going to set up a kind of \"reverse boot camp\" for our departing servicemembers. Starting this year, theyll get more personalized assistance as they plan their careers. Well provide the training they need to find that job, or pursue that education, or start that business. And just as theyve maintained their military readiness, well have new standards of \"career readiness.\" In addition, by making the Post-9/11 GI Bill a priority, weve helped more than 800,000 veterans and their families pursue their education. And Ive issued an executive order to help put a stop to schools that are ripping off our veterans. Ive directed the federal government to step up on jobs. Since I took office, weve hired more than 200,000 veterans into the federal government. We made it a priority. And were keeping track -- every agency, every department: What are you doing for our veterans?", "filename": "23July2012Speechtothe113thVeteransofForeignWarsConvention.txt"}, {"question": "But its critical that we work together.  And that's one of the reasons why the U.S. has started a new chapter with our relationship with Cuba.  I was honored to be the first U.S. President to visit Cuba in almost 90 years.  And we still have differences with the Cuban government, but what I said to President Castro is we can't be imprisoned by the past.  When something doesn't work for 50 years, we have to try something new.  And I believe that engagement and dialogue is more powerful than isolation, and that the changes that we're making can improve the lives of the Cuban people. And all of the people of the Americas deserve the right to speak and gather freely, and access the worlds information, and participate in forums like this.  And so we hope that that will happen in Cuba.  We hope that will happen everywhere in the world.  But ultimately, its going to be up to the Cuban people, just like its up to sovereign peoples everywhere to be able to find their own voice and create democracy and freedom.  We can be partners in that, and we can help. And this new beginning is going to be good, I think, for the entire hemisphere.  Part of my goal is to move past the old debates that have defined this region, move forward in a way that benefits your generation.  And unlike any other time in history, the technology at your disposal means that you don't have to settle for the world as it is; you can create the world as you want it to be.  You already have the freedom to build a world in powerful and disruptive ways. That's why we're going to spend a lot of time in the coming months in building more vibrant connections between young people. Five years ago I started an initiative called 100,000 Strong in the Americas.  And by the end of this decade, we want 100,000 U.S. students studying in the Americas, and we want 100,000 students from the Americas studying in the United States. And today Im proud to announce that that effort is growing here in Argentina.  Partners like INET and CAF Development Bank in Latin America have committed to increase student exchanges between our technical colleges.  And I want to thank President Macri for committing to a thousand new exchanges. And finally, last year I launched what we call the Young Leaders of the America Initiative.  And we're seeking out the most innovative young entrepreneurs and civil society leaders, and giving them a chance to earn the training and the connections and the capital that you need to make a difference.  So this year Ill welcome the first full class of fellows to Washington.  We're going to help them expand their commercial and social ventures by embedding them in U.S. businesses and incubators and nonprofits and universities.  We're going to give U.S. participants the chance to continue their collaboration with you back in your home countries. And that's how we want to empower all young people.  That's how we want to empower young women like Celeste.  Its how we create a future where climate researchers in the Amazon collaborate with scientists in Alaska; where an idea in Buenos Aires can develop with an incubator in Boston.  Its how we can make sure that we create a future where any young person can choose a path that opens his or her opportunities beyond their neighborhood into the wider world. Its where a young person can learn skills in the state of West Virginia in the United States, and put them to work right here in Argentina.  So, Gino Tubaro, whos here today -- wheres Gino?  Somewhere.  There we go.  All right, Gino. So Gino is a great example.  He was tinkering with 3D printing as a teenager when, through the U.S. Embassy, he participated in a National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.  Then he learned about the latest 3D printing technology.  When he came home to Argentina, he co-founded a company that used these new skills to work.  He received a request from a woman looking for a prosthetic hand for her young son, Felipe.  And typically, those hands can costs tens of thousands of American dollars.  Gino printed a new hand for Felipe for far less.  Just a few weeks later, for the first time, Felipe could ride a bike, go fishing, do many of the things that normal children do.  And since then, more than 1,000 Argentinians have signed up for Ginos help. So thats whats possible when we work together.  Thats whats possible when we invest in young people like all of you.  So I am very proud to be here.  Im excited for your questions.  Im excited for our conversation.  As you heard, my Spanish is not as good as it should be.  But we have a translator here so you can ask questions in English or in Spanish, and I will answer them as best I can.  And we have about an hour.  Preguntenme.  Lets go.  All right?", "filename": "23March2016YoungLeadersTownHallinArgentina.txt"}, {"question": "Question:  Mr. President, I wanted to ask you the following question.  We live in a world where cultures often clash instead of coexisting peacefully; where some believe their very survival depends on the eradication of others; where intolerance and violence have become a currency; and people are forced to abandon everything and flee their homes, a drama which I believe will characterize much of this centurys history. My question is this:  Do you think all of the different human cultures will eventually unify or converge on a unique and universal culture, something like -- perhaps something akin to the United Federation of Planets in TV series Star Trek?  I do not seek a scientific answer, just the honest opinion of a man who, as President of one of the worlds leading countries, has been given a privileged point of view on that matter. Thank you. President Obama:  That's an interesting question.  Thank you. I believe that under the surface all people are the same.  Now part of that is my own heritage and my own background.  My father was a black man from Africa.  My mother was a white woman in the United States, whose ancestors had come from England and Scotland.  My mother remarried, and then we moved to Indonesia.  So I have a half-sister who is Asian.  I have nieces who are half Chinese.  And so in my own family, Ive got the genetic strains of everybody.  And it gives me confidence -- confidence that's been reinforced as President -- that people are all essentially the same.  Similar hopes, similar dreams, similar strengths, similar weaknesses.  But we're also all bound by history and culture and habits.  And so conflicts arise, in part, because of some weaknesses in human nature.  When we feel threatened, then we like to strike out against people who are not like us.  When change is happening too quickly, and we try to hang on to those things that we think could give us a solid foundation.  And sometimes the organizing principles are around issues like race, or religion.  When there are times of scarcity, then people can turn on each other. And so I don't underestimate the very real challenges that we continue to face, and I don't think it is inevitable that the world comes together in a common culture and common understanding.  But overall, I am hopeful.  And the reason I'm hopeful is, if you look at the trajectory of history, humanity has slowly improved.  Not in a straight line -- sometimes you take two steps forward and then you take one step back. But if anybody here was asked the question, what moment in human history would you want to be born, and you didnt know ahead of time whether you were going to be born in the United States or in Namibia, you didnt know ahead of time whether you were going to be male or female, born into a wealthy family or a poor family, so all you knew was what moment in history would give you the best chance for the best life, you would choose today.  Because the world is wealthier than it's ever been.  It is better educated than it's ever been.  It is more tolerant of differences than it's ever been.  It's more connected than it's ever been.  It's healthier than it's ever been.  We live longer than we ever have.  We have better dental care than we ever have. It used to be if you had a bad tooth, that was bad.  You had a problem.  Now you go see the dentist most of the time -- in many countries around the world.  It's a small thing, but it's important.  Penicillin.  Books.  Women are treated with more respect, on average, today -- even though we have a long way to go.  People with sexual differences are treated with more respect. And even violence -- because today we see terrorism and it's painful, and we're shocked and horrified by what happens -- and yet, if you look even in the 20th century, much less if you go back to the days of the conquistadores or Genghis Khan or slavery -- but even just in the 20th century, the world is far less violent today, on average, than it was 25, 50, 100 years ago. So all of that makes me hopeful.  But as I said, it's not inevitable.  And I think one of the things that's important for bringing about further progress is that we listen to each other and we understand our differences.  I don't think it's necessary for us to all speak one language, or all have the same foods, or all have the same customs.  But I do believe that there are some universal principles that are important. I believe that the most important principle is a very simple one that is at the heart of most of the worlds great religions, which is treat somebody the same way youd want to be treated.  And if you start with that basic premise, then we will continue to make progress. But I also think that in order for us to make progress, we have to have that fellow feeling and we have to combine that with the use of our brains and reason, and our intellect.  And whats interesting now, everybody here has a phone -- everybody is looking all the time.  And in some ways, that's actually isolating people sometimes more than it's bringing people together.  And what I also notice is, because theres so much information coming in, that sometimes people just surf the surface of information as opposed to analysis and understanding and study. In America, sometimes in our politics you see sound bites -- what we call sound bites.  I don't know the translation.  But it's just the Twitter line without trying to figure out, okay, is this true or not?  What are the facts?  And when it comes to an issue like climate change, we have to have a maturity to say, okay, heres what the science tells us -- the planet is getting warmer -- and even though it's not happening right now, and it's a beautiful day outside in Buenos Aires, we have to start working now, so that 20, 30, 50, 100 years from now we still have a beautiful planet to live on. That requires not just a strong heart, but also using our heads.  And if we do those two things, then I feel confident that we'll make progress.  We'll still have problems, but that's what makes life interesting, is having a few problems. I'm going to alternate between men and women, so that we make it fair. This young lady right there, since shes standing right in the front. Question:  I'm going to have a heart attack, Mr. President. President Obama:  Oh, don't have a heart attack!  That would be bad! Question:  I'm a university professor.  I teach American political communications.  I have no answers, but I don't want to feel worse for my students.  And I want to say that you are my hero, yes. President Obama:  Well, thank you so much.  I appreciate that.  Thank you. Since you didnt have a question, I'll call on that young lady in the front, as well, just so that she -- that way I get a question.  But that was very nice.  Thank you. Question:  Thank you.  Mr. President, I'm a research scientist.  I'm very proud to have you here in my country, really.  And Im thankful, too, because I was educated in your country during my postdoc in teaching research.  So my question is related with that, with science, principally, because I feel like always art and science was like the fields where the human being have not limits.  And I was wondering if you are not fine, if you are not really just doing more than collaboration between our countries -- and this is the most important thing in this area -- why not to do a stronger collaboration between your country and mine, like this idea between others that perhaps other people have?  But I was organizing with a Professor David Kaplan in the United States, who was my mentor there, to have a representation here in Argentina from their laboratory of research. I know that there are a lot of programs of collaboration, like Georgetown, to be done like I did.  But I feel like stronger collaboration in this field must be another kind of thing -- not only to have knowledge, but to put in real -- like, for example, technologic transfer.  But I feel like science, basic science is very, very important.  When I've been there like a researcher, I feel like we can do more.  So I want to know about that. President Obama:  Good.  Well, President Macri and I spoke about this in our meeting.  I think the possibilities of collaboration between Argentina and the United States in scientific fields as well as the cultural fields -- theres a huge opportunity there. We can do much more than we've done so far.  And you're right that it's not enough just to have student exchanges.  Theres work that also has to be done together.  And the more minds we have that work on it, the sooner we'll be able to solve problems. I'll give you one specific example, and that is when it comes to diseases and medicine.  Everybody here is familiar with the emerging problem of Zika throughout the Americas.  It turns out the Zika is not a complicated virus.  And I'm actually quite optimistic that we'll be able to find a diagnostic tool and a vaccine for Zika.  But the reason in the past that it hasnt been developed was because it was predominantly in small, poorer countries in isolated areas.  There wasnt a lot of money to be made selling drugs to solve this small problem.  And so it didnt get any attention. Except now we live in this world where everybody travels, where everybody is mobile, and so theres no such thing as a disease that's just isolated in one place, because if we don't cure that disease, if we don't identify it early enough, it will sweep the world.  And oftentimes it will sweep very rapidly because theres no immunity and people aren't accustomed to it. And that's true -- we saw what happened with Ebola.  Now were seeing it with Zika.  And obviously the thing I'm most concerned about is if we end up seeing a flu, an airborne disease -- because we know that in the past, in 1918, with the Spanish Flu, millions of people around the world died -- it can go very fast. So this is an example where our goal is to work with the Brazilians, with the Cubans, with the Argentinians, with everyone so that we are pooling our resources, solving the problem quickly, getting clinical trials done quickly, finding ways that are culturally appropriate to make sure that people get the medicines they need quickly.  And if we use the old model where each country is doing its own thing and working with its own companies, and not worrying about whats happening elsewhere, we're not going to solve it. So I think the opportunities for collaboration are there.  They are strong.  We're going to be developing over the next several months, I hope, a plan for the kind of collaboration that you described.  Now, it won't all change overnight, but we do think that we can make progress in this area.  And this is the kind of thing that not only solves problems but it also breeds understanding.  It creates -- it makes people simpatico -- right -- in a way that reduces the possibilities of conflict over time. So it's an excellent question.  Thank you. All right.  It's a gentlemans turn.  Lets see, this gentleman right here in the sweater. Question:  Hi.  And welcome to Argentina, Mr. President.  And first of all, I would like to say thank you for having us here.  It's a pleasure and an honor.  And thank you, and thanks, Argentina -- as a truly proud member of the gay community -- for fighting for our rights as humans, as we all are. My question is, given the fact that, right in the world, most of the main causes of death -- such as heart disease or chronic lower respiratory disease, diabetes, or even clandestine abortion in Argentina -- can be prevented with proper health education, climate change policies, and of course medical research.  So which ones do you think are, in these seven years now as President of the United States, your greatest achievements in terms of those issues? President Obama:  Well, first of all, I had to start in the United States, because we were the only advanced nation on Earth that didnt have a universal health care program, and so we had millions of people who did not have health care.  So I had, as some of you know, a very big fight to establish a system -- that's not ideal because we had to modify it and adapt it to the existing system that we already had, but that has now provided 20 million people with health care that didnt have it before. So part of the answer is to make sure that people have access to basic care, particularly preventive care.  Because so many of the diseases that occur around the world, we can prevent fairly cheaply, and once people are sick, then it's very expensive.  So, in Africa, if we can get mosquito nets -- we know that a lot of disease and death is caused by mosquito-borne diseases.  And we've pushed very hard, and we are now in a position where we could potentially, if not completely, eliminate and then shrink drastically the incidents of malaria around the world. It's not that complicated.  It's just a matter of organizing how we do it.  And we know we've done it before because polio, for example, is an area where there's been enormous progress, and there's just a few pockets of polio left in the world.  Small pox, same thing.  So we know how to do this.  It's a matter of global organization that's very important.  So that's point number one. Point number two.  People's incomes have to be increased.  Nothing kills you like poverty.  And so you can't separate trying to make people healthier from giving them the ability to make enough money and have enough resources to support themselves and their families.  One of the things that we've done, in addition to the global health initiatives that we've worked on, is programs like Feed the Future.  And what we do is not give food -- although we obviously are the biggest contributor of food around the world -- but what we do is we take small farmers and we say, what is it that you need to increase yields? And in some cases, it may be something as simple as new seeds.  In some cases, it may be something as simple as a small mechanized system so that they can process the seeds on sites.  And just that small amount of processing allows them to sell it on the market more expensive because they dont have to send it to a big grainery, and that person takes a cut of their income.  And by getting a little bit more money, now maybe they can buy a small tractor in a cooperative. And what we've been able to do is to see small landholders increase their incomes by five, seven, ten times.  And suddenly, they become not just farmers but small business people, and they start hiring people.  And it creates a new economy in those communities.  And that's not just an economic program, it's also a health program -- because if they've got more money and now they've got a roof over their heads, and they can afford a mosquito net, and they're eating better so their body has greater immunity to diseases, there's enormous improvement generally. Now, the good news -- remember I said this is why I'm optimistic -- if you look at the U.N. Millennium goals that were set 20 years ago, we did not achieve all the goals.  But infant mortality has dropped dramatically during that period of time.  The number of people who live in extreme poverty has dropped dramatically during this time.  And so I was very glad that the U.N. came together this year around a new set of sustainable development goals.  If we can do that, and we continue with the kinds of joint health care programs that I discussed, then I'm optimistic that we'll continue to see progress.  Because most of the deaths that happen, they happen to infants with preventable diseases; they happen to mothers when they're giving birth; they occur because of diseases that could have been prevented with very little money and people having slightly higher incomes. And so it's going to be up to young people like you, though, to continue to find new areas where we can make progress and make improvements.  Good luck. The young woman right there.  Yes, right there. Question:  Good afternoon. President Obama:  Good afternoon. Question:  First of all, I want to thank your country and your administration for investing in women like me and others from around the world that use sports as a way of developing other women through the Global Sports Mentoring Program. President Obama:  Excellent. Question:  And then you mentioned two things during your speech before.  One was that this is the generation that needs to make a change in the world -- and I honestly believe that.  And then you also mentioned that we cannot expect to create those changes if we keep on doing the same things over and over for this amount of years.  And in my opinion, when it comes to businesses, that's kind of the way things are working right now.  And when it comes to social entrepreneurs like myself or social businesses, there are very few countries that have a framework to empower people and social entrepreneurs to create those kinds of businesses.  So my question is, what would be your advice for social entrepreneurs to keep on doing this hard work?  And what do you think is the responsibilities of government to change those rules so that social businesses can be the new kind of businesses in this world? President Obama:  Before I answer your question, tell me a little bit -- tell me about your business.  What is it -- tell me about the programs that you're doing. Question:  Okay, so I run a nonprofit organization in Rosario, and we focus on creating social change by empowering youth living in poverty and by generating civic participation.  By that, we also use innovative tools such as coding for kids, new type of businesses we develop -- we help them achieve and develop life skills.  That's what we are doing right now. President Obama:  And how long has the program been going on? Question:  Almost 10 years now. President Obama:  Okay.  Excellent.  Well, I started in the nonprofit sector in community work, and so it's something that I care deeply about.  Each country is different.  In the United States, most social entrepreneurs are typically financed through the private sector.  Essentially philanthropies, rich people, or businesses, they finance it.  Other countries -- it will come through the government and the taxes that people pay. But what we've learned is that for many of the social problems that we face, it has to be a combination of the private sector and the nonprofit sector and government working together to really make a difference.  And what do I mean by that?  So I'm sure if you go into a poor neighborhood in Argentina, just like a poor neighborhood in the United States, there are a lot of different kinds of problems.  You have, first of all, economic issues because these communities don't have jobs, businesses have not invested in them; in some cases, it may be factories that used to be there moved away, and so the jobs that people used to have there no longer exist. So part of the effort has to be how do we bring private-sector businesses and attract investment into those communities to create jobs. That's point number one.  But the businesses may not come unless the government has built the infrastructure -- the roads or the Wi-Fi connections or what have you.  So the government has to make an investment.  And even if the businesses and the government are prepared to do what they need to do, the human capital -- the people -- they have to make sure that they're getting the education that they need, the training that they need. In some cases, in the United States at least, if they're very poor communities, you have young people who have been in poor families for generations.  So they may not even know what the inside of an office building looks like.  They may never have experienced what it means to go to a job at a certain time and structure their day in an organized way. And that's where a nonprofit, a social entrepreneur, can come and say, we'll partner with young people and have a professional or an adult who is working with that person and showing them, this is what's possible for you.  Opening their eyes to telling some young girl in a poor neighborhood, you can be a computer scientist and why don't you come with me, and this is what computers are, they're not that complicated, this is what coding means, and if you can do math, then you can start coding.  And suddenly, just by them seeing the possibilities, that inspires their effort. The point is, is that each of those pieces are important.  I don't know enough about how social entrepreneurs and community organizations and nonprofits are financed here in Argentina to give you a good opinion.  I could give you an opinion -- politicians always can give you opinions, but I can't give you a good opinion because I don't have enough information about what changes might be made to give an organization like yours more support. But one of the things that's interesting that's happening in the United States is that you're starting to see organizations that are kind of a blend of for-profit and non-for-profit.  So they might have a business component that, let's say, sells handcrafts and artwork that's made by a community for profit, but then the money goes into financing the social programs that help give people these opportunities.  And how they're treated in terms of taxes and the corporate organization -- that's going to change by country.  Each country is going to have a different model.  But more and more, I believe that that's going to be the wave of the future if we want to make progress on these problems. I guess to make a broader point, so often in the past there's been a sharp division between left and right, between capitalist and communist or socialist.  And especially in the Americas, that's been a big debate, right?  Oh, you know, you're a capitalist Yankee dog, and oh, you know, you're some crazy communist that's going to take away everybody's property.  And I mean, those are interesting intellectual arguments, but I think for your generation, you should be practical and just choose from what works.  You don't have to worry about whether it neatly fits into socialist theory or capitalist theory -- you should just decide what works. And I said this to President Castro in Cuba.  I said, look, you've made great progress in educating young people.  Every child in Cuba gets a basic education -- that's a huge improvement from where it was.  Medical care -- the life expectancy of Cubans is equivalent to the United States, despite it being a very poor country, because they have access to health care.  That's a huge achievement.  They should be congratulated.  But you drive around Havana and you say this economy is not working.  It looks like it did in the 1950s.  And so you have to be practical in asking yourself how can you achieve the goals of equality and inclusion, but also recognize that the market system produces a lot of wealth and goods and services.  And it also gives individuals freedom because they have initiative. And so you don't have to be rigid in saying its either this or that, you can say -- depending on the problem you're trying to solve, depending on the social issues that you're trying to address what works.  And I think that what youll find is that the most successful societies, the most successful economies are ones that are rooted in a market-based system, but also recognize that a market does not work by itself.  It has to have a social and moral and ethical and community basis, and there has to be inclusion.  Otherwise its not stable. And its up to you -- whether you're in business or in academia or the nonprofit sector, whatever you're doing -- to create new forms that are adapted to the new conditions that we live in today. Okay, lets see.  Its a guys turn, a gentlemans turn.  Hold on a second.  That guy right there, in the dark shirt.  Yes, you.  No, right there.  Go ahead.  You.  Yes, I can hear you.  Go ahead.  Speak right into the microphone.  You don't have a microphone.  Where is the microphone?  Here, its coming.  But be careful.  Don't fall over.  Its a little tight over there. Question:  Hello? President Obama:  Yes, I can hear you now. Question:  Hello, Mr. President.  I am a senior in high school.  This fall I will be -- I will start studying international relations in American University at the School of International Service. President Obama:  Excellent.  We look forward to seeing you. Question:  Thank you.  My question --  President Obama:  Make sure to bring a coat, though.  Its going to be cool during the winter. Question:  My question to you is regarding the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.  I am an Arab Israeli myself.  And the reality is that with an increase of illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank, this is leading to more and more -- to having a binational state. Do you think that a binational state where there is an Israeli Prime Minister and a Palestinian President, or a Palestinian Prime Minister and an Israeli President is a possibility? President Obama:  No, its an interesting question.  I was asked at the press conference to reflect on the seven and a half years where Ive been President -- where Ive been happy and feel that Ive accomplished my goals, where I think Ive been frustrated.  And obviously the situation with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been an area where despite enormous efforts on my part -- and a lot of peoples parts -- we havent made the kind of progress that I wanted to see. I continue to believe that the only way to resolve this issue is to have an Israeli predominantly Jewish state that is secure and safe, side by side with a sovereign and contiguous Palestinian state. And the reason I say that is because I think the aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own and self-determination is too strong to be denied.  And I also think that the Jewish people, given their history, have to feel that they have a state that they are secure with, and that they can preserve from aggression. And so there has been talk about a one-state solution, or sort of divided government.  Its hard for me to envision that being stable.  Theres such deep distrust between the two peoples right now.  And the neighborhood is in such a mess that I continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way. Now, over time that could evolve.  But initially, at least, I think the Palestinians have to feel like they have something of their own that they can say, this is ours and it expresses our deepest aspirations.  And I think that the Jewish people have to feel safe. Now, the problem is, is that history casts a heavy cloud on this.  Each side only remembers its grief, and has a very difficult time -- has a very difficult time seeing the other side, the situation.  And both of them have legitimate fears.  And I will also say, though, that in some ways because Israeli society has been so successful economically, it has I think from a position of strength been less willing to make concessions.  On the other hand, the Palestinians because of weakness have not had the political cohesion and organization to enter into negotiations and feel like they can get what they need.  And so both side just go to separate corners.  And we have worked and worked and worked. And last year and the year before that, John Kerry -- that poor man, he was flying back and forth, and taking messages back and forth, and I was making phone calls.  But ultimately we can't do it for them.  And so the tragedy of the situation there is that until the populations of both peoples recognize the truth, which is they're going to be living together one way or another.  And the question is:  Are you going to be living together with checkpoints and people being stabbed and hatred?  Or are you going to be living together in a way that creates opportunity and hope for children?  Until they make that decision and that is reflected in the political leaders they elected, and the politics that they promote, theres very little that we can do to force it to happen. That doesn't mean we don't keep trying and trying to persuade and provide incentives.  But ultimately, this is going to be something that those people have to decide on. And heres the last thing I will say, though, and Ive said this to Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Ive said this publicly.  If you look at the demographics of the region and the West Bank and Gaza, and the Arab-Israeli population, its growing much faster than the Jewish population.  If you don't find a way to resolve the conflict, then over time you're going to have to make a choice:  Do we preserve this as a Jewish state, but it is now no longer a democracy?  Because if it was, then the Jewish people would be a small minority.  Or do you preserve its Jewish character, but now it is -- or do you preserve the democracy, but now its no longer a predominantly Jewish state?  You're going to have to make a choice. The only way to avoid that choice -- if you want to preserve it as a predominantly Jewish state and a democracy, then you have to give the Palestinian people and Arab people who are living in that community their own state in order to have self-determination.  And I hope that that happens. And even once Im no longer President, I will continue to try to promote that peaceful dialogue.  But I will be the first one to confess this is not something I was able to get done.  And Im not that hopeful that its going to happen in the next nine months.  Its been 60 years; its not going to happen in the next nine months. All right, so Im going to go back here in the shadows here. I didn't even see these folks back here.  Yes, this gentleman in the t-shirt and the sunglasses.  This side hasnt gotten attention?  Okay, you'll be nice. Question:  [As interpreted.]  The question is, taking into account that Donald Trump is one of the candidates in the Republican Party, why do you think that the people is supporting the policies that he supports?  And do you think that he will reach the presidency? President Obama:  So the question was about the elections, the elections in the United States.  Look, politics in the United States is complicated, just like every other country.  You know something about this here in Argentina.  Politics is complicated.  But that's part of the problem with and the benefit of a democracy, which is, it's loud and it's noisy and complicated. What you're seeing right now is, in part, that the Republican Party has moved to the right very strongly during the course of my presidency.  Now, there are a lot of reasons for that.  But that's just a fact.  And I think that the Republican Party, because of their efforts to oppose me, found themselves taking positions that were further and further away from the mainstream.  It was successful in some ways in getting congressional candidates elected, because during the elections the turnout is typically very low, and so the most passionate people vote.  And in this new media age where people are getting their info, as I said before, in sound bites, and where they dont necessarily get the same information, depending on whether they're on the left or on the right, they can decide, I'm only going to read the things I agree with already, as opposed to getting a broader opinion. What happened was, is that it reinforced a politics that was based on what they oppose as opposed to what they were for. And primarily, they opposed me.  And so that's what's happening inside of the Republican Party.  Within the Democratic Party, which I think is not going through as big of a change, I do think that Mr. Sanders and Secretary Clinton are responding to a continued concern, which is the economy has recovered, it is much better than it was when I came into office, but the crisis that we went through in 2008-2009 has left a lot of people feeling more insecure.  And so even though their lives are better now, they're worried how is it going to be in the future. And they see some of the global trends that you probably see here in Argentina, which is globalization is disrupted, and the days are over where you get a job and you stay in it for 30 years or 40 years, and then you retire and you have a pension, and it's all simple.  Now you might have a job for five years, and then the company closes and you've got to retrain, and you've got to go to another job, and you're trying to figure out how to save to pay for your child's education, while you're also trying to save for retirement. So you're starting to see, I think, a more vocal discussion of changing some of the economic arrangements and institutional arrangements in the United States.  And in that sense, this is the same debate that's taking place everywhere in the advanced economies.  What you're seeing is more and more growth is going to just a few, and the poor may have improved a little bit, but the middle class starts to feel more insecure.  And that creates a willingness to question some of the existing institutional arrangements. So both on the left and the right, there are disruptions and people are asking more serious questions about the economy.  It's just that it's a little more extreme in the Republican Party.  But look, I am a Democratic President, so you should assume that my answer is a little biased.  I will acknowledge that. The good news is, though, that ultimately I have great trust and great faith in the American people.  I think, ultimately, they will make a good decision in terms of the next President and the next administration.  I also think that one of the great advantages of the United States system, even though it's very frustrating sometimes for the President, is that power is distributed across a lot of institutions.  It's what we call separation of powers and decentralization.  So it's not just that the President and Congress are separate centers of power; it's also true that you have state governments that are powerful.  The private sector is powerful.  And this makes it hard sometimes for America to change as rapidly as we need to, to respond to changed circumstances or problems because it's sort of like herding cats -- you're constantly trying to get everybody to work together and move in the same direction at the same time.  And that's difficult. The advantage is that even if we end up with somebody who I might not consider a great President, there is a limit to some of the damage that they can do because -- and I'm sure Republicans feel that about me -- they're glad that there's distribution of power because they imagine that I would have turned the United States into Cuba, I suppose.  They tend to exaggerate little bit how I see the world. But that's why I think that the United States has been stable as a democracy for a very long time.  And that's why I think not only do I have confidence the American people will make a good choice, but we usually can recover from mistakes and typically we find leadership, and because it's a democracy, there are enough voices that lift up to correct those mistakes over time. Last question?  Okay.  This young lady right here. Question:   Good afternoon. President Obama:  Good afternoon. Question:  I'm 16 years old.  I was part of the Young Ambassadors Program 2015, sponsored by the U.S. Department of State.  Thanks to that program, I had a chance to see the world from a different point of view by living with a host community in Missouri. President Obama:  In Missouri? Question:   Yes, in Kansas City -- President Obama:  What city -- what town were you in?", "filename": "23March2016YoungLeadersTownHallinArgentina.txt"}, {"question": "President Obama:  Okay, where were you in Missouri? Question:  Kansas City. President Obama:  Yes, in Kansas City. Question:  So that made me realize how different and similar are the cultures between Argentina and America.  But at the same time, this program was given to us to make an impact in our community when we came back.  And I was thinking, why sometimes it's so hard for nations to work together to invent a better world?  Why sometimes it's hard for political leaders to get along if, after all, we are all humans, and we all have blood in our veins, and we all want the world to be a better place? But sometimes you see news, terrorific things, and you just think, why can't I be President to change that?  So you are a President, and maybe you can answer me? President Obama:  Well, first of all -- so I'm just curious -- what was the thing that you thought was most different about the United States?  What was the thing that surprised you or you said, well this is -- I did not expect this? Question:  I'm real sorry the question -- the answer is not going to be a serious one, but toilets. President Obama:  Were they better or worse?", "filename": "23March2016YoungLeadersTownHallinArgentina.txt"}, {"question": "For over two centuries, the United States has been bound together by founding documents that defined who we are as Americans, and served as our compass through every type of change.  Matters of war and peace are no different.  Americans are deeply ambivalent about war, but having fought for our independence, we know a price must be paid for freedom.  From the Civil War to our struggle against fascism, on through the long twilight struggle of the Cold War, battlefields have changed and technology has evolved.  But our commitment to constitutional principles has weathered every war, and every war has come to an end. With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a new dawn of democracy took hold abroad, and a decade of peace and prosperity arrived here at home.  And for a moment, it seemed the 21st century would be a tranquil time.  And then, on September 11, 2001, we were shaken out of complacency.  Thousands were taken from us, as clouds of fire and metal and ash descended upon a sun-filled morning.  This was a different kind of war.  No armies came to our shores, and our military was not the principal target.  Instead, a group of terrorists came to kill as many civilians as they could. And so our nation went to war.  We have now been at war for well over a decade.  I wont review the full history.  What is clear is that we quickly drove al Qaeda out of Afghanistan, but then shifted our focus and began a new war in Iraq.  And this carried significant consequences for our fight against al Qaeda, our standing in the world, and -- to this day -- our interests in a vital region. Meanwhile, we strengthened our defenses -- hardening targets, tightening transportation security, giving law enforcement new tools to prevent terror.  Most of these changes were sound.  Some caused inconvenience.  But some, like expanded surveillance, raised difficult questions about the balance that we strike between our interests in security and our values of privacy.  And in some cases, I believe we compromised our basic values -- by using torture to interrogate our enemies, and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law. So after I took office, we stepped up the war against al Qaeda but we also sought to change its course.  We relentlessly targeted al Qaedas leadership.  We ended the war in Iraq, and brought nearly 150,000 troops home.  We pursued a new strategy in Afghanistan, and increased our training of Afghan forces.  We unequivocally banned torture, affirmed our commitment to civilian courts, worked to align our policies with the rule of law, and expanded our consultations with Congress. Today, Osama bin Laden is dead, and so are most of his top lieutenants.  There have been no large-scale attacks on the United States, and our homeland is more secure.  Fewer of our troops are in harms way, and over the next 19 months they will continue to come home.  Our alliances are strong, and so is our standing in the world.  In sum, we are safer because of our efforts. Now, make no mistake, our nation is still threatened by terrorists.  From Benghazi to Boston, we have been tragically reminded of that truth.  But we have to recognize that the threat has shifted and evolved from the one that came to our shores on 9/11.  With a decade of experience now to draw from, this is the moment to ask ourselves hard questions -- about the nature of todays threats and how we should confront them. And these questions matter to every American.  For over the last decade, our nation has spent well over a trillion dollars on war, helping to explode our deficits and constraining our ability to nation-build here at home.  Our servicemembers and their families have sacrificed far more on our behalf.  Nearly 7,000 Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice. Many more have left a part of themselves on the battlefield, or brought the shadows of battle back home.  From our use of drones to the detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions that we are making now will define the type of nation -- and world -- that we leave to our children.   So America is at a crossroads.  We must define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will define us.  We have to be mindful of James Madisons warning that No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare.  Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of terror.  We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society.  But what we can do -- what we must do -- is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger to us, and make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all the while maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.  And to define that strategy, we have to make decisions based not on fear, but on hard-earned wisdom.  That begins with understanding the current threat that we face. Today, the core of al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan is on the path to defeat.  Their remaining operatives spend more time thinking about their own safety than plotting against us.  They did not direct the attacks in Benghazi or Boston.  Theyve not carried out a successful attack on our homeland since 9/11. Instead, what weve seen is the emergence of various al Qaeda affiliates.  From Yemen to Iraq, from Somalia to North Africa, the threat today is more diffuse, with Al Qaedas affiliates in the Arabian Peninsula -- AQAP -- the most active in plotting against our homeland.  And while none of AQAPs efforts approach the scale of 9/11, they have continued to plot acts of terror, like the attempt to blow up an airplane on Christmas Day in 2009. Unrest in the Arab world has also allowed extremists to gain a foothold in countries like Libya and Syria.  But here, too, there are differences from 9/11.  In some cases, we continue to confront state-sponsored networks like Hezbollah that engage in acts of terror to achieve political goals.  Other of these groups are simply collections of local militias or extremists interested in seizing territory.  And while we are vigilant for signs that these groups may pose a transnational threat, most are focused on operating in the countries and regions where they are based.  And that means we'll face more localized threats like what we saw in Benghazi, or the BP oil facility in Algeria, in which local operatives -- perhaps in loose affiliation with regional networks -- launch periodic attacks against Western diplomats, companies, and other soft targets, or resort to kidnapping and other criminal enterprises to fund their operations. And finally, we face a real threat from radicalized individuals here in the United States.  Whether its a shooter at a Sikh Temple in Wisconsin, a plane flying into a building in Texas, or the extremists who killed 168 people at the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, America has confronted many forms of violent extremism in our history.  Deranged or alienated individuals -- often U.S. citizens or legal residents -- can do enormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger notions of violent jihad.  And that pull towards extremism appears to have led to the shooting at Fort Hood and the bombing of the Boston Marathon.  So thats the current threat -- lethal yet less capable al Qaeda affiliates; threats to diplomatic facilities and businesses abroad; homegrown extremists.  This is the future of terrorism. We have to take these threats seriously, and do all that we can to confront them.  But as we shape our response, we have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11.  In the 1980s, we lost Americans to terrorism at our Embassy in Beirut; at our Marine Barracks in Lebanon; on a cruise ship at sea; at a disco in Berlin; and on a Pan Am flight -- Flight 103  -- over Lockerbie.  In the 1990s, we lost Americans to terrorism at the World Trade Center; at our military facilities in Saudi Arabia; and at our Embassy in Kenya.  These attacks were all brutal; they were all deadly; and we learned that left unchecked, these threats can grow.  But if dealt with smartly and proportionally, these threats need not rise to the level that we saw on the eve of 9/11. Moreover, we have to recognize that these threats dont arise in a vacuum.  Most, though not all, of the terrorism we faced is fueled by a common ideology -- a belief by some extremists that Islam is in conflict with the United States and the West, and that violence against Western targets, including civilians, is justified in pursuit of a larger cause.  Of course, this ideology is based on a lie, for the United States is not at war with Islam.  And this ideology is rejected by the vast majority of Muslims, who are the most frequent victims of terrorist attacks. Nevertheless, this ideology persists, and in an age when ideas and images can travel the globe in an instant, our response to terrorism cant depend on military or law enforcement alone. We need all elements of national power to win a battle of wills, a battle of ideas.  So what I want to discuss here today is the components of such a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy.  First, we must finish the work of defeating al Qaeda and its associated forces. In Afghanistan, we will complete our transition to Afghan responsibility for that countrys security.  Our troops will come home.  Our combat mission will come to an end.  And we will work with the Afghan government to train security forces, and sustain a counterterrorism force, which ensures that al Qaeda can never again establish a safe haven to launch attacks against us or our allies. Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror, but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America.  In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.  Already, thousands of Pakistani soldiers have lost their lives fighting extremists.  In Yemen, we are supporting security forces that have reclaimed territory from AQAP.  In Somalia, we helped a coalition of African nations push al-Shabaab out of its strongholds.  In Mali, were providing military aid to French-led intervention to push back al Qaeda in the Maghreb, and help the people of Mali reclaim their future. Much of our best counterterrorism cooperation results in the gathering and sharing of intelligence, the arrest and prosecution of terrorists.  And thats how a Somali terrorist apprehended off the coast of Yemen is now in a prison in New York.  Thats how we worked with European allies to disrupt plots from Denmark to Germany to the United Kingdom.  Thats how intelligence collected with Saudi Arabia helped us stop a cargo plane from being blown up over the Atlantic.  These partnerships work. But despite our strong preference for the detention and prosecution of terrorists, sometimes this approach is foreclosed. Al Qaeda and its affiliates try to gain foothold in some of the most distant and unforgiving places on Earth.  They take refuge in remote tribal regions.  They hide in caves and walled compounds.  They train in empty deserts and rugged mountains. In some of these places -- such as parts of Somalia and Yemen -- the state only has the most tenuous reach into the territory.  In other cases, the state lacks the capacity or will to take action.  And its also not possible for America to simply deploy a team of Special Forces to capture every terrorist.  Even when such an approach may be possible, there are places where it would pose profound risks to our troops and local civilians -- where a terrorist compound cannot be breached without triggering a firefight with surrounding tribal communities, for example, that pose no threat to us; times when putting U.S. boots on the ground may trigger a major international crisis. To put it another way, our operation in Pakistan against Osama bin Laden cannot be the norm.  The risks in that case were immense.  The likelihood of capture, although that was our preference, was remote given the certainty that our folks would confront resistance.  The fact that we did not find ourselves confronted with civilian casualties, or embroiled in an extended firefight, was a testament to the meticulous planning and professionalism of our Special Forces, but it also depended on some luck.  And it was supported by massive infrastructure in Afghanistan.  And even then, the cost to our relationship with Pakistan -- and the backlash among the Pakistani public over encroachment on their territory -- was so severe that we are just now beginning to rebuild this important partnership. So it is in this context that the United States has taken lethal, targeted action against al Qaeda and its associated forces, including with remotely piloted aircraft commonly referred to as drones.  As was true in previous armed conflicts, this new technology raises profound questions -- about who is targeted, and why; about civilian casualties, and the risk of creating new enemies; about the legality of such strikes under U.S. and international law; about accountability and morality.  So let me address these questions.  To begin with, our actions are effective.  Dont take my word for it.  In the intelligence gathered at bin Ladens compound, we found that he wrote, We could lose the reserves to enemys air strikes.  We cannot fight air strikes with explosives.  Other communications from al Qaeda operatives confirm this as well.  Dozens of highly skilled al Qaeda commanders, trainers, bomb makers and operatives have been taken off the battlefield.  Plots have been disrupted that would have targeted international aviation, U.S. transit systems, European cities and our troops in Afghanistan.  Simply put, these strikes have saved lives. Moreover, Americas actions are legal.  We were attacked on 9/11.  Within a week, Congress overwhelmingly authorized the use of force.  Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.  We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.  So this is a just war -- a war waged proportionally, in last resort, and in self-defense. And yet, as our fight enters a new phase, Americas legitimate claim of self-defense cannot be the end of the discussion.  To say a military tactic is legal, or even effective, is not to say it is wise or moral in every instance.  For the same human progress that gives us the technology to strike half a world away also demands the discipline to constrain that power -- or risk abusing it.  And thats why, over the last four years, my administration has worked vigorously to establish a framework that governs our use of force against terrorists - insisting upon clear guidelines, oversight and accountability that is now codified in Presidential Policy Guidance that I signed yesterday. In the Afghan war theater, we must -- and will -- continue to support our troops until the transition is complete at the end of 2014.  And that means we will continue to take strikes against high value al Qaeda targets, but also against forces that are massing to support attacks on coalition forces.  But by the end of 2014, we will no longer have the same need for force protection, and the progress weve made against core al Qaeda will reduce the need for unmanned strikes. Beyond the Afghan theater, we only target al Qaeda and its associated forces.  And even then, the use of drones is heavily constrained.  America does not take strikes when we have the ability to capture individual terrorists; our preference is always to detain, interrogate, and prosecute.  America cannot take strikes wherever we choose; our actions are bound by consultations with partners, and respect for state sovereignty.  America does not take strikes to punish individuals; we act against terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people, and when there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat.  And before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured -- the highest standard we can set. Now, this last point is critical, because much of the criticism about drone strikes -- both here at home and abroad -- understandably centers on reports of civilian casualties.  Theres a wide gap between U.S. assessments of such casualties and nongovernmental reports.  Nevertheless, it is a hard fact that U.S. strikes have resulted in civilian casualties, a risk that exists in every war.  And for the families of those civilians, no words or legal construct can justify their loss.  For me, and those in my chain of command, those deaths will haunt us as long as we live, just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred throughout conventional fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. But as Commander-in-Chief, I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternatives.  To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties -- not just in our cities at home and our facilities abroad, but also in the very places like Sanaa and Kabul and Mogadishu where terrorists seek a foothold.  Remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians, and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes.  So doing nothing is not an option. Where foreign governments cannot or will not effectively stop terrorism in their territory, the primary alternative to targeted lethal action would be the use of conventional military options.  As Ive already said, even small special operations carry enormous risks.  Conventional airpower or missiles are far less precise than drones, and are likely to cause more civilian casualties and more local outrage.  And invasions of these territories lead us to be viewed as occupying armies, unleash a torrent of unintended consequences, are difficult to contain, result in large numbers of civilian casualties and ultimately empower those who thrive on violent conflict.  So it is false to assert that putting boots on the ground is less likely to result in civilian deaths or less likely to create enemies in the Muslim world.  The results would be more U.S. deaths, more Black Hawks down, more confrontations with local populations, and an inevitable mission creep in support of such raids that could easily escalate into new wars. Yes, the conflict with al Qaeda, like all armed conflict, invites tragedy.  But by narrowly targeting our action against those who want to kill us and not the people they hide among, we are choosing the course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life. Our efforts must be measured against the history of putting American troops in distant lands among hostile populations.  In Vietnam, hundreds of thousands of civilians died in a war where the boundaries of battle were blurred.  In Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the extraordinary courage and discipline of our troops, thousands of civilians have been killed.  So neither conventional military action nor waiting for attacks to occur offers moral safe harbor, and neither does a sole reliance on law enforcement in territories that have no functioning police or security services -- and indeed, have no functioning law.  Now, this is not to say that the risks are not real.  Any U.S. military action in foreign lands risks creating more enemies and impacts public opinion overseas.  Moreover, our laws constrain the power of the President even during wartime, and I have taken an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States.  The very precision of drone strikes and the necessary secrecy often involved in such actions can end up shielding our government from the public scrutiny that a troop deployment invites.  It can also lead a President and his team to view drone strikes as a cure-all for terrorism. And for this reason, Ive insisted on strong oversight of all lethal action.  After I took office, my administration began briefing all strikes outside of Iraq and Afghanistan to the appropriate committees of Congress.  Let me repeat that:  Not only did Congress authorize the use of force, it is briefed on every strike that America takes.  Every strike.  That includes the one instance when we targeted an American citizen -- Anwar Awlaki, the chief of external operations for AQAP. This week, I authorized the declassification of this action, and the deaths of three other Americans in drone strikes, to facilitate transparency and debate on this issue and to dismiss some of the more outlandish claims that have been made.  For the record, I do not believe it would be constitutional for the government to target and kill any U.S. citizen -- with a drone, or with a shotgun -- without due process, nor should any President deploy armed drones over U.S. soil. But when a U.S. citizen goes abroad to wage war against America and is actively plotting to kill U.S. citizens, and when neither the United States, nor our partners are in a position to capture him before he carries out a plot, his citizenship should no more serve as a shield than a sniper shooting down on an innocent crowd should be protected from a SWAT team. Thats who Anwar Awlaki was -- he was continuously trying to kill people.  He helped oversee the 2010 plot to detonate explosive devices on two U.S.-bound cargo planes.  He was involved in planning to blow up an airliner in 2009.  When Farouk Abdulmutallab -- the Christmas Day bomber -- went to Yemen in 2009, Awlaki hosted him, approved his suicide operation, helped him tape a martyrdom video to be shown after the attack, and his last instructions were to blow up the airplane when it was over American soil.  I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot, but we couldnt.  And as President, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out. Of course, the targeting of any American raises constitutional issues that are not present in other strikes -- which is why my administration submitted information about Awlaki to the Department of Justice months before Awlaki was killed, and briefed the Congress before this strike as well.  But the high threshold that weve set for taking lethal action applies to all potential terrorist targets, regardless of whether or not they are American citizens.  This threshold respects the inherent dignity of every human life.  Alongside the decision to put our men and women in uniform in harms way, the decision to use force against individuals or groups -- even against a sworn enemy of the United States -- is the hardest thing I do as President.  But these decisions must be made, given my responsibility to protect the American people. Going forward, Ive asked my administration to review proposals to extend oversight of lethal actions outside of warzones that go beyond our reporting to Congress.  Each option has virtues in theory, but poses difficulties in practice.  For example, the establishment of a special court to evaluate and authorize lethal action has the benefit of bringing a third branch of government into the process, but raises serious constitutional issues about presidential and judicial authority. Another idea thats been suggested -- the establishment of an independent oversight board in the executive branch -- avoids those problems, but may introduce a layer of bureaucracy into national security decision-making, without inspiring additional public confidence in the process.  But despite these challenges, I look forward to actively engaging Congress to explore these and other options for increased oversight. I believe, however, that the use of force must be seen as part of a larger discussion we need to have about a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy -- because for all the focus on the use of force, force alone cannot make us safe.  We cannot use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root; and in the absence of a strategy that reduces the wellspring of extremism, a perpetual war -- through drones or Special Forces or troop deployments -- will prove self-defeating, and alter our country in troubling ways. So the next element of our strategy involves addressing the underlying grievances and conflicts that feed extremism -- from North Africa to South Asia.  As weve learned this past decade, this is a vast and complex undertaking.  We must be humble in our expectation that we can quickly resolve deep-rooted problems like poverty and sectarian hatred.  Moreover, no two countries are alike, and some will undergo chaotic change before things get better.  But our security and our values demand that we make the effort. This means patiently supporting transitions to democracy in places like Egypt and Tunisia and Libya -- because the peaceful realization of individual aspirations will serve as a rebuke to violent extremists.  We must strengthen the opposition in Syria, while isolating extremist elements -- because the end of a tyrant must not give way to the tyranny of terrorism.  We are actively working to promote peace between Israelis and Palestinians -- because it is right and because such a peace could help reshape attitudes in the region.  And we must help countries modernize economies, upgrade education, and encourage entrepreneurship -- because American leadership has always been elevated by our ability to connect with peoples hopes, and not simply their fears. And success on all these fronts requires sustained engagement, but it will also require resources.  I know that foreign aid is one of the least popular expenditures that there is.  Thats true for Democrats and Republicans -- Ive seen the polling -- even though it amounts to less than one percent of the federal budget.  In fact, a lot of folks think its 25 percent, if you ask people on the streets.  Less than one percent -- still wildly unpopular.  But foreign assistance cannot be viewed as charity.  It is fundamental to our national security.  And its fundamental to any sensible long-term strategy to battle extremism.  Moreover, foreign assistance is a tiny fraction of what we spend fighting wars that our assistance might ultimately prevent. For what we spent in a month in Iraq at the height of the war, we could be training security forces in Libya, maintaining peace agreements between Israel and its neighbors, feeding the hungry in Yemen, building schools in Pakistan, and creating reservoirs of goodwill that marginalize extremists.  That has to be part of our strategy. Moreover, America cannot carry out this work if we dont have diplomats serving in some very dangerous places.  Over the past decade, we have strengthened security at our embassies, and I am implementing every recommendation of the Accountability Review Board, which found unacceptable failures in Benghazi.  Ive called on Congress to fully fund these efforts to bolster security and harden facilities, improve intelligence, and facilitate a quicker response time from our military if a crisis emerges. But even after we take these steps, some irreducible risks to our diplomats will remain.  This is the price of being the worlds most powerful nation, particularly as a wave of change washes over the Arab World.  And in balancing the trade4offs between security and active diplomacy, I firmly believe that any retreat from challenging regions will only increase the dangers that we face in the long run.  And that's why we should be grateful to those diplomats who are willing to serve.  Targeted action against terrorists, effective partnerships, diplomatic engagement and assistance -- through such a comprehensive strategy we can significantly reduce the chances of large-scale attacks on the homeland and mitigate threats to Americans overseas.  But as we guard against dangers from abroad, we cannot neglect the daunting challenge of terrorism from within our borders. As I said earlier, this threat is not new.  But technology and the Internet increase its frequency and in some cases its lethality.  Today, a person can consume hateful propaganda, commit themselves to a violent agenda, and learn how to kill without leaving their home.  To address this threat, two years ago my administration did a comprehensive review and engaged with law enforcement.  And the best way to prevent violent extremism inspired by violent jihadists is to work with the Muslim American community  -- which has consistently rejected terrorism -- to identify signs of radicalization and partner with law enforcement when an individual is drifting towards violence.  And these partnerships can only work when we recognize that Muslims are a fundamental part of the American family.  In fact, the success of American Muslims and our determination to guard against any encroachments on their civil liberties is the ultimate rebuke to those who say that were at war with Islam. Thwarting homegrown plots presents particular challenges in part because of our proud commitment to civil liberties for all who call America home.  Thats why, in the years to come, we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are.  That means reviewing the authorities of law enforcement, so we can intercept new types of communication, but also build in privacy protections to prevent abuse. That means that -- even after Boston -- we do not deport someone or throw somebody in prison in the absence of evidence.  That means putting careful constraints on the tools the government uses to protect sensitive information, such as the state secrets doctrine.  And that means finally having a strong Privacy and Civil Liberties Board to review those issues where our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into tension. The Justice Departments investigation of national security leaks offers a recent example of the challenges involved in striking the right balance between our security and our open society.  As Commander-in-Chief, I believe we must keep information secret that protects our operations and our people in the field.  To do so, we must enforce consequences for those who break the law and breach their commitment to protect classified information.  But a free press is also essential for our democracy.  Thats who we are.  And Im troubled by the possibility that leak investigations may chill the investigative journalism that holds government accountable. Journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs.  Our focus must be on those who break the law.  And thats why Ive called on Congress to pass a media shield law to guard against government overreach.  And Ive raised these issues with the Attorney General, who shares my concerns.  So he has agreed to review existing Department of Justice guidelines governing investigations that involve reporters, and hell convene a group of media organizations to hear their concerns as part of that review.  And Ive directed the Attorney General to report back to me by July 12th. Now, all these issues remind us that the choices we make about war can impact -- in sometimes unintended ways -- the openness and freedom on which our way of life depends.  And that is why I intend to engage Congress about the existing Authorization to Use Military Force, or AUMF, to determine how we can continue to fight terrorism without keeping America on a perpetual wartime footing. The AUMF is now nearly 12 years old.  The Afghan war is coming to an end.  Core al Qaeda is a shell of its former self.  Groups like AQAP must be dealt with, but in the years to come, not every collection of thugs that labels themselves al Qaeda will pose a credible threat to the United States.  Unless we discipline our thinking, our definitions, our actions, we may be drawn into more wars we dont need to fight, or continue to grant Presidents unbound powers more suited for traditional armed conflicts between nation states.  So I look forward to engaging Congress and the American people in efforts to refine, and ultimately repeal, the AUMFs mandate.  And I will not sign laws designed to expand this mandate further.  Our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue.  But this war, like all wars, must end.  Thats what history advises.  Thats what our democracy demands. And that brings me to my final topic:  the detention of terrorist suspects.  Im going to repeat one more time:  As a matter of policy, the preference of the United States is to capture terrorist suspects.  When we do detain a suspect, we interrogate them.  And if the suspect can be prosecuted, we decide whether to try him in a civilian court or a military commission.   During the past decade, the vast majority of those detained by our military were captured on the battlefield.  In Iraq, we turned over thousands of prisoners as we ended the war.  In Afghanistan, we have transitioned detention facilities to the Afghans, as part of the process of restoring Afghan sovereignty. So we bring law of war detention to an end, and we are committed to prosecuting terrorists wherever we can. The glaring exception to this time-tested approach is the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.  The original premise for opening GTMO -- that detainees would not be able to challenge their detention -- was found unconstitutional five years ago.  In the meantime, GTMO has become a symbol around the world for an America that flouts the rule of law.  Our allies wont cooperate with us if they think a terrorist will end up at GTMO.  During a time of budget cuts, we spend $150 million each year to imprison 166 people -- almost $1 million per prisoner.  And the Department of Defense estimates that we must spend another $200 million to keep GTMO open at a time when were cutting investments in education and research here at home, and when the Pentagon is struggling with sequester and budget cuts. As President, I have tried to close GTMO.  I transferred 67 detainees to other countries before Congress imposed restrictions to effectively prevent us from either transferring detainees to other countries or imprisoning them here in the United States.  These restrictions make no sense.  After all, under President Bush, some 530 detainees were transferred from GTMO with Congresss support.  When I ran for President the first time, John McCain supported closing GTMO -- this was a bipartisan issue.  No person has ever escaped one of our super-max or military prisons here in the United States -- ever.  Our courts have convicted hundreds of people for terrorism or terrorism-related offenses, including some folks who are more dangerous than most GTMO detainees.  They're in our prisons.  And given my administrations relentless pursuit of al Qaedas leadership, there is no justification beyond politics for Congress to prevent us from closing a facility that should have never have been opened. Audience Member:  Excuse me, President Obama --  President Obama:  So -- let me finish, ma'am.  So today, once again -- Audience Member:  There are 102 people on a hunger strike.  These are desperate people.  President Obama:  I'm about to address it, ma'am, but you've got to let me speak.  I'm about to address it. Audience Member:  You're our Commander-In-Chief -- President Obama:  Let me address it. Audience Member: -- you an close Guantanamo Bay.  President Obama:  Why dont you let me address it, ma'am. Audience Member:  Theres still prisoners -- President Obama:  Why dont you sit down and I will tell you exactly what I'm going to do. Audience Member:  That includes 57 Yemenis. President Obama:  Thank you, ma'am.  Thank you.  Ma'am, thank you.  You should let me finish my sentence. Today, I once again call on Congress to lift the restrictions on detainee transfers from GTMO. I have asked the Department of Defense to designate a site in the United States where we can hold military commissions.  Im appointing a new senior envoy at the State Department and Defense Department whose sole responsibility will be to achieve the transfer of detainees to third countries.  I am lifting the moratorium on detainee transfers to Yemen so we can review them on a case-by-case basis.  To the greatest extent possible, we will transfer detainees who have been cleared to go to other countries.  Audience Member:  -- prisoners already.  Release them today. President Obama:  Where appropriate, we will bring terrorists to justice in our courts and our military justice system.  And we will insist that judicial review be available for every detainee. Audience Member:  It needs to be -- President Obama:  Now, ma'am, let me finish.  Let me finish, ma'am.  Part of free speech is you being able to speak, but also, you listening and me being able to speak. Now, even after we take these steps one issue will remain -- just how to deal with those GTMO detainees who we know have participated in dangerous plots or attacks but who cannot be prosecuted, for example, because the evidence against them has been compromised or is inadmissible in a court of law.  But once we commit to a process of closing GTMO, I am confident that this legacy problem can be resolved, consistent with our commitment to the rule of law.  I know the politics are hard.  But history will cast a harsh judgment on this aspect of our fight against terrorism and those of us who fail to end it.  Imagine a future -- 10 years from now or 20 years from now -- when the United States of America is still holding people who have been charged with no crime on a piece of land that is not part of our country.  Look at the current situation, where we are force-feeding detainees who are being held on a hunger strike.  I'm willing to cut the young lady who interrupted me some slack because it's worth being passionate about.  Is this who we are?  Is that something our Founders foresaw?  Is that the America we want to leave our children?  Our sense of justice is stronger than that.  We have prosecuted scores of terrorists in our courts.  That includes Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up an airplane over Detroit; and Faisal Shahzad, who put a car bomb in Times Square. It's in a court of law that we will try Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is accused of bombing the Boston Marathon.  Richard Reid, the shoe bomber, is, as we speak, serving a life sentence in a maximum security prison here in the United States.  In sentencing Reid, Judge William Young told him, The way we treat youis the measure of our own liberties. Audience Member:  How about Abdulmutallab -- locking up a 16-year-old -- is that the way we treat a 16-year old?  [Inaudible] -- can you take the drones out of the hands of the CIA?  Can you stop the signature strikes killing people on the basis of suspicious activities?", "filename": "23May2013NationalDefenseUniversitySpeechonTerrorism.txt"}, {"question": "Schieffer:  Good evening from the campus of Lynn University here in Boca Raton, Florida.  This is the fourth and last debate of the 2012 campaign, brought to you by the Commission on Presidential Debates.  This one is on foreign policy.  I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News. The questions are mine and I have not shared them with the candidates or their aides.  The audience has taken a vow of silence -- no applause, no reaction of any kind -- except right now, when we welcome President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney.* Gentlemen, your campaigns have agreed to certain rules, and they are simple.  Theyve asked me to divide the evening into segments.  I'll pose a question at the beginning of each segment. You will each have two minutes to respond, and then we will have a general discussion until we move to the next segment. Tonights debate, as both of you know, comes on the 50th anniversary of the night that President Kennedy told the world that the Soviet Union had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba, perhaps the closest we've ever come to nuclear war.  And it is a sobering reminder that every President faces at some point an unexpected threat to our national security from abroad. So lets begin. The first segment is the challenge of a changing Middle East and the new face of terrorism.  I'm going to put this into two segments, so youll have two topic questions within this one segment on the subject.  The first question -- and it concerns Libya. The controversy over what happened there continues.  Four Americans are dead, including an American Ambassador.  Questions remain of what happened:  What caused it?  Was it spontaneous? Was it an intelligence failure?  Was it a policy failure?  Was there an attempt to mislead people about what really happened? Governor Romney, you said this was an example of an American policy in the Middle East that is unraveling before our very eyes.  I'd like to hear each of you give your thoughts on that.  Governor Romney, you won the toss -- you go first. Governor Romney:  Thank you, Bob.  And thank you for agreeing to moderate this debate this evening.  Thank you to Lynn University for welcoming us here.  And, Mr. President, its good to be with you again.  We were together at a humorous event a little earlier, and its nice to maybe be funny this time -- not on purpose.  We'll see what happens.  This is obviously an area of great concern to the entire world, and to America in particular, which is to see a complete change in the structure and the environment in the Middle East.  With the Arab Spring came a great deal of hope that there would be a change towards more moderation, an opportunity for greater participation on the part of women in public life and in economic life in the Middle East.  But instead we've seen in nation after nation a number of disturbing events. Of course, we see in Syria, 30,000 civilians having been killed by the military there.  We see in Libya, an attack, apparently by -- I think we know now -- by terrorists of some kind against our people there, four people dead.  Our hearts and minds go to them. Mali has been taken over -- the northern part of Mali by al Qaeda-type individuals.  We have in Egypt a Muslim Brotherhood president.  And so what we're seeing is a pretty dramatic reversal of the kind of hopes we had for that region.  Of course, the greatest threat of all is Iran, four years closer to a nuclear weapon.  And we're going to have to recognize that we have to do as the President has done -- I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al Qaeda.  But we can't kill our way out of this mess.  We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the world of Islam and other parts of the world reject this radical, violent extremism, which is -- its certainly not on the run.  Its certainly not hiding.  This is a group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries.  And it presents an enormous threat to our friends, to the world, to America long term, and we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism. Mr. Schieffer:  Mr. President. President Obama:  Well, my first job as Commander-in-Chief, Bob, is to keep the American people safe.  And that's what we've done over the last four years.  We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on those who actually killed us on 9/11. And as a consequence, al Qaedas core leadership has been decimated. In addition, we're now able to transition out of Afghanistan in a responsible way, making sure that Afghans take responsibility for their own security.  And that allows us also to rebuild alliances and make friends around the world to combat future threats.  Now, with respect to Libya, as I indicated in the last debate, when we received that phone call, I immediately made sure that, number one, we did everything we could to secure those Americans who were still in harms way; number two, that we would investigate exactly what happened; and number three, most importantly, that we would go after those who killed Americans and we would bring them to justice.  And thats exactly what were going to do. But I think its important to step back and think about what happened in Libya.  Now, keep in mind that I and Americans took leadership in organizing an international coalition that made sure that we were able to -- without putting troops on the ground, at the cost of less than what we spent in two weeks in Iraq -- liberate a country that had been under the yoke of dictatorship for 40 years, got rid of a despot who had killed Americans.  And, as a consequence, despite this tragedy, you had tens of thousands of Libyans, after the events in Benghazi, marching and saying, America is our friend.  We stand with them.  Now, that represents the opportunity we have to take advantage of.  And, Governor Romney, Im glad that you agree that we have been successful in going after al Qaeda, but I have to tell you that your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map, and is not designed to keep Americans safe or to build on the opportunities that exist in the Middle East. Governor Romney:  Well, my strategy is pretty straightforward, which is to go after the bad guys, to make sure we do our very best to interrupt them, to kill them, to take them out of the picture.  But my strategy is broader than that.  Thats important, of course.  But the key that were going to have to pursue is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own.  We dont want another Iraq.  We dont want another Afghanistan.  Thats not the right course for us.  The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world.  And how do we do that?  A group of Arab scholars came together, organized by the U.N., to look at how we can help the world reject these terrorists.  And the answer they came up with was this:  One, more economic development.  We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment -- and that of our friends -- we should coordinate it to make sure that we push back and give them more economic development.  Number two, better education.  Number three, gender equality.  Number four, the rule of law.  We have to help these nations create civil societies.  But whats been happening over the last couple of years is as weve watched this tumult in the Middle East, this rising tide of chaos occur, you see al Qaeda rushing in.  You see other jihadist groups rushing in.  And theyre throughout many nations in the Middle East.  Its wonderful that Libya seems to be making some progress, despite this terrible tragedy.  But next door, of course, we have Egypt -- Libya is 6 million population, Egypt 80 million population.  We want to make sure that were seeing progress throughout the Middle East, with Mali now having North Mali taken over by al Qaeda; with Syria having Assad continuing to kill -- to murder his own people.  This is a region in tumult.  And of course, Iran on the path to a nuclear weapon -- weve got real problems in the region. Mr. Schieffer:  Lets give the President a chance. President Obama:  Governor Romney, Im glad that you recognize that al Qaeda is a threat, because a few months ago, when you were asked whats the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia -- not al Qaeda -- you said Russia.  And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War has been over for 20 years. But, Governor, when it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s, and the economic policies of the 1920s. You say that youre not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq, but just a few weeks ago you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now.  And the challenge we have -- I know you havent been in a position to actually execute foreign policy, but every time youve offered an opinion, youve been wrong.  You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite the fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction.  You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.  You indicated that we shouldnt be passing nuclear treaties with Russia, despite the fact that 71 senators -- Democrats and Republicans -- voted for it.  Youve said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan; then you said we should; now you say maybe, or it depends -- which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing and sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies. So what we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map.  And unfortunately, that's the kinds of opinions that youve offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength or keeping America safe over the long term. Mr. Schieffer:  Im going to add a couple of minutes here to give you a chance to respond. Governor Romney:  Well, of course, I don't concur with what the President said about my own record and the things that Ive said.  They don't happen to be accurate. But I can say this -- that were talking about the Middle East and how to help the Middle East reject the kind of terrorism were seeing and the rising tide of tumult and confusion.  And attacking me is not an agenda.  Attacking me is not talking about how were going to deal with the challenges that exist in the Middle East and take advantage of the opportunity there and stem the tide of this violence. But Ill respond to a couple of the things you mentioned.  First of all, Russia I indicated is a geopolitical foe, not a -- President Obama:  Number one geopolitical -- Governor Romney:  Excuse me.  Its a geopolitical foe, and I said in the same -- in the same paragraph I said, and Iran is the greatest national security threat we face.  Russia does continue to battle us in the U.N. time and time again.  I have clear eyes on this.  Im not going to wear rose-colored glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr. Putin.  And Im certainly not going to say to him, Ill give you more flexibility after the election.  After the election, hell get more backbone. Number two, with regards to Iraq, you and I agreed, I believe, that there should have been a status of forces agreement.  Did you -- President Obama:  That's not true. Governor Romney:  Oh, you didn't -- you didn't want a status of forces agreement? President Obama:  No, what I -- what I would not have done is left 10,000 troops in Iraq that would tie us down.  That certainly would not help us in the Middle East. Governor Romney:  Im sorry.  You actually -- there was an effort on the part of the President -- President Obama:  You are -- Governor Romney:  -- to have a Status of Forces Agreement -- President Obama:  He was -- Governor Romney:  And I concurred in that and said that we should have some number of troops that stayed on.  That was something I concurred with -- President Obama:  Governor -- Governor Romney:  -- your posture.  That was my posture as well.  You thought it should have been 5,000 troops.  President Obama:  Governor -- Governor Romney:  I thought it should have been more troops.  But you know what, the answer was -- President Obama:  This is just a few weeks ago. Governor Romney:  -- we got no troops through whatsoever.  President Obama:  This is just a few weeks ago that you indicated that we should still have troops in Iraq. Governor Romney:  No, I didn't.  Im sorry, that's -- President Obama:  You made a major speech. Governor Romney:  I indicated that you -- I indicated that you failed to put in place a status of forces agreement -- President Obama:  Governor -- Governor Romney:  -- at the end of the conflict that existed in Iraq.  President Obama:  Governor, heres one thing -- Mr. Schieffer:  Let him answer, please. President Obama:  Heres one thing Ive learned as Commander-in-Chief.  Youve got to be clear both to our allies and our enemies about where you stand and what you mean.  Now, you just gave a speech a few weeks ago in which you said we should still have troops in Iraq.  That is not a recipe for making sure that we are taking advantage of the opportunities and meeting the challenges of the Middle East.  Now, it is absolutely true that we cannot just beat these challenges militarily.  And so what Ive done, throughout my presidency and will continue to do, is, number one, make sure that these countries are supporting our counterterrorism efforts. Number two, make sure that they are standing by our interests in Israels security -- because it is a true friend and our greatest ally in the region.  Number three, we do have to make sure that were protecting religious minorities and women because these countries cant develop unless all the population -- not just half of it -- is developing.  Number four, we do have to develop their economic capabilities.  But number five, the other thing that we have to do is recognize that we cant continue to do nation-building in these regions -- part of American leadership is making sure that were doing nation-building here at home.  That will help us maintain the kind of American leadership that we need. Mr. Schieffer:  Let me interject the second topic question in this segment about the Middle East and so on.  And that is -- you both mentioned -- alluded to this, and that is Syria.  The war in Syria has now spilled over into Lebanon.  We have, what, more than a hundred people that were killed there in a bomb.  There were demonstrations there, eight people dead.  Mr. President, its been more than a year since you saw -- you told Assad he had to go.  Since then, 30,000 Syrians have died.  Weve had 300,000 refugees.  The war goes on; hes still there.  Should we reassess our policy and see if we can find a better way to influence events there, or is that even possible?  And you go first, sir. President Obama:  What weve done is organize the international community, saying Assad has to go.  Weve mobilized sanctions against that government.  We have made sure that they are isolated.  We have provided humanitarian assistance, and we are helping the opposition organize.  And were particularly interested in making sure that were mobilizing the moderate forces inside of Syria. But ultimately, Syrians are going to have to determine their own future.  And so everything were doing, were doing in consultation with our partners in the region -- including Israel, which obviously has a huge interest in seeing what happens in Syria; coordinating with Turkey and other countries in the region that have a great interest in this. Now, what were seeing taking place in Syria is heartbreaking.  And thats why we are going to do everything we can to make sure that we are helping the opposition.  But we also have to recognize that for us to get more entangled militarily in Syria is a serious step.  And we have to do so making absolutely certain that we know who we are helping, that were not putting arms in the hands of folks who eventually could turn them against us or our allies in the region. And I am confident that Assads days are numbered.  But what we cant do is to simply suggest that, as Governor Romney at times has suggested, that giving heavy weapons, for example, to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that would lead us to be safer over the long term. Mr. Schieffer:  Governor. Governor Romney:  Well, lets step back and talk about whats happening in Syria and how important it is.  First of all, 30,000 people being killed by their government is a humanitarian disaster.  Secondly, Syria is an opportunity for us because Syria plays an important role in the Middle East, particularly right now, Syria is Irans only ally in the Arab world.  Its their route to the sea.  Its the route for them to arm Hezbollah in Lebanon, which threatens, of course, our ally, Israel.  And so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us.  Number two, seeing a replacement government being responsible people is critical for us.  And finally, we dont want to have military involvement there.  We dont want to get drawn in to a military conflict.  And so the right course for us is working through our partners and with our own resources to identify responsible parties within Syria, organize them, bring them together in a form of, not government, a form of council that can take the lead in Syria, and then make sure they have the arms necessary to defend themselves. We do need to make sure that they dont have arms that get into the wrong hands, that those arms could be used to hurt us down the road.  We need to make sure as well that we coordinate this effort with our allies, and particularly with Israel.  But the Saudis and the Qatari and the Turks are all very concerned about this.  Theyre willing to work with us.  We need to have a very effective leadership effort in Syria, making sure that the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed are people who will be the responsible parties. Recognize -- I believe that Assad must go.  I believe he will go.  But I believe we want to make sure that we have the relationships of friendship with the people that take his place, such that in the years to come, we see Syria as a friend and Syria as a responsible party in the Middle East.  This is a critical opportunity for America.  And what Im afraid of is weve watched over the past year or so, first the President saying, well, well let the U.N. deal with it and Assad -- excuse me -- Kofi Annan came in and said were going to try -- have a ceasefire.  That didnt work.  Then it looked to the Russians and said, lets see if you can do something.  We should be playing the leadership role there -- not on the ground with military, but play the leadership role. Mr. Schieffer:  All right.  President Obama:  We are playing the leadership role.  We organized the Friends of Syria.  We are mobilizing humanitarian support and support for the opposition.  And we are making sure that those we help are those who will be friends of ours in the long term and friends of our allies in the region over the long term. But going back to Libya, because this is an example of how we make choices -- when we went into Libya, and we were able to immediately stop the massacre there because of the unique circumstances and the coalition that we had helped to organize, we also had to make sure that Muammar Qaddafi didnt stay there. And to the Governors credit, you supported us going into Libya and the coalition that we organized.  But when it came time to making sure that Qaddafi did not stay in power, that he was captured, Governor, your suggestion was that this was mission creep, that this was mission muddle.  Imagine if we had pulled out at that point.  Muammar Qaddafi had more American blood on his hands than any individual other than Osama bin Laden, and so we were going to make sure that we finished the job.  Thats part of the reason why the Libyans stand with us.  But we did so in a careful, thoughtful way, making certain that we knew who we were dealing with; that those forces of moderation on the ground were ones that we could work with.  And we have to take the same kind of steady, thoughtful leadership when it comes to Syria.  Thats exactly what were doing. Mr. Schieffer:  Governor, can I just ask you, would you go beyond what the administration would do?  Like, for example, would you put in no-fly zones over Syria? Governor Romney:  I dont want to have our military involved in Syria.  I dont think theres a necessity to put our military in Syria at this stage.  I dont anticipate that in the future.  As I indicated, our objectives are to replace Assad and to have in place a new government which is friendly to us -- a responsible government, if possible.  And I want to make sure they get armed and they have the arms necessary to defend themselves, but also to remove Assad. But I do not want to see a military involvement on the part of our troops.  And this isnt going to be necessary.  We have -- with our partners in the region, we have sufficient resources to support those groups.  But, look, this has been going on for a year.  This is a time -- this should have been a time for American leadership.  We should have taken a leading role -- not militarily, but a leading role organizationally, governmentally -- to bring together the parties there, to find responsible parties.  As you hear from intelligence sources even today, the insurgents are highly disparate; they havent come together; they havent formed a unity group, a council of some kind.  That needs to happen.  America can help that happen.  And we need to make sure they have the arms they need to carry out the very important role, which is getting rid of Assad. Mr. Schieffer:  Can we get a quick response, Mr. President?  Because I want to ask about Egypt. President Obama:  Ill be very quick.  What you just heard Governor Romney said is he doesnt have different ideas, and thats because were doing exactly what we should be doing to try to promote a moderate Syrian leadership and an effective transition so that we get Assad out.  Thats the kind of leadership weve shown.  Thats the kind of leadership well continue to show. Mr. Schieffer:  May I ask you, during the Egyptian turmoil, there came a point when you said it was time for President Mubarak to go. President Obama:  Right. Mr. Schieffer:  Some in your administration thought perhaps we should have waited a while on that.  Do you have any regrets about that?  President Obama:  No, I dont, because I think that America has to stand with democracy.  The notion that we would have tanks run over those young people who were in Tahrir Square -- that is not the kind of American leadership that John F. Kennedy talked about 50 years ago.  But what Ive also said is that now that you have a democratically elected government in Egypt, they have to make sure that they take responsibility for protecting religious minorities -- and we have put significant pressure on them to make sure theyre doing that; to recognize the rights of women, which is critical throughout the region.  These countries cant develop if young women are not given the kind of education that they need.  They have to abide by their treaty with Israel.  That is a red line for us, because not only is Israels security at stake, but our security is at stake if that unravels. They have to make sure that theyre cooperating with us when it comes to counterterrorism.  And we will help them with respect to developing their own economy -- because ultimately, whats going to make the Egyptian revolution successful for the people of Egypt but also for the world is if those young people who gathered there are seeing opportunities.  Their aspirations are similar to young peoples here.  They want jobs.  They want to be able to make sure their kids are going to a good school.  They want to make sure that they have a roof over their heads and that they have the prospects of a better life in the future.  And so one of the things that weve been doing is, for example, organizing entrepreneurship conferences with these Egyptians to give them a sense of how they can start rebuilding their economy in a way thats non-corrupt, thats transparent.  But what is also important for us to understand is, is that for America to be successful in this region, there are some things that were going to have to do here at home as well.  One of the challenges over the last decade is weve done experiments in nation-building in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, and weve neglected, for example, developing our own economy, our own energy sectors, our own education system.  And its very hard for us to project leadership around the world when were not doing what we need to do here. Mr. Schieffer:  Governor Romney, Im going to hear your response to that.  But I would just ask you, would you have stuck with Mubarak? Governor Romney:  No.  I believe, as the President indicated, and said at the time that I supported his action there.  I felt that -- I wish we would have had a better vision of the future.  I wish that, looking back at the beginning of the Presidents term and even further back than that, that we would have recognized that there was a growing energy and passion for freedom in that part of the world, and that we would have worked more aggressively with our friend and with other friends in the region to have them make the transition towards a more representative form of government, such that it didnt explode in the way it did.  But once it exploded, I felt the same as the President did, which is these freedom voices in the streets of Egypt were the people who were speaking of our principles.  And President Mubarak had done things which were unimaginable, and the idea of him crushing his people was not something that we could possibly support. Let me step back and talk about what I think our mission has to be in the Middle East and even more broadly -- because our purpose is to make sure the world is more -- is peaceful.  We want a peaceful planet.  We want people to be able to enjoy their lives and know theyre going to have a bright and prosperous future and not be at war.  Thats our purpose.  And the mantle of leadership for promoting the principles of peace has fallen to America.  We didnt ask for it, but its an honor that we have it.  But for us to be able to promote those principles of peace requires us to be strong, and that begins with a strong economy here at home.  And unfortunately, the economy is not stronger.  When the President of Iraq -- excuse me, of Iran, Ahmadinejad, says that our debt makes us not a great country, thats a frightening thing.  The former chief of -- the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that -- Admiral Mullen -- said that our debt is the biggest national security threat we face.  We have weakened our economy.  We need a strong economy.  We need to have, as well, a strong military.  Our military is second to none in the world.  Were blessed with terrific soldiers and extraordinary technology and intelligence.  But the idea of a trillion dollars in cuts through sequestration and budget cuts to the military would change that. We need to have strong allies.  Our association and connection with our allies is essential to Americas strength.  Were the great nation that has allies -- 42 allies and friends around the world.  And finally we have to stand by our principles.  And if were strong in each of those things, American influence will grow.  But, unfortunately, in nowhere in the world is Americas influence greater today than it was four years ago. Mr. Schieffer:  All right. Governor Romney:  And that's because weve become weaker -- President Obama:  Bob, I think -- Governor Romney:  -- on each of those four dimensions. Mr. Schieffer:  Youre going to get a chance to respond to that because that's a perfect segue into our next segment, and that is what is Americas role in the world.  And that is the question:  What do each of you see as our role in the world?  And I believe, Governor Romney, its your turn to go first. Governor Romney:  Well, I absolutely believe that America has a responsibility and the privilege of helping defend freedom and promote the principles that make the world more peaceful, and those principles include human rights, human dignity, free enterprise, freedom of expression, elections -- because when there are elections, people tend to vote for peace.  They don't vote for war.  So we want to promote those principles around the world.  We recognize that there are places of conflict in the world. We want to end those conflicts to the extent humanly possible.  But in order to be able to fulfill our role in the world, America must be strong.  America must lead.  And for that to happen, we have to strengthen our economy here at home.  You can't have 23 million people struggling to get a job.  You can't have an economy that over the last three years keeps slowing down in its growth rate.  You can't have kids coming out of college, half of whom can't find a job today, or a job that's commensurate with their college degree.  We have to get our economy going. And our military -- weve got to strengthen our military long term.  We don't know what the world is going to throw at us down the road.  We make decisions today in a military that will confront challenges we can't imagine.  In the 2000 debates, there was no mention of terrorism, for instance.  And a year later, 9/11 happened.  So we have to make decisions based upon uncertainty, and that means a strong military.  I will not cut our military budget. We have to also stand by our allies.  I think the tension that existed between Israel and the United States was very unfortunate.  I think also that pulling our missile defense program out of Poland in the way we did was also unfortunate in terms of, if you will, disrupting the relationship in some ways that existed between us. And then of course, with regards to standing for our principles, when the students took the streets in Tehran, and the people there protested, the Green Revolution occurred.  For the President to be silent, I thought was an enormous mistake.  We have to stand for our principles, stand for our allies, stand for a strong military and stand for a stronger economy. Mr. Schieffer:  Mr. President. President Obama:  America remains the one indispensible nation, and the world needs a strong America, and it is stronger now than when I came into office.  Because we ended the war in Iraq, we were able to refocus our attention on not only the terrorist threat, but also beginning a transition process in Afghanistan. It also allowed us to refocus on alliances and relationships that had been neglected for a decade.  And, Governor Romney, our alliances have never been stronger -- in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel, where we have unprecedented military and intelligence cooperation, including dealing with the Iranian threat.  But what we also have been able to do is position ourselves so we can start rebuilding America.  And thats what my plan does -- making sure that were bringing manufacturing back to our shores so that were creating jobs here, as weve done with the auto industry -- not rewarding companies that are shipping jobs overseas; making sure that weve got the best education system in the world, including retraining our workers for the jobs of tomorrow.  Doing everything we can to control our own energy.  Weve cut our oil imports to the lowest level in two decades because weve developed oil and natural gas, but we also have to develop clean energy technologies that will allow us to cut our exports in half by 2020.  Thats the kind of leadership that we need to show.  And weve got to make sure that we reduce our deficit.  Unfortunately, Governor Romneys plan doesnt do it.  Weve got to do it in a responsible way by cutting out spending we dont need, but also by asking the wealthiest to pay a little bit more. That way we can invest in the research and technology thats always kept us at the cutting edge. Now, Governor Romney has taken a different approach throughout this campaign.  Both at home and abroad, he has proposed wrong and reckless policies.  Hes praised George Bush as a good economic steward and Dick Cheney as somebody who shows great wisdom and judgment.  And taking us back to those kinds of strategies that got us into this mess are not the way that we are going to maintain leadership in the 21st century. Mr. Schieffer:  Governor Romney, wrong and reckless policies? Governor Romney:  Ive got the policy for a future, an agenda for the future.  And when it comes to our economy here at home, I know what it takes to create 12 million new jobs and rising take-home pay.  And what weve seen over the last four years is something I dont want to see over the next four years. The President said by now wed be at 5.4 percent unemployment.  Were 9 million jobs short of that.  I will get America working again and see rising take-home pay again, and Ill do it with five simple steps. Number one, we are going to have North American energy independence.  Were going to do it by taking full advantage of oil, coal, gas, nuclear, and our renewables.  Number two, were going to increase our trade.  Trade grows about 12 percent per year.  It doubles about every five or so years.  We can do better than that, particularly in Latin America.  The opportunities for us in Latin America we have just not taken advantage of fully.  As a matter of fact, Latin Americas economy is almost as big as the economy of China.  Were all focused on China.  Latin America is a huge opportunity for us -- time zone, language opportunities. Number three, were going to have to have training programs that work for our workers and schools that finally put the parents and the teachers and the kids first, and the teachers unions are going to have to go behind. And then were going to have to get to a balanced budget.  We cant expect entrepreneurs and businesses, large and small, to take their life savings or their companys money and invest in America if they think were headed to the road to Greece.  And thats where were going right now unless we finally get off this spending and borrowing binge.  And Ill get us on track to a balanced budget. And finally, number five, weve got to champion small business.  Small businesses are where jobs come from.  Two-thirds of our jobs come from small businesses.  New business formation is down at the lowest level in 30 years under this administration.  I want to bring it back and get back good jobs and rising take-home pay. President Obama:  Well, lets talk about what we need to compete.  First of all, Governor Romney talks about small businesses, but, Governor, when you were in Massachusetts, small businesses development ranked about 48th, I think, out of 50 states in Massachusetts because the policies that youre promoting actually dont help small businesses.  And the way you define small businesses include folks at the very top -- they include you and me.  Thats not the kind of small business promotion we need. But lets take an example that we know is going to make a difference in the 21st century, and thats our education policy. We didnt have a lot of chance to talk about this in the last debate.  Under my leadership, what weve done is reformed education, working with governors -- 46 states.  Weve seen progress and gains in schools that were having a terrible time, and theyre starting to finally make progress.  And what I now want to do is to hire more teachers, especially in math and science, because we know that weve fallen behind when it comes to math and science.  And those teachers can make a difference. Now, Governor Romney, when you were asked by teachers whether or not this would help the economy grow, you said this isnt going to help the economy grow.  When you were asked about reduced class sizes, you said class sizes dont make a difference.  But I tell you, if you talk to teachers, they will tell you it does make a difference.  And if weve got math teachers who are able to provide the kind of support that they need for our kids, thats whats going to determine whether or not the new businesses are created here.  Companies are going to locate here depending on whether weve got the most highly skilled workforce.  And the kinds of budget proposals that youve put forward, when we dont ask either you or me to pay a dime more in terms of reducing the deficit, but instead we slash support for education, thats undermining our long-term competitiveness.  That is not good for Americas position in the world -- and the world notices. Mr. Schieffer:  Let me get back to foreign policy. Governor Romney:  Well, look -- Mr. Schieffer:  Can I just get back to -- Governor Romney:  Well, I need to speak a moment if youll let me, Bob -- Mr. Schieffer::  Okay. Governor Romney:  -- just about education, because Im so proud of the state that I had the chance to be governor of.  We have, every two years, tests that look at how well our kids are doing.  Fourth-graders and eighth-graders are tested in English and math.  While I was governor, I was proud that our fourth-graders came out number one of all 50 states in English and then also in math, and our eighth-graders number one in English and also in math.  First time one state had been number one in all four measures. How did we do that?  Well, Republicans and Democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education principles that focused on having great teachers in the classroom, and that was -- President Obama:  Ten years earlier, Governor. Governor Romney:  -- and that was what allowed us to become the number-one state in the nation. President Obama:  But that was 10 years before you took office. Governor Romney:  And this is -- and we were -- Mr. Schieffer:  Gentlemen. Governor Romney:  Absolutely -- President Obama:  And then you cut education spending when you came into office. Governor Romney:  The first -- and we kept our schools number one in the nation.  Theyre still number one today. Mr. Schieffer:  All right. Governor Romney:  And the principles that we put in place -- we also gave kids not just a graduation exam that determined whether they were up to the skills needed to be able to compete, but also if they graduated in the top quarter of their class they got a four-year, tuition-free ride at any Massachusetts public institution of higher learning. President Obama:  That happened before you came into office, though. Mr. Schieffer:  Governor -- Governor Romney:  That was actually mine.  Actually, Mr. President, youve got that fact wrong. Mr. Schieffer:  Let me just -- I want to try to shift it, because we have heard some of this in the other debates.  Governor, you say you want a bigger military, you want a bigger Navy.  You dont want to cut defense spending.  What I want to ask you -- were talking about financial problems in this country -- where are you going to get the money? Governor Romney:  Well, lets come back and talk about the military, but all the way through.  First of all, Im going through from the very beginning -- were going to cut about 5 percent of the discretionary budget, excluding military.  Thats number one, all right?  And thats -- Mr. Schieffer:  But can you do this without driving us deeper into debt? Governor Romney:  The good news is -- Ill be happy to have you take a look.  Come on our website; youll look at how we get to a balanced budget within 8 to 10 years.  We do it by getting  -- by reducing spending in a whole series of programs.  By the way, number one I get rid of is Obamacare.  There are a number of things that sound good, but, frankly, we just cant afford them, and that one doesnt sound good and its not affordable.  So I get rid of that one from day one.  To the extent humanly possible, we get that out.  We take program after program that we dont absolutely have to have and we get rid of them. Number two, we take some programs that we are going to keep, like Medicaid, which is a program for the poor -- we take that health care program for the poor and we give it to the states to run because states run these programs more efficiently.  As a governor, I thought, please, give me this program.  I can run this more efficiently than the federal government. Mr. Schieffer:  Can he do that?", "filename": "23October2012ThirdPresidentialCandidateDebatewithMittRomney.txt"}, {"question": "But what you cant do is spend $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military is not asking for; $5 trillion on tax cuts.  You say that youre going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions without naming what those loopholes and deductions are, and then somehow youre also going to deal with the deficit that weve already got.  The math simply doesnt work.  But when it comes to our military, what we have to think about is not just budgets.  Weve got think about capabilities.  We need to be thinking about cybersecurity.  We need to be thinking about space.  That's exactly what our budget does, but its driven by strategy.  Its not driven by politics.  Its not driven by members of Congress and what they would like to see.  Its driven by what are we going to need to keep the American people safe.  That's exactly what our budget does. And it also then allows us to reduce our deficit, which is a significant national security concern, because weve got to make sure that our economy is strong at home so that we can project military power overseas. Governor Romney:  Bob, Im pleased that Ive balanced budgets.  I was in the world of business for 25 years.  You didn't balance your budget, you went out of business.  I went to the Olympics that was out of balance, and we got it on balance and made a success there.  I had the chance to be governor of our state; four years in a row, Democrats and Republicans came together to balance the budget.  We cut taxes 19 times, balanced our budget.  The President hasnt balanced a budget yet.  I expect to have the opportunity to do so myself.  Im going to be able to balance the budget. Lets talk about military spending, and that's this -- our Navy -- Mr. Schieffer:  Thirty seconds. Governor Romney:  Our Navy is old -- excuse me, our Navy is smaller now than any time since 1917.  The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission; were now down to 285.  Were headed down to the low 200s if we go through with  sequestration.  That's unacceptable to me.  I want to make sure that we have the ships that are required by our Navy.  Our Air Force is older and smaller than any time since it was founded in 1947.  Weve changed for the first time since FDR -- since FDR, we had the -- weve always had the strategy of saying we could fight in two conflicts at once.  Now were changing to one conflict.  Look, this, in my view, is the highest responsibility of the President of the United States, which is to maintain the safety of the American people.  And I will not cut our military budget by a trillion dollars, which is the combination of the budget cuts the President has, as well as the sequestration cuts.  That, in my view, is making our future less certain and less secure -- President Obama:  Bob, I just need to comment on this.  First of all, the sequester is not something that I proposed.  Its something that Congress has proposed.  It will not happen.  The budget that were talking about is not reducing our military spending, its maintaining it.  But I think Governor Romney maybe hasnt spent enough time looking at how our military works.  You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916.  Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed.  We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them.  We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.  And so the question is not a game of Battleship where were counting ships; its what are our capabilities. And so when I sit down with the Secretary of the Navy and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, we determine how are we going to be best able to meet all of our defense needs in a way that also keeps faith with our troops, that also makes sure that our veterans have the kind of support that they need when they come home.  And that is not reflected in the kind of budget that youre putting forward, because it just doesnt work.  And we visited the website quite a bit and it still doesnt work. Mr. Schieffer:  A lot to cover.  Id like to move to the next segment:  Red lines -- Israel and Iran.  Would either of you -- and youll have two minutes -- and, President Obama, you have the first go at this one.  Would either of you be willing to declare that an attack on Israel is an attack on the United States -- which, of course, is the same promise that we give to our close allies like Japan.  And if you made such a declaration, would not that deter Iran?  Its certainly deterred the Soviet Union for a long, long time when we made that promise to our allies. Mr. President. President Obama:  First of all, Israel is a true friend; it is our greatest ally in the region.  And if Israel is attacked, America will stand with Israel.  Ive made that clear throughout my presidency.  Mr. Schieffer:  So youre saying weve already made that declaration? President Obama:  I will stand with Israel if they are attacked.  And this is the reason why, working with Israel, we have created the strongest military and intelligence cooperation between our two countries in history.  In fact, this week, well be carrying out the largest military exercise with Israel in history -- this very week.  But to the issue of Iran, as long as Im President of the United States, Iran will not get a nuclear weapon.  I made that clear when I came into office.  We then organized the strongest coalition and the strongest sanctions against Iran in history, and it is crippling their economy.  Their currency has dropped 80 percent.  Their oil production has plunged to the lowest level since they were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years ago.  So their economy is in shambles.  And the reason we did this is because a nuclear Iran is a threat to our national security and its a threat to Israels national security.  We cannot afford to have a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world.  Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism, and for them to be able to provide nuclear technology to non-state actors, thats unacceptable.  And they have said that they want to see Israel wiped off the map. So the work that weve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice:  They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program, or they will have to face a united world and a United States President -- me -- who said were not going to take any options off the table. The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign, hes often talked as if we should take premature military action.  I think that would be a mistake, because when Ive sent young men and women into harms way, I always understand that that is the last resort, not the first resort. Mr. Schieffer:  Two minutes. Governor Romney:  Well, first of all, I want to underscore the same point the President made, which is that if Im President of the United States -- when Im President of the United States, we will stand with Israel.  And if Israel is attacked, we have their back, not just diplomatically, not just culturally, but militarily.  Thats number one. Number two, with regards to Iran and the threat of Iran -- theres no question but that a nuclear Iran, a nuclear-capable Iran is unacceptable to America.  It presents a threat not only to our friends, but ultimately a threat to us to have Iran have nuclear material, nuclear weapons that could be used against us or used to be threatening to us. Its also essential for us to understand what our mission is in Iran, and that is to dissuade Iran from having a nuclear weapon through peaceful and diplomatic means.  And crippling sanctions are something I called for five years ago -- when I was in Israel speaking at the Herzliya conference, I laid out seven steps.  Crippling sanctions were number one and they do work.  Youre seeing it right now in the economy.  Its absolutely the right thing to do to have crippling sanctions.  Id have put them in place earlier, but its good that we have them. Number two, something I would add today is I would tighten those sanctions.  I would say that ships that carry Iranian oil cant come into our ports.  I imagine the EU would agree with us as well.  Not only ships couldnt, Id say companies that are moving their oil cant; people who are trading in their oil cant.  I would tighten those sanctions further. Secondly, Id take on diplomatic isolation efforts.  Id make sure that Ahmadinejad is indicted under the genocide convention.  His words amount to genocide in citation.  I would indict him for it.  I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah they are around the world -- the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.  We need to increase pressure time and time again on Iran because anything other than a solution to this which says -- which stops this nuclear folly of theirs is unacceptable to America.  And of course, a military action is the last resort.  It is something one would only -- only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent. Mr. Schieffer:  Let me ask both of you, there are -- as you know, there are reports that Iran and the United States as part of an international group have agreed in principle to talks about Irans nuclear program.  What is the deal -- if there are such talks, what is the deal that you would accept? Mr. President. President Obama:  Well, first of all, those are reports in the newspaper.  They are not true.  But our goal is to get Iran to recognize it needs to give up its nuclear program and abide by the U.N. resolutions that have been in place -- because they have the opportunity to reenter the community of nations.  And we would welcome that.  There are people in Iran who have the same aspirations as people all around the world for a better life.  And we hope that their leadership takes the right decision.  But the deal well accept is they end their nuclear program.  Its very straightforward.  And Im glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that were taking.  There have been times, Governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign where it sounded like you thought that youd do the same things we did, but youd say them louder and somehow that would make a difference.  And it turns out that the work involved in setting up these crippling sanctions is painstaking.  Its meticulous.  We started from the day we got into office.  And the reason it was so important -- and this is a testament to how weve restored American credibility and strength around the world -- is we had to make sure that all the countries participated, even countries like Russia and China, because if its just us that are imposing sanctions, weve had sanctions in place for a long time. Its because we got everybody to agree that Iran is seeing so much pressure.  And weve got to maintain that pressure.  There is a deal to be had, and that is that they abide by the rules that have already been established; they convince the international community they are not pursuing a nuclear program; there are inspections that are very intrusive, but over time what they can do is regain credibility. In the meantime, though, were not going to let up the pressure until we have clear evidence that that takes place. And one last thing, just to make this point -- the clock is ticking.  Were not going to allow Iran to perpetually engage in negotiations that lead nowhere.  And Ive been very clear to them.  Because of the intelligence coordination that we do with a range of countries, including Israel, we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity, which means that we would not be able to intervene in time to stop their nuclear program.  And that clock is ticking. Mr. Schieffer:  All right. President Obama:  And were going to make sure that if they do not meet the demands of the international community, then we are going to take all options necessary to make sure they don't have a nuclear weapon. Mr. Schieffer:  Governor. Governor Romney:  I think from the very beginning, one of the challenges weve had with Iran is that they have looked at this administration and felt that the administration was not as strong as it needed to be.  I think they saw weakness where they had expected to find American strength.  And I say that because from the very beginning, the President, in his campaign some four years ago, said hed meet with all the worlds worst actors in his first year.  Hed sit down with Chavez and Kim Jong-il, with Castro and with President Ahmadinejad of Iran.  And I think they looked and thought, well, that's an unusual honor to receive from the President of the United States. And then the President began what Ive called an apology tour of going to various nations in the Middle East and criticizing America.  I think they looked at that and saw weakness.  Then when there were dissidents in the streets of Tehran, a Green Revolution, holding signs saying, is America with us, the President was silent.  I think they noticed that as well. And I think that when the President said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and Israel, that they noticed that as well.  All of these things suggested, I think, to the Iranian mullahs that, hey, we can keep on pushing along here, we can keep talks going on, were just going to keep on spinning centrifuges. Now there are some 10,000 centrifuges spinning uranium, preparing to create a nuclear threat to the United States and to the world. Thats unacceptable for us.  And its essential for a President to show strength from the very beginning, to make it very clear what is acceptable and not acceptable.  And an Iranian nuclear program is not acceptable to us.  They must not develop nuclear capability.  And the way to make sure they understand that is by having from the very beginning the tightest sanctions possible.  They need to be tightened.  Our diplomatic isolation needs to be tougher.  We need to indict Ahmadinejad.  We need to put the pressure on them as hard as we possibly can, because if we do that, we wont have to take the military action. President Obama:  Bob, let me just respond.  Nothing Governor Romney just said is true, starting with this notion of me apologizing.  This has been probably the biggest whopper thats been told during the course of this campaign.  And every fact-checker and every reporter whos looked at it, Governor, has said this is not true.  And when it comes to tightening sanctions, look, as I said before, weve put in the toughest, most crippling sanctions ever. And the fact is, while we were coordinating an international coalition to make sure these sanctions were effective, you were still invested in a Chinese state oil company that was doing business with the Iranian oil sector.  So Ill let the American people decide, judge who is going to be more effective and more credible when it comes to imposing crippling sanctions. And with respect to our attitude about the Iranian Revolution, I was very clear about the murderous activities that had taken place and that was contrary to international law and everything that civilized people stand for.  And so the strength that we have shown in Iran is shown by the fact that weve been able to mobilize the world. When I came into office, the world was divided; Iran was resurgent.  Iran is at its weakest point economically, strategically, militarily, than in many years.  And we are going to continue to keep the pressure on to make sure that they do not get a nuclear weapon.  Thats in Americas national interest, and that will be the case so long as Im President. Governor Romney:  Were four years closer to a nuclear Iran. Were four years closer to a nuclear Iran.  And we should not have wasted these four years to the extent theyve continued to be able to spin these centrifuges and get that much closer.  Thats number one. Number two, Mr. President, the reason I call it an apology tour is because you went to the Middle East and you flew to Egypt and to Saudi Arabia and to Turkey and Iraq, and -- and, by the way, you skipped Israel, our closest friend in the region, but you went to the other nations.  And, by the way, they noticed that you skipped Israel.  And then in those nations, and on Arabic TV, you said that America had been dismissive and derisive.  You said that on occasion America has dictated to other nations.  Mr. President, America has not dictated to other nations.  We have freed other nations from dictator. President Obama: Bob, let me respond.  If were going to talk about trips that weve taken -- when I was a candidate for office, the first trip I took was to visit our troops.  And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didnt take donors, I didnt attend fundraisers.  I went to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.  And then I went down to the border town of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining down from Hamas.  And I saw families there who showed me where missiles had come down near their childrens bedrooms, and I was reminded of what that would mean if those were my kids -- which is why, as President, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those missiles.  So thats how Ive used my travels, when I traveled to Israel and when I traveled to the region.  And the central question at this point is going to be whos going to be credible to all parties involved.  And they can look at my track record -- whether its Irans sanctions, whether its dealing with counterterrorism, whether its supporting democracy, whether its supporting womens rights, whether its supporting religious minorities -- and they can say that the President of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of history.  And that kind of credibility is precisely why weve been able to show leadership on a wide range of issues facing the world right now. Mr. Schieffer:  What if the Prime Minister of Israel called you on the phone and said, Our bombers are on the way.  Were going to bomb Iran -- what do you say? Governor Romney:  Bob, lets not go into hypotheticals of that nature.  Our relationship with Israel, my relationship with the Prime Minister of Israel is such that we would not get a call saying our bombers are on the way or their fighters are on the way.  This is the kind of thing that would have been discussed and thoroughly evaluated well before that kind of last minute -- Mr. Schieffer:  So youre saying -- Governor Romney:  Im just saying thats just not -- Mr. Schieffer:  Okay, well, lets see what -- Governor Romney:  Lets come back to what the President was speaking about, which is whats happening in the world, and the Presidents statement that things are going so well.  Look, I look at whats happening around the world and I see Iran four years closer to a bomb.  I see the Middle East with a rising tide of violence, chaos, tumult.  I see jihadists continuing to spread -- whether theyre rising or just about the same level, hard to precisely measure but its clear theyre there.  Theyre very strong.  I see Syria with 30,000 civilians dead.  Assad is still in power.  I see our trade deficit with China larger than its -- growing larger every year, as a matter of fact.  I look around the world and I dont feel that -- you see North Korea continuing to export their nuclear technology.  Russia has said theyre not going to follow Nunn-Lugar anymore.  Theyre -- back away from a nuclear proliferation treaty that we had with them.  I look around the world -- I dont see our influence growing around the world.  I see our influence receding -- in part because of the failure of the President to deal with our economic challenges at home; in part because of our withdrawal from our commitment to our military in the way I think it ought to be; in part because of the turmoil with Israel.  I mean, the President received a letter from 38 Democrat senators saying that tensions with Israel were a real problem.  They asked him, please repair the tension -- Democrat senators -- please repair the damage in his own party. President Obama:  All right, Governor, the problem is, is that on a whole range of issues -- whether its the Middle East, whether its Afghanistan, whether its Iraq, whether its now Iran -- youve been all over the map.  I mean, Im pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear program. But just a few years ago, you said thats something youd never do.  In the same way that you initially opposed a timetable in Afghanistan; now youre for it, although it depends.  In the same way that you say you would have ended the war in Iraq, but recently gave a speech saying that we should have 20,000 more folks in there.  The same way that you said that it was mission creep to go after Qaddafi. When it comes to going after Osama bin Laden, you said, well, any President would make that call.  But when you were a candidate in 2008 -- as I was -- and I said if I got bin Laden in our sights, I would take that shot, you said we shouldnt move heaven and earth to get one man.  You said we should ask Pakistan for permission.  And if we had asked Pakistan for permission, we would not have gotten it [him].  And it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him  After we killed bin Laden, I was at Ground Zero for a memorial and talked to a young woman who was four years old when 9/11 happened.  And the last conversation she had with her father was him calling from the Twin Towers, saying, Peyton, I love you, and I will always watch over you.  And for the next decade she was haunted by that conversation.  And she said to me, By finally getting bin Laden, that brought some closure to me.  And when we do things like that, when we bring those who have harmed us to justice, that sends a message to the world, and it tells Peyton that we did not forget her father. Mr. Schieffer:  All right. President Obama:  And I make that point because thats the kind of clarity of leadership -- and those decisions are not always popular.  Those decisions generally are not poll-tested.  And even some in my own party, including my current Vice President, had the same critique as you did.  But what the American people understand is, is that I look at what we need to get done to keep the American people safe and to move our interests forward, and I make those decisions. Mr. Schieffer:  All right, lets go and that leads us -- this takes us right to the next segment, Governor, Americas longest war, Afghanistan and Pakistan -- Governor Romney:  Bob -- Mr. Schieffer:  Governor, you get to go first here. Governor Romney:  You cant -- okay, but you cant have the President just lay out a whole series of items without giving me a chance to respond. Mr. Schieffer:  Well, with respect, sir, you had laid out quite a program there.  Governor Romney:  Well, that's probably true. Mr. Schieffer:  And well give you -- well give you -- President Obama:  Well agree -- Mr. Schieffer:  Well catch up.  The United States is scheduled to turn over responsibility for security in Afghanistan to the Afghan government in 2014.  At that point we will withdraw our combat troops, leave a smaller force of Americans -- if I understand our policy -- in Afghanistan for training purposes.  It seems to me the key question here is what do you do if the deadline arrives and it is obvious the Afghans are unable to handle their security?  Do we still leave?  And I believe, Governor Romney, you go first. Governor Romney:  Well, were going to be finished by 2014. And when Im President, well make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014.  The commanders and the generals there are on track to do so.  Weve seen progress over the last several years. The surge has been successful, and the training program is proceeding apace.  There are a large number of Afghan security forces -- 350,000 -- that are ready to step in to provide security, and were going to be able to make that transition by the end of 2014.  So our troops will come home at that point. I can tell you at the same time that we will make sure that we look at whats happening in Pakistan and recognize that whats happening in Pakistan is going to have a major impact on the success in Afghanistan.  And I say that because I know a lot of people just feel like we should brush our hands and walk away -- and I don't mean you, Mr. President -- but some people in our nation feel that Pakistan isnt being nice to us and that we should just walk away from them. Pakistan is important to the region, to the world, and to us, because Pakistan has a hundred nuclear warheads, and they're rushing to build a lot more.  Theyll have more than Great Britain sometime in the relatively near future.  They also have the Haqqani Network and the Taliban existent within their country.  And so a Pakistan that falls apart, becomes a failed state, would be of extraordinary danger to Afghanistan and to us.  And so were going to have to remain helpful in encouraging Pakistan to move towards a more stable government and rebuild a relationship with us.  And that means that our aid that we provide to Pakistan is going to have to be conditioned upon certain benchmarks being met.  So for me, I look at this as both a need to help move Pakistan in the right direction and also to get Afghanistan to be ready, and they will be ready by the end of 2014. Mr. Schieffer:  Mr. President. President Obama:  When I came into office, we were still bogged down in Iraq, and Afghanistan had been drifting for a decade.  We ended the war in Iraq, refocused our attention on Afghanistan.  And we did deliver a surge of troops.  That was facilitated in part because we had ended the war in Iraq.  And we are now in a position where we have met many of the objectives that got us there in the first place. Part of what had happened is we had forgotten why we had gone.  We went because there were people who were responsible for 3,000 American deaths.  And so we decimated al Qaedas core leadership in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.  We then started to build up Afghan forces, and we're now in a position where we can transition out, because theres no reason why Americans should die when Afghans are perfectly capable of defending their own country. That transition has to take place in a responsible fashion. Weve been there a long time, but weve got to make sure that we and our coalition partners are pulling out responsibly and giving Afghans the capabilities that they need. But what I think the American people recognize is after a decade of war, its time to do some nation-building here at home. And what we can now do is free up some resources to, for example, put Americans back to work -- especially our veterans -- rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our schools; making sure that our veterans are getting the care that they need when it comes to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury; making sure that the certifications that they need for good jobs of the future are in place.  I was having lunch with some -- a veteran in Minnesota who had been a medic dealing with the most extreme circumstances.  When he came home and he wanted to become a nurse, he had to start from scratch.  And what weve said is lets change those certifications.  The First Lady has done great work with an organization called Joining Forces, putting our veterans back to work.  And as a consequence, veterans unemployment is actually now lower than the general population; it was higher when I came into office. So those are the kinds of things that we can now do because were making that transition in Afghanistan. Mr. Schieffer:  All right, let me go to Governor Romney, because you talked about Pakistan and what needs to be done there.  General Allen, our commander in Afghanistan, says that Americans continue to die at the hands of groups who are supported by Pakistan.  We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama [sic] -- bin Laden.  It still provides safe haven for terrorists.  Yet we continue to give Pakistan billions of dollars.  Is it time for us to divorce Pakistan? Governor Romney:  No, its not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the way to double that at some point; a nation that has serious threats from terrorist groups within its nation -- as I indicated before, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network.  Its a nation thats not like others and it does not have a civilian leadership that is calling the shots there.  Youve got the ISI, their intelligence organization, thats probably the most powerful of three branches there.  Then you have the military and then you have the civilian government. This is a nation which, if it falls apart, if it becomes a failed state, there are nuclear weapons there, and youve got terrorists there who could grab their hands onto those nuclear weapons.  This is an important part of the world for us.  Pakistan is technically an ally, and theyre not acting very much like an ally right now, but we have some work to do. And I dont blame the administration for the fact that the relationship with Pakistan is strained.  We had to go into Pakistan.  We had to go in there to get Osama bin Laden.  That was the right thing to do.  And that upset them, but there was obviously a great deal of anger even before that.  But were going to have to work with the people in Pakistan to try and help them move to a more responsible course than the one that theyre on.  Its important for them.  Its important for the nuclear weapons.  Its important for the success of Afghanistan, because inside Pakistan you have a large -- Pashtuns that are Taliban.  Theyre going to come rushing back in to Afghanistan when we go, and thats one of the reasons the Afghan security forces have so much work to do to be able to fight against that.  But its important for us to recognize that we cant just walk away from Pakistan.  But we do need to make sure that as we send support for them, that this is tied to them making progress on matters that would lead them to becoming a civil society. Mr. Schieffer:  Let me ask you, Governor -- because we know President Obamas position on this -- what is your position on the use of drones? Governor Romney:  Well, I believe that we should use any and all means necessary to take out people who pose a threat to us and our friends around the world.  And its widely reported that drones are being used in drone strikes, and I support that entirely, and feel the President was right to up the usage of that technology, and believe that we should continue to use it to continue to go after the people who represent a threat to this nation and to our friends. Let me also note that, as I said earlier, were going to have to do more than just going after leaders and killing bad guys, important as that is.  Were also going to have to have a far more effective and comprehensive strategy to help move the world away from terror and Islamic extremism.  We havent done that yet.  We talk a lot about these things, but you look at the record -- you look at the record of the last four years and say, is Iran closer to a bomb?  Yes.  Is the Middle East in tumult?  Yes.  Is al Qaeda on the run, on its heels?  No.  Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?  No, they havent had talks in two years.  We have not seen the progress we need to have.  And Im convinced that with strong leadership and an effort to build a strategy based upon helping these nations reject extremism, we can see the kind of peace and prosperity the world demands. President Obama:  Well, keep in mind, our strategy wasnt just going after bin Laden.  Weve created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism -- in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.  And what weve also done is engage these governments in the kind of reforms that are actually going to make a difference in peoples lives day to day -- to make sure that their governments arent corrupt; to make sure that they are treating women with the kind of respect and dignity that every nation that succeeds has shown; and to make sure that theyve got a free market system that works.  So across the board, we are engaging them in building capacity in these countries, and weve stood on the side of democracy.  One thing I think Americans should be proud of -- when Tunisians began to protest, this nation -- me, my administration -- stood with them earlier than just about any other country.  In Egypt, we stood on the side of democracy.  In Libya, we stood on the side of the people.  And as a consequence, theres no doubt that attitudes about Americans have changed.  But there are always going to be elements in these countries that potentially threaten the United States, and we want to shrink those groups and those networks, and we can do that.  But were always also going to have to maintain vigilance when it comes to terrorist activities.  The truth, though, is that al Qaeda is much weaker than it was when I came into office, and they dont have the same capacities to attack the U.S. homeland and our allies as they did four years ago. Mr. Schieffer:  Lets go to the next segment, because its a very important one.  It is the rise of China and future challenges for America.  I want to just begin this by asking both of you -- and, Mr. President, you go first this time -- what do you believe is the greatest future threat to the national security of this country? President Obama:  Well, I think it will continue to be terrorist networks.  We have to remain vigilant, as I just said. But with respect to China, China is both an adversary but also a potential partner in the international community if its following the rules.  So my attitude coming into office was that we are going to insist that China plays by the same rules as everybody else.  Now, I know Americans had seen jobs being shipped overseas, businesses and workers not getting a level playing field when it came to trade.  And thats the reason why I set up a trade task force to go after cheaters when it came to international trade.  Thats the reason why we have brought more cases against China for violating trade rules than the other -- the previous administration had done in two terms.  And weve won just about every case that we filed, that has been decided.  In fact, just recently, steel workers in Ohio and throughout the Midwest, Pennsylvania, are in a position now to sell steel to China because we won that case.  We had a tire case in which they were flooding us with cheap domestic tires -- or cheap Chinese tires -- and we put a stop to it and, as a consequence, saved jobs throughout America. I have to say that Governor Romney criticized me for being too tough in that tire case; said this wouldnt be good for American workers and that it would protectionist.  But I tell you, those workers dont feel that way.  They feel as if they had finally an administration who was going to take this issue seriously.  Over the long term, in order for us to compete with China, weve also got to make sure, though, that were taking care of business here at home.  If we dont have the best education system in the world, if we don't continue to put money into research and technology that will allow us to create great businesses here in the United States, thats how we lose the competition.  And unfortunately, Governor Romneys budget and his proposals would not allow us to make those investments. Mr. Schieffer:  All right.  Governor. Governor Romney:  Well, first of all, its not government that makes business successful.  Its not government investments that make businesses grow and hire people.  Let me also note that the greatest threat that the world faces, the greatest national security threat is a nuclear Iran. Lets talk about China.  China has an interest thats very much like ours in one respect, and that is they want a stable world.  They dont want war.  They dont want to see protectionism.  They dont want to see the world break out into various form of chaos, because they have to manufacture goods and put people to work.  They have about 20,000 -- 20 million, rather, people coming out of the farms every year, coming into the cities, needing jobs.  So they want the economy to work and the world to be free and open.  And so we can be a partner with China.  We dont have to be an adversary in any way, shape, or form.  We can work with them.  We can collaborate with them if they're willing to be responsible. Now, they look at us and say, is it a good idea to be with America?  How strong are we going to be?  How strong is our economy?  They look at the fact that we owe them a trillion dollars and owe other people $16 trillion in total, including them.  They look at our decision to cut back on our military capabilities -- a trillion dollars.  The Secretary of Defense called these trillion dollars of cuts to our military devastating.  Its not my term.  Its the Presidents own Secretary of Defense called them devastating.  They look at Americas commitments around the world and they see whats happening, and they say, well, okay, is America going to be strong?  And the answer is, yes, if Im President, America will be very strong. Well also make sure that we have trade relations with China that work for us.  Ive watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency; it holds down the prices of their goods.  It means our goods arent as competitive, and we lose jobs.  That's got to end.  They're making some progress.  They need to make more.  That's why on day one I will label them a currency manipulator, which allows us to apply tariffs where they're taking jobs. They're stealing our intellectual property, our patents, our designs, our technology, hacking into our computers, counterfeiting our goods.  They have to understand we want to trade with them, we want a world that's stable, we like free enterprise, but youve got to play by the rules. Mr. Schieffer:  Well, Governor, let me just ask you, if you declare them a currency manipulator on day one, some people say youre just going to start a trade war with China on day one.  Is that -- isnt there a risk that that could happen?", "filename": "23October2012ThirdPresidentialCandidateDebatewithMittRomney.txt"}, {"question": "The Japan-U.S. alliance has been revived very strongly.  And the nature of our talks this time was such that we were able to demonstrate this both inside and outside of the country.  Barack said this before -- to create a large economic zone in the Asia Pacific would bring about major benefits to Japan, the United States, and to the Asian nations.  The TPP was indeed a very farsighted plan.  As a result of serious exchanges between Barack and myself, Japan was able to make the transition to the next stage, which was to participate in the TPP talks.  Its been one year since then and Japan along with the United States is in a role to lead in a major way the TPP talks.  To make the talks between the two leaders a milestone and so as to resolve pending issues between our two countries, Minister Amari and U.S. Trade Representative Ambassador Froman decided that they would energetically and earnestly continue the talks.  President Obama and I instructed the ministers to continue these talks so as to bring to a conclusion the remaining issues and so as to bring about a major conclusion of the TPP talks as a whole.  Today and tomorrow, the talks will continue.  So the joint statement released will see the result of this and we will formulate a joint statement after this.  Between Japan and the United States, we share values such as freedom, democracy, human rights and rule of law.  We have shared these basic values and strategic interests.  We are global partners.  So we have this partnership and this strong alliance between our two countries.  Its the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in the Asia Pacific region.  Japan espouses the principle of proactive contribution to peace.  And the United States is moving forward with its policy of pivoting to the Asia Pacific.  These are contributing to peace and stability in the region.  And we mutually appreciated and welcomed each others policies.  Having done so between Barack and myself, we were able to confirm that the Japan-U.S. alliance would play a leading role in ensuring peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific.  This is what I wanted to communicate to you.  With regard to security, including the review of the Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation guidelines1, wide-ranging security and defensive cooperation would be promoted.  We agreed on this point.  With regard to the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan, including the transfer of U.S. Marines in Okinawa to Guam and relocation of the Futenma Air Station, we would make steady progress on this front.  And we reaffirmed the resolve on both sides to make this transpire.  Okinawa Governor Nakaima has requested termination of the operation of the Futenma Air Station in five years or less.  With regard to this and other requests by the Governor, I explained this to President Barack and requested further cooperation from the United States to alleviate the impact on Okinawa.   With regard to various issues which the international society is facing, we had a heart-to-heart talk between Barack and myself.  On the situation in Ukraine, changing the status quo against the backdrop of coercion and intimidation would not be condoned.  We confirmed this point once again, and the importance to providing support to Ukraine and to cooperate between Japan and the G7 is something that we agreed on. With regard to China, based on the rule of law, a free and open Asia Pacific region will be developed and we would try to engage China in this region.  And we agreed to cooperate toward this end.  With regard to moves to try to change the status quo through coercion and intimidation, we agreed that we would clearly oppose such news.  Going forward with regard to policies vis--vis China, we agreed to maintain close cooperation between Japan and the United States.  This was confirmed. On the DPRK, we confirmed that close cooperation between the U.S., Japan and ROK would continue to be important.  And this time Barack made the time to meet with the Yokotas and Mr. Iizuka.  At our talks, I requested understanding, and continued understanding and cooperation toward the resolution of the abduction issue and the President expressed his support.  This month I met three times with Ambassador Kennedy.  I had this honor.  We discussed space, linear and cultural exchanges, and so this is a manifestation of the best of the cooperative relationship which exists between our two countries.  In the talks between the leaders, I put forth once again the proposal to introduce Maglev technology in the United States.  We had an exchange of views with regard to energy cooperation, and inclusive of a society where women can shine, and global issues. We agreed that we would cooperate on these issues.  Ambassador Kennedy is a symbol of the friendship which exists between our two countries and the bonds which exist.  Id like to cooperate even more closely with the Ambassador to further deepen cooperative relations between our two countries. Going forward, what supports the alliance are the youth in both of our countries.  To further enhance exchanges between youth I have told Barack of our plans to send 6,000 Japanese students to the United States this fiscal year.  The Japan-U.S. alliance is more robust than ever before.  Barack, you talked about the sushi you had last night and you said it was the best you had in your life.  We had heart-to-heart talks for an hour and a half.  We talked about issues between our two countries and challenges of the world.  We confirmed the bonds and the roles of our two countries and we talked about further potential of the relationship between our two countries.  It was a very enriching and satisfactory time.  And the sushi I had yesterday, for me, too, was the best I had in my life so far, and it is without a doubt that this is the case. So, between Barack and I, we want to make U.S.-Japan relations more favorable than ever before.  And that is all for me.  Thank you. President Obama:  Konnichiwa.  I want to thank Prime Minister Abe for your kind words and your warm welcome, as well as the outstanding sushi and sake yesterday.  It is wonderful to be back in Japan.  This is my third visit as President.  Im deeply honored to be making the first state visit by a U.S. President in nearly two decades.  Im grateful to Their Majesties, the Emperor and Empress, for their gracious welcome this morning.  And I've once again been touched by the kindness and hospitality of the Japanese people -- your omotenashi.  Ive said many times the United States is and always will be a Pacific nation.  Americas security and prosperity is inseparable from the future of this region, and thats why Ive made it a priority to renew American leadership in the Asia Pacific.  And the cornerstone of our strategy -- and the foundation of the regions security and economic progress -- is our historic treaty alliances, including with Japan.  Prime Minister Abe, I want to thank you for your exceptional commitment to our alliance, which in recent years has grown even stronger.  Under your leadership, Japan is also looking to make even greater contributions to peace and security around the world, which the United States very much welcomes.  And last night we had an excellent discussion on a whole range of issues.  We agreed to continue deepening our security cooperation.  We continue to make progress towards realigning our forces in the region, including Okinawa, which will lessen the impact of our bases on local communities.  As we modernize our defense posture in the region, our forces in Japan will include our most advanced military capabilities.  We stand together in calling for disputes in the region, including maritime issues, to be resolved peacefully through dialogue.  We share a commitment to fundamental principles such as freedom of navigation and respect for international law.  And let me reiterate that our treaty commitment to Japans security is absolute, and Article 5 covers all territories under Japans administration, including the Senkaku Islands. Our two nations are united along with the Republic of Korea in our determination to bring about the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and in our firm response to North Koreas provocations.  And we stand with Japan as it seeks to resolve the tragedy of North Koreas abductions of Japanese citizens.  Beyond Northeast Asia, Japan and the United States are working together to enhance our economic and diplomatic and security coordination with our ASEAN partners in Southeast Asia. Were deepening our cooperation as global partners, from the relief we delivered together after the typhoon in the Philippines last year to our unified response to Russias military intervention in Ukraine.   We made important progress in the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, which will support good jobs and growth in the United States as well as economic reform and revitalization here in Japan.  Were closer to agreement on issues like automobiles and agriculture.  Ive been very clear and honest that American manufacturers and farmers need to have meaningful access to markets that are included under TPP, including here in Japan.  Thats what will make it a good deal for America -- for our workers and our consumers, and our families.  Thats my bottom line, and I cant accept anything less. At the same time, Prime Minister Abe is committed to renewing Japans economy, and TPP is a vital part of that.  As Ive told Shinzo, Japan has the opportunity -- in part through TPP -- to play a key leadership role in the Asia Pacific region for this century.  So now is the time for bold steps that are needed to reach a comprehensive agreement, and I continue to believe we can get this done. I would add that our countries are more prosperous when we tap the talents of all of our citizens.  So I want to commend the Prime Minister for his commitment to bringing more women into the work force.  And because our economic security also depends on energy security, were going to keep working together on clean and efficient alternatives to fossil fuels both at home and abroad that can power the global economy while combating climate change.  Finally, Im pleased that we continue to deepen the extraordinary ties between our people, especially our young people, like the Japanese students that Ill be meeting later today.  And Im proud to announce that were launching a new program that will help even more Japanese students come to the United States to improve their English-language skills and gain valuable experience working in American businesses and organizations.  And thats part of our effort to double student exchanges by 2020 -- bonds among our young people that can bring us closer together for decades to come.   So, Prime Minister Abe, thank you for your friendship, your partnership, and the progress that weve made together.  I want to thank you and the people of Japan for being such extraordinary allies.  Standing together, I have no doubt about what our nations can achieve.  So as you say here, ganbarou.  Thank you. Question:  Id like to raise a question with regard to security.  First, my question is addressed to Prime Minister Abe.  President Obama, with regard to the defense of the Senkaku Islands, he had clearly stated his security stance based on the security treaty. And what kind of discussion did you have on the exercise of collective security rights?  To President Obama, the following question:  Based on the security treaty, the obligation to defend the Senkaku Islands, this is the first time that you referred to this issue.  Why did you mention this?  Could you talk about the import of your statement? Prime Minister Abe:  [As interpreted.]  Through the talks with President Obama, as President Obama mentioned at the outset in his speech, between our two countries we have the security treaty and under the security treaty, all of the abilities and capabilities to perform the commitment is provided.  And this includes all territories under the administration of Japan, inclusive of the Senkaku Islands.  And any unilateral action to undermine Japans administration of the Senkaku Islands will be opposed by the United States.  We agreed on this point. On the exercise of the right of collective defense, presently in Japan the legal basis for security is being discussed and with regard to the stability of Japan and regional safety and stability, and to function the alliance effectively, and to contribute to the stability of the region we are making these studies.  This is what I have explained to President Obama. Concerning such studies and examinations being made in Japan, this was welcomed and this would be supported.  That was the position expressed by President Obama.  President Obama:  Our position is not new.  Secretary Hagel, our Defense Secretary, when he visited here, Secretary of State John Kerry when he visited here, both indicated what has been our consistent position throughout.  We dont take a position on final sovereignty determinations with respect to Senkakus, but historically they have been administered by Japan and we do not believe that they should be subject to change unilaterally.  And what is a consistent part of the alliance is that the treaty covers all territories administered by Japan.  So this is not a new position, this is a consistent one. In our discussions, I emphasized with Prime Minister Abe the importance of resolving this issue peacefully -- not escalating the situation, keeping the rhetoric low, not taking provocative actions, and trying to determine how both Japan and China can work cooperatively together.  And I want to make that larger point.  We have strong relations with China.  They are a critical country not just to the region, but to the world.  Obviously, with a huge population, a growing economy, we want to continue to encourage the peaceful rise of China.  I think theres enormous opportunities for trade, development, working on common issues like climate change with China.  But what weve also emphasized -- and I will continue to emphasize throughout this trip -- is that all of us have responsibilities to help maintain basic rules of the road and an international order so that large countries, small countries, all have to abide by what is considered just and fair, and that we are resolving disputes in peaceful fashion.  And this is a message that Ive delivered directly to the Chinese and its one that I think is entirely consistent with China being successful.  I think the alternative is a situation in which large countries, like the United States or China or Russia or other countries, feel as if whenever they think its expedient they can take actions that disadvantage smaller countries, and thats not the kind of world that is going to be stable and prosperous and secure over the long term.  So we are invested in an international order, and that applies to a whole range of issues, including maritime issues.  My hope is, is that China will continue to engage with us and other countries in the region where we do not take a position on the particular sovereignty of this piece of land or this rock but we do take a position in making sure that all countries are following basic international procedures in resolving these disputes.  And if that happens, then I think not only will China be successful, but I think theres a great potential for Chinese and Japanese cooperation, Chinese and Vietnamese cooperation, cooperation with the Philippines and China -- all of which will benefit the peoples of the region. Mr. Carney:  The next question comes from Jim Acosta of CNN. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Arigato, Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, in regards to the Senkaku Islands, I just want to make sure that this is absolutely clear.  Are you saying that the U.S. would consider using military force were China to have some sort of military incursion in those islands to protect those islands?  And how does that not draw another red line that you would have to enforce -- of putting U.S. credibility, your credibility on the line once again, as it was in the case with Syria and Russia?  And on another key security issue, you mentioned North Korea in your meeting with the Prime Minister.  Are you issuing a warning to North Korea that there should not be another nuclear test? And to Prime Minister Abe, do you have confidence in President Obamas assurances about your security when the U.S. and the West were unable to stop Russias advances in Ukraine?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, Jim, let me unpack that question because theres a whole bunch of assumptions in there, some of which I dont agree with.  First of all, the treaty between the United States and Japan preceded my birth, so obviously, this isnt a red line that Im drawing; it is the standard interpretation over multiple administrations of the terms of the alliance, which is that territories under the administration of Japan are covered under the treaty.  Theres no shift in position.  Theres no red line thats been drawn.  Were simply applying the treaty. At the same time, as Ive said directly to the Prime Minister that it would be a profound mistake to continue to see escalation around this issue rather than dialogue and confidence-building measures between Japan and China.  And were going to do everything we can to encourage that diplomatically.  With respect to the other issues that you raise, our position, Jim, the United States position is that countries should abide by international law; that those laws, those rules, those norms are violated when you gas children, or when you invade the territory of another country.  Now, the implication of the question I think is, is that each and every time a country violates one of those norms the United States should go to war, or stand prepared to engage militarily, and if it doesnt then somehow were not serious about those norms.  Well, thats not the case. Right now, we have 87 percent of serious chemical weapons have already been removed from Syria.  Theres about 13 percent left.  Thats as a consequence of U.S. leadership.  And the fact that we didnt have to fire a missile to get that accomplished is not a failure to uphold those international norms, its a success.  Its not a complete success until we have the last 13 percent out.  With respect to Russia and Ukraine, weve been very clear about the fact that theres not going to be a military solution to the problem in Ukraine, but we have already applied sanctions that have had an impact on the Russian economy and we have continued to hold out the prospect, the possibility to resolve this issue diplomatically.  There was some possibility that Russia could take the wiser course after the meetings in Geneva. So far, at least, we have seen them not abide by the spirit or the letter of the agreement in Geneva.  And instead, we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, and destabilizing the region, and we havent seen Russia step up and discourage that.  On the other side, youve seen the government in Kyiv take very concrete steps, in introducing an amnesty law and offering a whole range of reforms with respect to the constitution, that are consistent with what was discussed in Geneva.  And my expectation is, is that if, once again, Russia fails to abide by both the spirit and the letter of what was discussed in Geneva, that there will be further consequences and we will ramp up further sanctions.  That doesnt mean that the problem is going to be solved right away.  These are difficult issues.  But what we try to do is to make sure that we are very clear about what we stand for, what we believe in, and we are willing to take actions on behalf of those values, those norms, and those ideals. Question:  And on North Korea? President Obama:  And the question was?  Question:  Is there a warning to North Korea to not conduct another nuclear test? President Obama:  North Korea has engaged in provocative actions for the last several decades.  Its been an irresponsible actor on the international stage for the last several decades.  So our message on North Korea has been consistent throughout.  They are the most isolated country in the world.  They are subject to more international sanctions and international condemnation than any country in the world.  As a consequence, their people suffer as much as any peoples in the world. And what weve said is if you are, in fact, serious about North Korea being a normal nation, then youve got to start changing your behavior.  And that starts with the basic principle of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.  Now, am I optimistic that theres going to be a major strategic shift in North Koreas attitudes any time soon?  Probably not.  But what I am confident about is, is that working with Japan, working with the Republic of Korea, and working with China and other interested parties in the region, that we can continue to apply more and more pressure on North Korea so that at some juncture they end up taking a different course. In the meantime, theyre dangerous, and we have to make sure that we are guarding against any provocations getting out of hand.  This is one of the reasons why the alliance is so important and collective self-defense is so important.  But we are not surprised when they engage in irresponsible behavior.  Thats been their pattern for the last couple of decades.  And what we have to do is to continue to try to contain and mitigate the potential damage that this behavior has and continue to put pressure on them so that we can see a shift. And Chinas participation in pushing the DPRK in a different direction is critically important as well.  They have not only an opportunity but I think a security interest and a broader interest in a peaceful resolution to what has been a generation-long conflict and is the most destabilizing, dangerous situation in all of the Asia Pacific region.  Prime Minister Abe:  [As interpreted.]  First of all, I would like to state the following:  The Japan-U.S. alliance is unwavering and its indispensable to maintain the Asia Pacific region peaceful and stable.  The Japan-U.S. alliance and the relationship and the strengthening thereof is very beneficial.  And to strengthen our bilateral relationship, you have tremendous enthusiasm.  I believe in that.  And your enthusiasm and the United States is what we place our confidence in.  And in the talks between us today that confidence became even stronger.  This is something that I wished to mention to you.  And the alliance between our two countries in order to strengthen this -- or if we strengthen this, this is not applying pressure to other countries or intimidating other countries.  This is for the peace and stability of the region and to strengthen this and to make this region a law-abiding region. Changes of the status quo based on intimidation and coercion will not be condoned.  We want to make this a peaceful region which values laws, and in doing this strengthening of our bilateral alliance is extremely important.  On this point, I fully trust President Obama.  The reporter has mentioned the situation in Ukraine.  In The Hague the G7 meeting took place, and President Obama exerted strong leadership and the G7 was united in its approach toward Russia.  Annexation of Crimea in violation of the international laws would not be condoned -- that was the message which was generated to Russia.  We would continue to communicate information -- message under the leadership of President Obama to Russia.  And with regard to the DPRK, unless they change the present policies there is no future for the public in the DPRK.  We need to make the DPRK understand this and pressure must be applied with cooperation between the international society to achieve this.  And China holds the key to this.  Japan, the United States, and ROK must exercise its influence over China. With regard to the Asia Pacific region as well as international society, there are various challenges and the alliance must continue to be robust so that we can cooperate to resolve issues in Asia and in the world. Question:  On the TPP, Id like to ask the question to the two leaders.  First to Prime Minister Abe, regarding TPP -- negotiations and consultations are to continue, you have said.  What are the remaining issues?  And to what extent have you made progress at the Diet?  With regard to the five sensitive items they resolve that in this stage the elimination of tariffs would not be accepted.  Do you believe under such circumstances an agreement can be reached?  The next question to President Obama.  Japan, with regard to rice and wheat and beef and pork, is very careful about reducing tariffs.  What is your view on this for agreement between Japan and the United States?  Agriculture, produce tariffs -- what is the ideal resolution to this issue in your view, please? Prime Minister Abe:  [As interpreted.]  On the TPP, this is to create a major economic zone in the growth area of Asia -- basic human rights, rule of law, and democracy with countries that share these values.  We will be creating new rules and it is for this purpose.  It is the 21st-century type of economic zone which we wish to create.  For the region as a whole, its strategically very important, and we see eye-to-eye on this point between President Obama and myself.  The remaining issues must be overcome very quickly and resolved so that TPP as a whole can be concluded.  We should cooperate and exert further leadership.  And that is the task that President Obama and I have, I believe.  And from a broad perspective, along with President Obama, we want to make decisions and judgments.  On the part of our country, there is this resolution adopted by the Diet.  We will take the proper heed of this so that we will choose the path in the best interest of the country.  But we also hope to conclude the talks in a favorable way.  We want to try to achieve conclusion of the talks as a whole. President Obama:  I will leave the details of the negotiations to the negotiators.  I think its fair to say that there are certain sectors of the Japanese economy -- agricultural sectors, the auto sector -- in which market access has been restricted historically, certainly compared to the market access that Japan has had to U.S. consumers.  And those are all issues that people are all familiar with, and at some point have to be resolved.  I believe that point is now.  Prime Minister Abe, I think courageously, has recognized that although Japan continues to be one of the most powerful economies in the world, that over the last two decades its pace of growth and innovation had stalled and that if, in fact, Japan wanted to push forward in this new century then reforms were going to have to take place.  And he has initiated a number of those reforms. TPP is consistent with those reforms.  And as Prime Minister Abe said, theres strategic importance to this because whats happening now is were shaping the economic environment for the fastest-growing region in the world, not just for this year or next year, but potentially for this decade and the next decade.  And what rules apply -- whether we are operating in a fair and transparent way, whether intellectual property is respected, whether markets are freely accessible, whether, in fact, countries are able to increase trade and as a consequence, increase jobs and prosperity for their people -- a lot of that is going to depend on choices and decisions that we make right now. TPP is an opportunity for us to make that happen. Now, there are always political sensitivities in any kind of trade discussions.  Prime Minister Abe has got to deal with his politics; Ive got to deal with mine.  And I think that Congress has passed, for example, recently a free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea and other countries around the world, and its been based on notions of reciprocity and notions that if we tear down some of these existing barriers that both countries can do better, both countries can grow.  This is even more challenging because we have more countries involved.  But my basis for doing this is because, ultimately, I think its good for America to have a Asia Pacific region where our companies can innovate, can compete, can sell our goods and services freely, where our intellectual property is protected. And I think thats going to create more jobs in the United States.  Its going to create greater prosperity in the United States.  But its a win-win situation, because I think the same is going to be true for Japan, the same is going to be true for Malaysia, the same is going to be true for Vietnam, the same is going to be true for the other countries that are in this discussion.  But that means that short term, all of us have to move out of our comfort zones and not just expect that were going to get access to somebody elses market without providing access to our own.  And it means that we have to sometimes push our constituencies beyond their current comfort levels because ultimately its going to deliver a greater good for all people. Mr. Carney:  Julie Pace of the Associated Press has the final question. Question:  I wanted to go back to the situation in Ukraine.  You said that Russia is so far not abiding by the Geneva agreement, but you appeared to indicate that you have not made a decision yet on levying further sanctions.  So, first, can you just clarify whether you have or have not made that decision?  And if you have not, what gives you confidence that holding off on further sanctions might change Russias calculus?  And couldnt they just be using the Geneva agreement as a stalling tactic as they weigh military options or try to influence the May Ukraine elections?  And, Prime Minister Abe, there are historical disputes in Asia that are a powerful source of tension and instability in this region.  What responsibility do you and other leaders in Asia have to avoid inflammatory language or actions, including further visits to the Yasukuni Shrine that could further exacerbate these tensions?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, Julie, we have been consistently preparing for the possibility that, in fact, Geneva didnt deliver on its promise.  I think youll remember I was asked the day that the discussions had concluded what my hopes were and I said, well, Im not overly optimistic about the ability to deliver.  And so what that means is that we have been preparing for the prospect that were going to have to engage in further sanctions.  Those are teed up.  It requires some technical work and it also requires coordination with other countries.  So the fact that I havent announced them yet doesnt mean that they havent been prepared and teed up.  At the point where they are ready to go, I guarantee you AP is going to be the first to know. Question:  Ill hold you to that. President Obama:  But I think its important to emphasize that throughout this process, our goal has been to change Mr. Putins calculus; that our preference is to resolve this issue diplomatically; that sanctions hurt Russia more than anybody else but theyre disruptive to the global economy and theyre unnecessary if, in fact, Russia would recognize that the government in Kyiv is prepared to have serious negotiations that preserve the rights of all Ukrainians, including Russian speakers, and is prepared to decentralize in ways that, originally, Mr. Putin said were of utmost importance to him.  So far, at least, they have not chosen the wise path.  And over the medium and long term, this is going to hurt Russia as much as it hurts Ukraine.  Already youve seen a whole lot of money, a whole lot of foreign investors leaving Russia because they dont see this as a reliable place to invest.  And Russia needs to reform its economy and needs to diversify its economy because the rest of the world is moving further and further off the fossil fuels that are the primary way that Russia is able to bankroll itself.  And the decisions right now that are being made in Ukraine will not help that process; it will hinder it.  Now, I understand that additional sanctions may not change Mr. Putins calculus -- thats possible.  How well they change his calculus in part depends on not just us applying sanctions but also the cooperation of other countries.  And thats why theres got to be a lot of diplomatic spadework done at each phase of this process.  And in discussions that Ive had with Prime Minister Abe, in discussions that I had with my European counterparts, my consistent point has been theres some things the United States can do alone, but ultimately its going to have to be a joint effort, a collective effort.  And so while weve done our homework and we have things teed up, its also important for us to make sure that were in consultation with all these countries each and every time that we apply additional sanctions. Question:  Can I clarify?  President Obama:  Sure. Question:  Are you saying that you have made a decision to apply further sanctions but you just have to wait for a technical process to play out?  Or are you saying you have not made the decision yet to levy those sanctions? President Obama:  What Im saying is, is that we have prepared for the possibility of applying additional sanctions, that there are a whole bunch of technical issues behind that;  that theres always the possibility that Russia, tomorrow or the next day, reverses course and takes a different approach -- which, by the way, would simply involve them stating clearly that they actually believe in what they said in Geneva, that they actually call on those who are holding buildings in the south and eastern Ukraine to get out of those buildings, that they are encouraged by the willingness of the Kyiv government to follow through on amnesty, that they allow OSCE monitors in and that they support an election process where Ukrainians are able to make their own decisions.  So it wouldnt require a radical shift.  It would require the kinds of steps that on paper, at least they already agreed to as recently as last week. Do I think theyre going to do that?", "filename": "24April2014JointPresserwithJapanPrimeMinisterShinzoAbe.txt"}, {"question": "They understood they were part of something larger; that they were contributing to a story of success that every American had a chance to share -- the basic American promise that if you worked hard, you could do well enough to raise a family, own a home, send your kids to college, and put a little away for retirement.  The defining issue of our time is how to keep that promise alive. No challenge is more urgent. No debate is more important. We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well while a growing number of Americans barely get by, or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, and everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules. Whats at stake arent Democratic values or Republican values, but American values. And we have to reclaim them. Lets remember how we got here. Long before the recession, jobs and manufacturing began leaving our shores. Technology made businesses more efficient, but also made some jobs obsolete. Folks at the top saw their incomes rise like never before, but most hardworking Americans struggled with costs that were growing, paychecks that werent, and personal debt that kept piling up. In 2008, the house of cards collapsed. We learned that mortgages had been sold to people who couldnt afford or understand them. Banks had made huge bets and bonuses with other peoples money. Regulators had looked the other way, or didnt have the authority to stop the bad behavior. It was wrong. It was irresponsible. And it plunged our economy into a crisis that put millions out of work, saddled us with more debt, and left innocent, hardworking Americans holding the bag. In the six months before I took office, we lost nearly 4 million jobs. And we lost another 4 million before our policies were in full effect. Those are the facts. But so are these: In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, weve agreed to cut the deficit by more than 2 trillion dollars. And weve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again. The state of our Union is getting stronger. And weve come too far to turn back now.  As long as Im President, I will work with anyone in this chamber to build on this momentum. But I intend to fight obstruction with action, and I will oppose any effort to return to the very same policies that brought on this economic crisis in the first place. No, we will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, bad debt, and phony financial profits. Tonight, I want to speak about how we move forward, and lay out a blueprint for an economy thats built to last -- an economy built on American manufacturing, American energy, skills for American workers, and a renewal of American values. Now, this blueprint begins with American manufacturing. On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Some even said we should let it die. With a million jobs at stake, I refused to let that happen.  In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We got workers and automakers to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Today, General Motors is back on top as the worlds number-one automaker. Chrysler has grown faster in the U.S. than any major car company. Ford is investing billions in U.S. plants and factories. And together, the entire industry added nearly 160,000 jobs.    We bet on American workers. We bet on American ingenuity. And tonight, the American auto industry is back. Whats happening in Detroit can happen in other industries. It can happen in Cleveland and Pittsburgh and Raleigh. We cant bring every job back thats left our shore. But right now, its getting more expensive to do business in places like China.  Meanwhile, America is more productive. A few weeks ago, the CEO of Master Lock told me that it now makes business sense for him to bring jobs back home. Today, for the first time in 15 years, Master Locks unionized plant in Milwaukee is running at full capacity. So we have a huge opportunity, at this moment, to bring manufacturing back. But we have to seize it. Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple: Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. We should start with our tax code. Right now, companies get tax breaks for moving jobs and profits overseas. Meanwhile, companies that choose to stay in America get hit with one of the highest tax rates in the world. It makes no sense, and everyone knows it. So lets change it.  First, if youre a business that wants to outsource jobs, you shouldnt get a tax deduction for doing it. That money should be used to cover moving expenses for companies like Master Lock that decide to bring jobs home. Second, no American company should be able to avoid paying its fair share of taxes by moving jobs and profits overseas. From now on, every multinational company should have to pay a basic minimum tax. And every penny should go towards lowering taxes for companies that choose to stay here and hire here in America. Third, if youre an American manufacturer, you should get a bigger tax cut. If youre a high-tech manufacturer, we should double the tax deduction you get for making your products here. And if you want to relocate in a community that was hit hard when a factory left town, you should get help financing a new plant, equipment, or training for new workers. So my message is simple. It is time to stop rewarding businesses that ship jobs overseas, and start rewarding companies that create jobs right here in America.  Send me these tax reforms, and I will sign them right away. Were also making it easier for American businesses to sell products all over the world. Two years ago, I set a goal of doubling U.S. exports over five years. With the bipartisan trade agreements we signed into law, were on track to meet that goal ahead of schedule. And soon, there will be millions of new customers for American goods in Panama, Colombia, and South Korea. Soon, there will be new cars on the streets of Seoul imported from Detroit, and Toledo, and Chicago.  I will go anywhere in the world to open new markets for American products. And I will not stand by when our competitors dont play by the rules. Weve brought trade cases against China at nearly twice the rate as the last Administration -- and its made a difference. Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires. But we need to do more. Its not right when another country lets our movies, music, and software be pirated. Its not fair when foreign manufacturers have a leg up on ours only because theyre heavily subsidized. Tonight, Im announcing the creation of a Trade Enforcement Unit that will be charged with investigating unfair trading practices in countries like China. There will be more inspections to prevent counterfeit or unsafe goods from crossing our borders. And this Congress should make sure that no foreign company has an advantage over American manufacturing when it comes to accessing financing or new markets like Russia. Our workers are the most productive on Earth, and if the playing field is level, I promise you -- America will always win. I also hear from many business leaders who want to hire in the United States but cant find workers with the right skills. Growing industries in science and technology have twice as many openings as we have workers who can do the job. Think about that -- openings at a time when millions of Americans are looking for work. Its inexcusable. And we know how to fix it.   Jackie Bray is a single mom from North Carolina who was laid off from her job as a mechanic. Then Siemens opened a gas turbine factory in Charlotte, and formed a partnership with Central Piedmont Community College. The company helped the college design courses in laser and robotics training. It paid Jackies tuition, then hired her to help operate their plant. I want every American looking for work to have the same opportunity as Jackie did.  Join me in a national commitment to train 2 million Americans with skills that will lead directly to a job. My Administration has already lined up more companies that want to help. Model partnerships between businesses like Siemens and community colleges in places like Charlotte, and Orlando, and Louisville are up and running.  Now you need to give more community colleges the resources they need to become community career centers -- places that teach people skills that businesses are looking for right now, from data management to high-tech manufacturing. And I want to cut through the maze of confusing training programs, so that from now on, people like Jackie have one program, one website, and one place to go for all the information and help that they need.  It is time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system that puts people to work. These reforms will help people get jobs that are open today. But to prepare for the jobs of tomorrow, our commitment to skills and education has to start earlier. For less than 1 percent of what our nation spends on education each year, weve convinced nearly every state in the country to raise their standards for teaching and learning -- the first time thats happened in a generation. But challenges remain. And we know how to solve them. At a time when other countries are doubling down on education, tight budgets have forced states to lay off thousands of teachers. We know a good teacher can increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over 250,000 dollars. A great teacher can offer an escape from poverty to the child who dreams beyond his circumstance. Every person in this chamber can point to a teacher who changed the trajectory of their lives. Most teachers work tirelessly, with modest pay, sometimes digging into their own pocket for school supplies -- just to make a difference. Teachers matter. So instead of bashing them, or defending the status quo, lets offer schools a deal. Give them the resources to keep good teachers on the job, and reward the best ones. And in return, grant schools flexibility: to teach with creativity and passion; to stop teaching to the test; and to replace teachers who just arent helping kids learn. Thats a bargain worth making. We also know that when students dont walk away from their education, more of them walk the stage to get their diploma. When students are not allowed to drop out, they do better. So tonight, I am proposing that every state -- every state -- requires that all students stay in high school until they graduate or turn 18. When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college. At a time when Americans owe more in tuition debt than credit card debt, this Congress needs to stop the interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Extend the tuition tax credit we started that saves millions of middle-class families thousands of dollars, and give more young people the chance to earn their way through college by doubling the number of work-study jobs in the next five years. Of course, its not enough for us to increase student aid. We cant just keep subsidizing skyrocketing tuition; well run out of money. States also need to do their part, by making higher education a higher priority in their budgets. And colleges and universities have to do their part by working to keep costs down. Recently, I spoke with a group of college presidents whove done just that. Some schools redesign courses to help students finish more quickly. Some use better technology. The point is, its possible. So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you cant stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down. Higher education cant be a luxury -- it is an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford. Lets also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they arent yet American citizens.  Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation. Others came more recently, to study business and science and engineering, but as soon as they get their degree, we send them home to invent new products and create new jobs somewhere else. That doesnt make sense. I believe as strongly as ever that we should take on illegal immigration. Thats why my Administration has put more boots on the border than ever before. Thats why there are fewer illegal crossings than when I took office. The opponents of action are out of excuses. We should be working on comprehensive immigration reform right now. But if election-year politics keeps Congress from acting on a comprehensive plan, lets at least agree to stop expelling responsible young people who want to staff our labs, start new businesses, defend this country. Send me a law that gives them the chance to earn their citizenship. I will sign it right away. You see, an economy built to last is one where we encourage the talent and ingenuity of every person in this country. That means women should earn equal pay for equal work. It means we should support everyone whos willing to work, and every risk-taker and entrepreneur who aspires to become the next Steve Jobs. After all, innovation is what America has always been about. Most new jobs are created in start-ups and small businesses. So lets pass an agenda that helps them succeed. Tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow. Expand tax relief to small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. Both parties agree on these ideas. So put them in a bill, and get it on my desk this year. Innovation also demands basic research.  Today, the discoveries taking place in our federally financed labs and universities could lead to new treatments that kill cancer cells but leave healthy ones untouched.  New lightweight vests for cops and soldiers that can stop any bullet.  Dont gut these investments in our budget.  Dont let other countries win the race for the future.  Support the same kind of research and innovation that led to the computer chip and the Internet; to new American jobs and new American industries. And nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy.  Over the last three years, weve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, Im directing my Administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now -- right now -- American oil production is the highest that its been in eight years.  Thats right -- eight years.  Not only that -- last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past 16 years. But with only 2 percent of the worlds oil reserves, oil isnt enough.  This country needs an all-out, all-of-the-above strategy that develops every available source of American energy. A strategy thats cleaner, cheaper, and full of new jobs. We have a supply of natural gas that can last America nearly 100 years. And my Administration will take every possible action to safely develop this energy.  Experts believe this will support more than 600,000 jobs by the end of the decade.  And Im requiring all companies that drill for gas on public lands to disclose the chemicals they use. Because America will develop this resource without putting the health and safety of our citizens at risk. The development of natural gas will create jobs and power trucks and factories that are cleaner and cheaper, proving that we dont have to choose between our environment and our economy. And by the way, it was public research dollars, over the course of 30 years, that helped develop the technologies to extract all this natural gas out of shale rock - reminding us that government support is critical in helping businesses get new energy ideas off the ground. Now, whats true for natural gas is just as true for clean energy.  In three years, our partnership with the private sector has already positioned America to be the worlds leading manufacturer of high-tech batteries.  Because of federal investments, renewable energy use has nearly doubled, and thousands of Americans have jobs because of it.  When Bryan Ritterby was laid off from his job making furniture, he said he worried that at 55, no one would give him a second chance.  But he found work at Energetx, a wind turbine manufacturer in Michigan.  Before the recession, the factory only made luxury yachts.  Today, its hiring workers like Bryan, who said, Im proud to be working in the industry of the future. Our experience with shale gas, our experience with natural gas, shows us that the payoffs on these public investments dont always come right away.  Some technologies dont pan out; some companies fail.  But I will not walk away from the promise of clean energy.  I will not walk away from workers like Bryan. I will not cede the wind or solar or battery industry to China or Germany because we refuse to make the same commitment here.  Weve subsidized oil companies for a century.  Thats long enough. Its time to end the taxpayer giveaways to an industry that rarely has been more profitable, and double-down on a clean energy industry that never has been more promising.  Pass clean energy tax credits.  Create these jobs. We can also spur energy innovation with new incentives.  The differences in this chamber may be too deep right now to pass a comprehensive plan to fight climate change.  But theres no reason why Congress shouldnt at least set a clean energy standard that creates a market for innovation.  So far, you havent acted.  Well, tonight, I will.  Im directing my Administration to allow the development of clean energy on enough public land to power 3 million homes.  And Im proud to announce that the Department of Defense, working with us, the worlds largest consumer of energy, will make one of the largest commitments to clean energy in history -- with the Navy purchasing enough capacity to power a quarter of a million homes a year. Of course, the easiest way to save money is to waste less energy.  So heres a proposal: Help manufacturers eliminate energy waste in their factories and give businesses incentives to upgrade their buildings.  Their energy bills will be 100 billion dollars lower over the next decade, and America will have less pollution, more manufacturing, more jobs for construction workers who need them.  Send me a bill that creates these jobs. Building this new energy future should be just one part of a broader agenda to repair Americas infrastructure.  So much of America needs to be rebuilt.  Weve got crumbling roads and bridges; a power grid that wastes too much energy; an incomplete high-speed broadband network that prevents a small business owner in rural America from selling her products all over the world.  During the Great Depression, America built the Hoover Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge.  After World War II, we connected our states with a system of highways.  Democratic and Republican Administrations invested in great projects that benefited everybody, from the workers who built them to the businesses that still use them today. In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects.  But you need to fund these projects.  Take the money were no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt, and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home. Theres never been a better time to build, especially since the construction industry was one of the hardest hit when the housing bubble burst.  Of course, construction workers werent the only ones who were hurt.  So were millions of innocent Americans whove seen their home values decline.  And while government cant fix the problem on its own, responsible homeowners shouldnt have to sit and wait for the housing market to hit bottom to get some relief.   And thats why Im sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about 3,000 dollars a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates. No more red tape.  No more runaround from the banks.  A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it wont add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust. Lets never forget: Millions of Americans who work hard and play by the rules every day deserve a government and a financial system that do the same. Its time to apply the same rules from top to bottom. No bailouts, no handouts, and no copouts. An America built to last insists on responsibility from everybody.  Weve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldnt afford them, and buyers who knew they couldnt afford them.  Thats why we need smart regulations to prevent irresponsible behavior. Rules to prevent financial fraud or toxic dumping or faulty medical devices -- these dont destroy the free market.  They make the free market work better. Theres no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary, or too costly.  In fact, Ive approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. Ive ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that dont make sense.  Weve already announced over 500 reforms, and just a fraction of them will save business and citizens more than 10 billion dollars over the next five years.  We got rid of one rule from 40 years ago that could have forced some dairy farmers to spend 10,000 dollars a year proving that they could contain a spill -- because milk was somehow classified as an oil.  With a rule like that, I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk. Now, Im confident a farmer can contain a milk spill without a federal agency looking over his shoulder. Absolutely.  But I will not back down from making sure an oil company can contain the kind of oil spill we saw in the Gulf two years ago.  I will not back down from protecting our kids from mercury poisoning, or making sure that our food is safe and our water is clean.  I will not go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, deny your coverage, or charge women differently than men. And I will not go back to the days when Wall Street was allowed to play by its own set of rules.  The new rules we passed restore what should be any financial systems core purpose:  Getting funding to entrepreneurs with the best ideas, and getting loans to responsible families who want to buy a home, or start a business, or send their kids to college. So if you are a big bank or financial institution, youre no longer allowed to make risky bets with your customers deposits.  Youre required to write out a living will that details exactly how youll pay the bills if you fail -- because the rest of us are not bailing you out ever again.  And if youre a mortgage lender or a payday lender or a credit card company, the days of signing people up for products they cant afford with confusing forms and deceptive practices -- those days are over.  Today, American consumers finally have a watchdog in Richard Cordray with one job: to look out for them. Well also establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect peoples investments.  Some financial firms violate major anti-fraud laws because theres no real penalty for being a repeat offender.  Thats bad for consumers, and its bad for the vast majority of bankers and financial service professionals who do the right thing.  So pass legislation that makes the penalties for fraud count.  And tonight, Im asking my Attorney General to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorney general to expand our investigations into the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis.  This new unit will hold accountable those who broke the law, speed assistance to homeowners, and help turn the page on an era of recklessness that hurt so many Americans.  Now, a return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy.  But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future. Right now, our most immediate priority is stopping a tax hike on 160 million working Americans while the recovery is still fragile. People cannot afford losing 40 dollars out of each paycheck this year.  There are plenty of ways to get this done.  So lets agree right here, right now:  No side issues.  No drama.  Pass the payroll tax cut without delay.  Lets get it done. When it comes to the deficit, weve already agreed to more than 2 trillion dollars in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices.  Right now, were poised to spend nearly 1 trillion dollars more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans.  Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households.  Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.   Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?  Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else -- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans?  Because if were serious about paying down our debt, we cant do both.   The American people know what the right choice is.  So do I.  As I told the Speaker this summer, Im prepared to make more reforms that rein in the long-term costs of Medicare and Medicaid, and strengthen Social Security, so long as those programs remain a guarantee of security for seniors.  But in return, we need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes. Tax reform should follow the Buffett Rule. If you make more than 1 million dollars a year, you should not pay less than 30 percent in taxes. And my Republican friend Tom Coburn is right: Washington should stop subsidizing millionaires. In fact, if youre earning a million dollars a year, you shouldnt get special tax subsidies or deductions. On the other hand, if you make under 250,000 dollars a year, like 98 percent of American families, your taxes shouldnt go up. Youre the ones struggling with rising costs and stagnant wages. Youre the ones who need relief.    Now, you can call this class warfare all you want. But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.  We dont begrudge financial success in this country.  We admire it.  When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, its not because they envy the rich.  Its because they understand that when I get a tax break I dont need and the country cant afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference -- like a senior on a fixed income, or a student trying to get through school, or a family trying to make ends meet.  Thats not right.  Americans know thats not right.  They know that this generations success is only possible because past generations felt a responsibility to each other, and to the future of their country, and they know our way of life will only endure if we feel that same sense of shared responsibility.  Thats how well reduce our deficit.  Thats an America built to last. Now, I recognize that people watching tonight have differing views about taxes and debt, energy and health care.  But no matter what party they belong to, I bet most Americans are thinking the same thing right about now:  Nothing will get done in Washington this year, or next year, or maybe even the year after that, because Washington is broken. Can you blame them for feeling a little cynical?  The greatest blow to our confidence in our economy last year didnt come from events beyond our control.  It came from a debate in Washington over whether the United States would pay its bills or not.  Who benefited from that fiasco?", "filename": "24January2012ThirdPresidentialStateoftheUnionSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Let me thank Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Steinmeier for welcoming me earlier today. Thank you Mayor Wowereit, the Berlin Senate, the police, and most of all thanks to all of you for this extraordinary welcome. Thank you. I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before; although tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for President, but as a citizen -- a proud citizen of the United States, and a fellow citizen of the world. I know that I dont look like the Americans whove previously spoken in this great city. The journey that led me here is improbable. My mother was born in the heartland of America, but my father grew up herding goats in Kenya. His father -- His father -- my grandfather -- was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. At the height of the Cold War, my father decided, like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world, that his yearning -- his dream -- required the freedom and opportunity promised by the West. And so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across America until somebody, somewhere answered his prayer for a better life. That is why I am here. And you are here because you too know that yearning. This city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom. And you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life. Ours is a partnership that truly began 60 years ago this summer, on the day when the first American plane touched down at Tempelhof. On that day -- On that day much of this continent still lay in ruin.  The rubble of this city had yet to be built into a wall. The Soviet shadow had swept across Eastern Europe, while in the West, America, Britain, and France took their stock of their losses, and pondered how the world might be remade. This is where the two sides met. And on the twenty-fourth of June, 1948, the Communists chose to blockade the western part of the city. They cut off food and supplies to more than two million Germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in Berlin. The size of our forces was no match for the larger Soviet Army. And yet retreat would have allowed Communism to march across Europe. Where the last war had ended, another World War could have easily begun. And all that stood in the way was Berlin. And thats when -- that's when the airlift began, when the largest and most unlikely rescue in the history brought food and hope to the people of this city. The odds were stacked against success. In the winter, a heavy fog filled the sky above, and many planes were forced to turn back without dropping off the needed supplies. The streets where we stand were filled with hungry families who had no comfort from the cold. But in the darkest hours, the people of Berlin kept the flame of hope burning. The people of Berlin refused to give up. And on one fall day, hundreds of thousands of Berliners came here, to the Tiergarten, and heard the citys mayor implore the world not to give up on freedom. There is only one possibility, he said. For us to stand together united until this battle is wonThe people of Berlin have spoken. We have done our duty,\" he said, \"and we will keep on doing our duty. People of the world, now do your duty. People of the world, look at Berlin. People of the world -- look at Berlin! Look at Berlin, where Germans and Americans learned to work together and trust each other less than three years after facing each other on the field of battle. Look at Berlin, where the determination of a people met the generosity of the Marshall Plan and created a German miracle; where a -- where a victory over tyranny gave rise to NATO, the greatest alliance ever formed to defend our common security. Look at Berlin, where the bullet holes in the buildings and the somber stones and pillars near the Brandenburg Gate insist that we never forget our common humanity. People of the world -- look at Berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one. Sixty years after the airlift, we are called upon again. History has led us to a new crossroad, with new promise and new peril. When you, the German people, tore down that wall -- a wall that divided East and West; freedom and tyranny; fear and hope -- walls came tumbling down around the world. From Kiev to Cape Town, prison camps were closed, and the doors of democracy were opened. Markets opened too, and the spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity. While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st century has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history. The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope. But that very closeness has given rise to new dangers -- dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean. Think about it: The terrorists of September 11th plotted in Hamburg and trained in Kandahar and Karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on American soil. As we speak, cars in Boston and factories in Beijing are melting the ice caps in the Arctic, shrinking coastlines in the Atlantic, and bringing drought to farms from Kansas to Kenya. Poorly secured nuclear material in the former Soviet Union, or secrets from a scientist in Pakistan could help build a bomb that detonates in Paris. The poppies in Afghanistan come to Berlin in the form of the heroin. The poverty and violence in Somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow. The genocide in Darfur shames the conscience of us all. In this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them. And that is why we cannot afford to be divided. No one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone. None of us can deny these threats, or escape responsi[bility] in meeting them. In the absence of Soviet tanks and a terrible wall, it has become easy to forget this truth. And if were honest with each other, we know that sometimes, on both sides of the Atlantic, we have drifted apart, and forgotten our shared destiny. In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help us make it right, has become all too common. In America, there are voices that deride and deny the importance of Europes role in our security and our future. Both views miss the truth: that Europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world; and that just as American bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent, so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe. Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe. No doubt, there will be differences in the future. But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together. A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden. In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more -- not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the only way, the one way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity. That is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another. The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand. The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand. The walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; Christians and Muslims and Jews cannot stand. These now are the walls we must tear down. We know -- We know that these walls have fallen before. After centuries of strife, the people of Europe have formed a Union of promise and prosperity. Here, at the base of a column built to mark victory in war, we meet in the center of a Europe at peace. Not only have walls come down in Berlin, but they've come down in Belfast, where Protestant and Catholic found a way to live together; in the Balkans, where our Atlantic alliance ended wars and brought savage war criminals to justice; and in South Africa, where the struggle of a courageous people defeated apartheid. So history reminds us that walls can be torn down. But the task is never easy. True partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice. They require sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy; of peace and progress. They require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each other and, most of all, trust each other. That is why America cannot turn inward. That is why Europe cannot turn inward. America has no better partner than Europe. Now -- Now is the time to build new bridges across the globe as strong as the one that binds us across the Atlantic. Now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation and strong institutions and shared sacrifice and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads, and people to assemble where we stand today. And this is the moment when our nations -- and all nations -- must summon that spirit anew. This is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it. This threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it. If we could create NATO to face down the Soviet Union, we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in Madrid and Amman; in London and Bali; in Washington and New York. If we could win a battle of ideas against the communists, we can stand with the vast majority of Muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope. This is the moment when we must renew our resolve to rout the terrorists who threaten our security in Afghanistan, and the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets. No one welcomes war. I recognize the enormous difficulties in Afghanistan. But my country and yours have a stake in seeing that NATOs first mission beyond Europes borders is a success. For the people of Afghanistan, and for our shared security, the work must be done. America can't do this alone.  The Afghan people need our troops and your troops; our support and your support to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda, to develop their economy, and to help them rebuild their nation. We have too much at stake to turn back now. This -- This is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  The two superpowers that faced each other across the wall of this city came too close too often to destroying all we have built and all that we love. With that wall gone, we need not stand idly by and watch the further spread of the deadly atom. It is time to secure all loose nuclear materials; to stop the spread of nuclear weapons; and to reduce the arsenals from another era. This is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons. This is the moment when every nation in Europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow, free from the shadows of yesterday. In this century, we need a strong European Union that deepens the security and prosperity of this continent, while extending a hand abroad. In this century -- in this city of all cities -- we must reject the Cold War mind-set of the past, and resolve to work with Russia when we can, to stand up for our values when we must, and to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent. This is the moment when we must build on the wealth that opens [sic] markets have created, and share its benefits more equitably. Trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development. But we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few, and not the many. Together -- Together we must forge trade that truly rewards the work that creates wealth, with meaningful protections for our people and our planet. This is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all. This is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East. My country must stand with yours and with Europe in sending a direct message to Iran that it must abandon its nuclear ambitions. We must support the Lebanese who've marched and bled for democracy, and the Israelis and the Palestinians who seek a secure and lasting peace. And despite -- despite past differences, this is the moment when the world should support the millions of Iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives, even as we pass responsibility to the Iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close. This -- This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet. Let us resolve that we will not leave our children to a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands. Let us resolve that all nations -- including my own -- will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere. This -- This is the moment to give our children back their future. This is the moment to stand as one. And this is the moment when we must give hope to those left behind in a globalized world. We must remember that the Cold War born in this city was not a battle for land or treasure. Sixty years ago, the planes that flew over Berlin did not drop bombs; instead they delivered food, and coal, and candy to grateful children. And in that show of solidarity, those pilots won more than a military victory. They won hearts and minds; love and loyalty and trust -- not just from the people in this city, but from all those who heard the story of what they did here. Now the world will watch and remember what we do here -- what we do with this moment. Will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of this world who yearn for lives marked by dignity and opportunity, by security and justice? Will we lift the child in Bangladesh from poverty, and shelter the refugee in Chad, and banish the scourge of AIDS in our time? Will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in Burma, the blogger in Iran, or the voter in Zimbabwe? Will we give meaning to the words never again in Darfur? Will we acknowledge -- Will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world? Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law? Will we -- Will we -- Will we welcome immigrants from different lands, and shun discrimination against those who dont look like us or worship like we do, and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people?", "filename": "24July2008SpeechtothePeopleofBerlin.txt"}, {"question": "We sell more products made in America to the rest of the world than ever before.  We produce more natural gas than any country on Earth.  Were about to produce more of our own oil than we buy from abroad for the first time in nearly 20 years.  The cost of health care is growing at its slowest rate in 50 years.  And our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years. So thanks to the grit and resilience and determination of the American people -- of folks like you -- weve been able to clear away the rubble from the financial crisis.  We started to lay a new foundation for stronger, more durable economic growth. And it's happening in our own personal lives as well, right?", "filename": "24July2013KnoxCollegeSpeechontheEconomy.txt"}, {"question": "Even if you think Ive done everything wrong, the trends I just talked about were happening well before I took office.  So its not enough for you just to oppose me.  You got to be for something.  What are your ideas?", "filename": "24July2013KnoxCollegeSpeechontheEconomy.txt"}, {"question": "Because Ill tell you, Galesburg, thats where I believe America needs to go.  I believe thats where the American people want to go.  And it may seem hard today, but if were willing to take a few bold steps -- if Washington will just shake off its complacency and set aside the kind of slash-and-burn partisanship that weve just seen for way too long -- if we just make some common-sense decisions, our economy will be stronger a year from now.  It will be stronger five years from now.  It will be stronger 10 years from now. If we focus on what matters, then more Americans will know the pride of that first paycheck.  More Americans will have the satisfaction of flipping the sign to Open on their own business.  More Americans will have the joy of scratching the height of their kid on that door of their brand-new home. And in the end, isn't that what makes us special?  It's not the ability to generate incredible wealth for the few; it's our ability to give everybody a chance to pursue their own true measure of happiness.  We havent just wanted success for ourselves -- we want it for our neighbors, too. When we think about our own communities -- we're not a mean people; we're not a selfish people; we're not a people that just looks out for number one.  Why should our politics reflect those kinds of values?", "filename": "24July2013KnoxCollegeSpeechontheEconomy.txt"}, {"question": "And I think going from a 100-year-old sacred temple to this 21st century Dreamplex is I think a wonderful expression of the evolution that's taken place here in Vietnam -- a country that honors its history, but is also boldly racing towards the future.  And thats also the story of this city.  This is a city on the move.  And we could see as we were traveling in from the airport all the activity that's currently taking place.  And Im not just talking about the traffic -- although I do think it might be easier to be on a motorbike than a motorcade.  But this city, like this country, is full of energy.  You can see it in the skyscrapers shooting above the horizon and the shops that are springing up at every corner.  You can spot it online, where tens of millions of Vietnamese are connecting with each other and with the world.  And you can feel it here at Dreamplex, where ideas are becoming a reality.  I just had the chance to see some of those ideas in action -- young people who are making things happen.  I saw a virtual game that can help people recover from nerve injuries, to a machine that lets your smartphone control a laser-cutter -- although you have to be careful with the laser-cutter where you point it.     But some of this energy may be due to your famous c ph trng.  That stuff is strong, I understand.  But the real driver of Vietnams growth, and the engine of Ho Chi Minh City, is the spirit of entrepreneurship -- the spirit that brings us here today.  And I see it everywhere I travel all around the world.  I meet people -- and especially young people, like the three that we're about to meet -- who are eager to strike out on their own, start something new, and shape their own destinies.  Many want to do more than just create a great new appropriate for a phone.  They want to contribute to their communities and help people live better lives.  And thats what entrepreneurship is all about.  It's building businesses -- making a profit, hopefully.  But it's also about creating good jobs, and developing new products, and devising ways to serve others.  Entrepreneurship is also the fuel for prosperity that puts rising economies on the path to success. Its what gives young people like so many of you the chance to channel your energy and your passion into something that is bigger than yourselves.  And it allows us to come together across countries and cultures to solve some of the worlds greatest challenges.  Of course, being an entrepreneur is not easy.  Its not easy in the United States; it's not easy here in Vietnam; it's not easy anyplace in the world.  It can be tough to get started.  Its hard to access capital.  It's hard to get the skills that you need to run a business.  You might not always have the mentors and the networks that can help guide you along the way.  And it can be especially difficult for women, for others who traditionally are not viewed as being at the center of business life in a country, haven't had all the access to the same opportunities.  So weve got to tap all the talent that's out there.  Just because you are born poor does not mean you should not be able to start a business.  Just because you don't look like the traditional businessman doesnt mean you can't make a great product or deliver a great service.  And thats why Dreamplex is so important.  Its not only a home for digital entrepreneurs like you.  Its also a place where you can share ideas and work together and build a community that supports each other.  And incubators like this allow Vietnam, alongside its emphasis on entrepreneurship, to see more startups happening in this country than ever before.  Recently, in one year alone, the funding for startups doubled in this country.  And were seeing major acquisitions, like Fossil Groups takeover Misfit Wearables, a Vietnamese company that makes devices like fitness trackers.  Were seeing Vietnamese-Americans who are coming here to start new ventures -- and that shows a strong bond between the United States and Vietnam. And the world is taking notice.  A leading global venture capital firm called 500 Startups just launched a 10 million dollar fund here in Ho Chi Minh City.  Next month at our Global Entrepreneurship Summit -- something that I've been hosting now for several years -- Ill welcome eight Vietnamese entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley, so that they can learn from some of the best entrepreneurs and startups and venture capitalists in the world. And your success sends a message to global investors about this countrys incredible potential for innovation.  Hopefully it also encourages other Vietnamese entrepreneurs to chase that new great idea and start that new company, which will continue to fuel an ever-expanding Vietnam economy. Im here today because the United States is committed to being a partner as you grow.  With the Peace Corps coming to Vietnam for the first time, our volunteers are going to help more Vietnamese learn English -- the language that so often is used in the global economy.  With programs like our Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative, were helping give thousands of young people across Vietnam the skills and networks they need to turn their ideas into action.  With our U.S.-ASEAN Connect Initiative, were matching American investors with Vietnamese entrepreneurs in areas like clean energy.  With the womens entrepreneurship center were going to open here in Vietnam -- WECREATE is what we're going to call it -- well help empower the next generation of women business owners.  And if we really want to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, I should mention that we need to move ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because TPP will not only let us sell more of our goods to each other and bring our economies closer together, it will accelerate economic reforms here in Vietnam, boost your economic competitiveness, open up new markets not only for large companies but also for small and medium-sized businesses.  It will raise labor and environmental standards, and it will improve business conditions so that entrepreneurs like you can thrive.  So my message to all the entrepreneurs here today is that I believe in you, America believes in you, and were going to keep investing in your success.  Ultimately, its the inventors and dreamers, people like those that I just met, those that we'll hear from soon, and all of you in the audience who are going to shape Vietnams future for decades to come.  So I'm looking forward to hearing from these outstanding young leaders.  Thank you very much.  Cam on.  So I'm just going to introduce very quickly these outstanding young businesspeople who are leading the way here in Vietnam.  We invited them here to give us some of their thoughts about what would make it easier for them to start their businesses and to continue to nurture the startups that theyre involved with.  The first is Khoa Pham, who is the director of Legal and Corporate at Microsoft Vietnam.  We have Le Hoang Uyen Vy, who is the founder of Adayroi, which is aiming to become the Amazon of Vietnam.  And we have Do Thi Thuy Hang, whos the vice president of Seedcom, which invests in Vietnamese companies.  So please give them a big round of applause, and we'll start our conversation.  So, Vy, let's start with you.  And tell us -- it sounds like you started being interested in business at a very young age. Vy:  Good evening, Mr. President.  And good evening, everyone.  First of all, I'd like to say thank you to the Vietnamese and U.S. governments for organizing such a wonderful event.  My name is Vy, and I graduated from Georgetown University in 2009, majoring in finance.  Actually, I have a passion for technology when I was in school.  When I was 13, I decided to start my own web design company.  And I love the idea of connecting buyers and sellers to an online platform, just like eBay or Amazon. But at the moment, I was so young and I couldn't start a formal business.  And therefore, after my college graduation, I decided to come back to Vietnam and started -- an e-marketplace selling fashion items.  And luckily, after five years, we became one of the top destination for fashion lovers in Vietnam.  And we got acquired by the biggest conglomerate in Vietnam.  And right now I'm running Adayroi.com.  Basically, we're the Amazon[.com] of Vietnam.  We sell everything from electronics to even groceries online.  And our goal is to bring safe and high-quality products at affordable price to every family in Vietnam. President Obama:  That's great.  Now, you look very good.  Is this some of your fashion that you can sell online?    Is that like you can buy the necklace and the earrings? VY:  They are available on Adayroi.com.    President Obama:  So if you're looking for a good deal --   Excellent.  And, Hang, you started out as an entrepreneur.  Now you're an investor as well.  Tell us what have been the challenges that youve met.  And there have been some special challenges about being a woman entrepreneur and investor here in Vietnam.  Hang:  Mr. President, I am glad to be here as well.  I guess lets take it back a little bit.  I came back to Vietnam five years ago after nine years in the States.  So America is truly my second home.  And when I came back it was basically because of my very close ties with Vietnam.  My family has been here; my hometown is here; a lot of people here.  Because the environment has been very supporting, I've learned a lot from previous generations.  And certainly because I have seen successful role models here, that's why I came back. I never thought that being a female entrepreneur would be a disadvantage here in the local market because, from my experience and observations about the area, I'm very proud to say that in Vietnam women are treated equally and given a lot of opportunity. So whether we try or not is all stuff within ourselves.  And we see a lot of women entrepreneurs in the room as well.  Le Hoang Uyen Vy, who you just mentioned, shes incredible.  Shes not an entrepreneur, per se, but she has done a terrific job here in Ho Chi Minh City.  We all love her. So if the world was run by women -- and I'm thinking the United States election this year -- it would be a better place.  Like you always say.  You always say that. President Obama:  I do.  So what kind of businesses are you looking to invest in at this point? Hang:  Vietnam is among the top exporters of agricultural products in the world.  Yet there are a lot of untapped opportunities in agriculture.  And it is a very low-tech, low-productivity sector.  And at Seedcom, we've worked with a lot of companies across retail, technology and logistics.  But the project that we're most excited about at the moment is in agriculture.  We apply technology to traditional farming -- stuff like tracking automation.  Basically we bring the product all the way to end user at a higher value. So that is I guess the next wave in innovation in Vietnam, where entrepreneurs and investors come together, using technology to tackle very traditional industries.  President Obama:  So, Pham, you were born here, moved to the States when you were 11.  Is that right? Pham:  That's right.  President Obama:  And got your education there, worked in Washington, ended up at a very impressive startup called Microsoft.    And so now you're here representing Microsoft in Ho Chi Minh City.  Tell us about, what are the opportunities that Microsoft is seeing?  And how you think U.S. companies can most effectively interact with Vietnamese businesspeople and startups and entrepreneurs. Pham:  Well, welcome to Vietnam, Mr. President.  I know it's early morning in Washington, D.C. -- President Obama:  I've gotten over the jetlag. I'm fine. Pham:  -- so I'm glad you're awake.   So I returned to Vietnam for the same reason that my parents had when they took me out of Vietnam as a young boy, and that is that they wanted me to have an opportunity for a better life.  And we found that in the U.S.  And after 35 years living in the U.S., I decided to return to Vietnam to give the same opportunities and to make a difference to the young people of Vietnam -- maybe some sitting here today.  And so the way I look at my return is that Microsoft gives me the opportunity to make a difference, to improve lives for people, to produce the technology, as well as to accelerate the development of the country through technology by the improvement of our IT infrastructure.  So I see a lot of investors, young entrepreneurs, and the spirit of entrepreneurship here in Vietnam.  And that is the reason I returned to Vietnam. President Obama:  So, Vy, you were mentioning how you want to be the Amazon of Vietnam.  Tell me about the challenges you have in trying to build a digital platform for commerce here in Vietnam, and what makes it different trying to develop that here than it might be in the United States, where, obviously, theres more digital platforms and penetration.  I'm assuming that, particularly if you want to reach rural areas, that some of the logistical challenges are different.  So tell us what has been some of the hardest aspects of building on your vision, and how do you think both the Vietnamese government, or the United States government, or companies that are interested in working with you or other entrepreneurs -- how they can be most helpful.  Where do you see the biggest roadblocks? Vy:  -- about bringing convenience and more lifestyle to the Vietnamese people.  Imagine that working moms have a job from 9:00 to 6:00, and then after 6:00 p.m., she has to rush to the supermarket to shop for her dinner, it would probably take her an hour to get home, and then ready to cook for the family. President Obama:  Because the traffic is -- Vy:  Right, the traffic jam.    So imagine that one day she can sit in her office and order all the ingredients, and when she gets home the meal will be ready for her to cook dinner for her family.  So every day we can save her an hour to spend more time with her family.  Imagine that we can save her 360 hours per year, which translates to 7,300 hours over 20 years, which is equivalent to almost a year.  So we can save a woman a year over 20 years.  So that's now our dream.  But basically, it's very challenging because even online grocery is difficult because of the infrastructure.  It's very difficult for us to get the items to the customer on time, and especially when you have a commitment to deliver it within two hours, which is quite impossible when we first started.  But then we are very committed.  So we do our own delivery structure, we do our own delivery.  And up to now I think we have a feeling of it so we are able to deliver our product as fast as we can to satisfy the customers. So a couple challenges that I think either the government in Vietnam or the U.S. government can help us is, first, to help us to develop our infrastructure -- the logistics, the payment structure, and bring technology to Vietnam.  So that's always been my dream. President Obama:  So one of the challenges is just making sure that you have the physical infrastructure so that you can deliver fast enough.  But in terms of the digital infrastructure, is that well developed, because everybody has a smartphone now? Vy:  It's much, much better now because people are getting used to using their smartphone to order things online.  Three years ago, when I first started, it was so difficult to get people online.  But now it's very easy.  But still -- so the operational infrastructure is not there yet, so we need to learn it from successful companies like Amazon, or we need to come up with our own solution in Vietnam.  Because the industry in Vietnam is not the same as the U.S.  You understand, right?  So we have all the deliverymen on motorbike.  And they have to know their way around.  It's very difficult to install GPS. President Obama:  And just one last question.  In terms of access to capital, typically, are startups here self-financed, or are they financed through the banks?  Is there enough of sort of a bank infrastructure for small businesses and medium-sized businesses?  Or are you using -- are most entrepreneurs using family savings?  Is there venture capital?  How are people getting started? Vy:  That's a very good question.  To be honest, I think in Vietnam, it's very difficult to get early funding.  Especially theres not that many venture capital funding here in Vietnam.  For seed funding and investors, very limited.  I think most of the investors in Vietnam, they want to invest in companies that have track records, which is quite a challenge for a startup in Vietnam.  So we have family startup here.  It's good news for us. And we hope that in the near future, more venture funds can come to Vietnam, especially from America, to help us grow all of the new businesses. President Obama:  Well, I'm trying to do some advertising for you here.  Hopefully somebody is paying attention back in the United States.  So, Hang, you were talking about agriculture.  Obviously a large portion of Vietnam is still dependent on basic agricultural and small farmers.  Is the goal here for them to be able to move their products to market at a better price and more quickly?  Or is it that you want to move up the value chain so that theres more processing that's taking place, so it's not just rice or other crops, but it's also the products that are derived from the foodstuffs that are being grown?  Or is it all of the above?  Tell me a little bit more about how you see the opportunity for agriculture to accelerate here in Vietnam. Hang:  I guess all of the above.  Of course, myself, we cannot change the [inaudible], but many investors and entrepreneurs working together, we can make an impact.  So as I mentioned, there are two partners in our business.  One is to apply more technology.  Some technology is just very, very simple.  You can text message.  You can [inaudible] on the farm, et cetera.  That improves the productivity massively, and that helps the farmers to increase their output and, as a result, their income.                          And secondly, basically, have a trust and more value and bring the products to the end users at a higher price.  And obviously the result of that is also higher income.  And we understand that there are a lot of challenges like you mentioned. Logistically, it's not there yet.  The infrastructure, there is a lot to do.  But we are a very young team and they are farmers and they have a lot of -- I know personally a lot of people, young people who work in agriculture.  And we have so much passion and energy and drive, and beyond that, we even have a strategy and action plan to make this happen.  So hopefully, in the next few years you see some very positive change in agriculture in Vietnam. President Obama:  So, Pham, when you think about business here versus business as you're accustomed to seeing in the United States, what are some of the big differences?  And are there particular areas where you think a strategic investment would make a big difference in helping all these startups take off?  And in terms of Microsofts strategy, are your main clients large businesses, and just helping them with respect to IT, or are you also working with some of these smaller startups to see how you can grow their businesses and hopefully help them really take off? Pham:  I'm sure you have heard from -- our CO.  Our company mission is to empower every person, every organization on the planet to achieve more.  And I think there is no better market to do that than in Vietnam, because of the young entrepreneurs that we have here and the penetration, the mobile base that we have here with young people.  And I think that in terms of capturing the opportunity, I think that's important for us to look at -- for our government -- and businesses and entrepreneurs to really balance the opportunity and the responsibility in this new world that we live in, which is a mobile world. And so if we look at the challenges in that respect, I think public policy, regulatory environment -- it needs to be more conducive, it needs to be modernized to address the digital economy.  And I think that Vietnam is not unique in that space of the developing market.  I think in the U.S. that the same things have been faced with how do we deal with e-commerce across borders, taxation issues and things of that nature.  But I think that Vietnam can [inaudible] other markets, and seeing and capturing that opportunity. For Microsoft Vietnam, in particular, we have a national empowerment plan that basically mirrors the government ICT master plan by 2020 to really develop Vietnam in ICT advanced nation.  And so, in that regard, we look at the three key pillars, which is the ICT infrastructure of a country, helping really secure the cybersecurity apparatus of the country, really looking at the issue of privacy with the protection of the ICT infrastructure for a national cloud -- to really take advantage of that.  And also our investment, in the second pillar, which is about small and medium-sized enterprises -- I think that is going to be the driving factor for the economic growth in this country. We have about 500,000 businesses here of that size, and so I would say that the startup community is also the micro businesses that are starting out.  And we have programs that provide free software, free cloud services to these startups.  So this way, they can really focus on developing the best products.  And then, honestly, the education side, we really have to look at capacity building, and that is to really help the Vietnamese move from a labor-intensive economy into more of a knowledge economy, knowledge-based economy.  And that is really getting them the right skill set for ICT skill set and also we need to really invest a bit more on STEM education.  And we're doing that -- and teaching the technology in the classrooms, and really doing a lot of these startup community, co-working space, community events to really promote coding, because I think that's very important.  And I think [inaudible] -- I think that's something we do here annually as well. President Obama:  I think that's a great point, and, Vy and Hang, maybe you want to talk about this a little bit.  Ultimately, what makes startups and entrepreneurs successful is good ideas and the human capital.  Obviously investors are important and infrastructure is important, but the most important thing is people.  And when you look at Vietnam right now, it seems as if a culture of entrepreneurship is really beginning to grow.  But one of the questions that I always have to ask myself in the United States is whether our education system is equipping our children effectively enough to be able to move forward on their ideas. So you're both very young, so you can still remember what it's like to go to school.  For me, I've forgotten. But I will say that when I was going to school we didnt have computers.  Well, you had these big mainframe computers, but you didnt have personal computers.    How do you see the education system here adapting to the needs of this new 21st century economy? Vy:  I still remember taking entrepreneurship classes in the U.S. and I found it so helpful for me to learn about how to write a business plan, how to pitch to an investor -- and I think when I got back here, I don't find many entrepreneurship classes in Vietnam.  So I think that's an empty area that we can tap on.  And secondly, I think after the startup gets funding, I think they also need mentorship program.  Those are the things that really helps the startup community in Vietnam.  And I also think that -- I used to be an exchange student.  I came to U.S. when I was 17.  I'm very thankful for that because I learned so much about innovation and I learned how to dream big and always hope for a brighter future.  So I think theres a chance for us to also create exchange programs, not just for students but for working adults.  Especially we can send young startups to do on-the-job training or internship program at some U.S. company.  So those are the things that I really want to get to the audience. President Obama:  Good.  Hang? Hang:  I'd like to add to what Vy just said -- the power of technology.  Again, I go back to this.  Students now, they have access to a lot more information, and education opens new sector for startups to come and basically [inaudible.]  So a friend, he has a education startup.  Another friend who I know very well, she launched a startup that helps students learn English through an app.  So all of those examples you can see that technology basically opens the door and opens opportunities for Vietnamese students to access global knowledge. And the evidence of that is most of the teams that I work with in Vietnam for my previous startup -- they all are educated in Vietnam.  I'm one of the very lucky few that got years of education in the States.  But I respect my colleagues a lot every day -- theyre so smart.  They learn in Vietnam.  They learn not only by going to school, but also by doing, by talking to older people, and obviously learning from the Internet.  So I do think technology is changing education. President Obama:  Well, Pham was talking about leapfrogging. One of the things that you're seeing in countries all around the world is if they haven't already developed a telephone infrastructure with landlines and telephone poles and underground tunnels, now, suddenly, they just go straight to cellular towers and smartphones.  And banking is done there, and commerce is done through phones.  And so theyve leapfrogged over the infrastructure requirements of both systems.  And the same is true with education.  If done properly, the opportunity for online education that is much cheaper but is still of high quality that can accelerate the ability of a child here in Vietnam to learn coding, learn business practices and so forth, without an expensive education or having to study overseas is hugely important.  And with our contribution through the Peace Corps, through entrepreneurship summits, through the sponsorships that we're getting various companies to engage in, our hope is, is that we'll be able to provide the kind of training to young people that will be incredibly powerful for them in the future.  And we want to thank the Vietnamese government for their cooperation, because a lot of these systems that we're trying to build we could not do if it were not for the strong support that we're receiving from them.  But any other closing thoughts that you think either the President of the United States or the President of Vietnam or any of these business leaders here should hear about? Question:  Mr. President, let me ask you a question.    President Obama:  Oh, sure.  The tide is turned.    Question:  So when you were a kid, did you dream of becoming President one day? President Obama:  No.  I think there are some people who they had a very clear vision for themselves.  I really didnt -- I was not as well organized as all of you when I was young.  I think it wasnt until I was in college that I began to develop a sense of wanting to make a difference.  And even then I did not know exactly how I might do it.  I was actually very skeptical of politics because I thought politicians werent always looking out for the people; that too often, I thought, they were looking out for themselves.  So I actually worked in communities to try to hold politicians accountable.  That was the first job that I did in the nonprofit sector. So it wasnt really until I think I finished law school that I thought that I might be interested in public service.  In fact, I went to law school with my now who is my Trade Representative, our Ambassador Michael Froman.  And he was much smarter than me.   But it wasnt until I came out of law school that I thought that maybe I might run for office at some point. But the important point I think I want to make is that so many of the young people here today -- certainly all of you -- well, you sort of qualify as young.   Young at heart.  These two are young.  You're younger than me.  But so many of the young people I meet today I think have a different idea of their careers and their lives.  I think theyre much more sophisticated.  I think the Internet has exposed them to a lot more ideas of what they can do.  I believe that many young people recognize that the old system where you find yourself a job and then you work in that same job for 30 or 40 years is less likely to be the path for them because the economy is just changing so quickly. And so I think theres much more interest on the part of all the young people I meet -- certainly here in Southeast Asia, in the States, Africa, Europe, wherever I go -- to try to make it on their own, and to try to find collaborations with groups of people who are interested in the same things they are, and to see if they can make it happen.  And I think that's a wonderful thing.  It's challenging.  I think one of the well-known rules in Silicon Valley is, is that if you haven't failed quite a bit then you're probably not a very good entrepreneur because the first idea you have is not always going to work.  And you have to be resilient and be able to learn from your failures as much as your successes.  But I truly believe that this generation is not only being entrepreneurial when it thinks about business, but also entrepreneurial when it thinks about trying to solve social problems; entrepreneurial when it thinks about government and making government more responsive and accountable to ordinary people.  And it makes me very hopeful for the future.  Question:  I guess the entrepreneurial spirit is very much engrained in Vietnamese people, just like for Americans.  And you have seen, and just now have seen here the very vibrant startup business community here in Ho Chi Minh City.  Just imagine how much more it can be if there is more exchange, of knowledge, of capital, technical know-how between the two countries, the U.S. and Vietnam.  And on that note, my question for you would be, if your daughter took a gap year from Harvard College, so tells you next week that she wants to live in Vietnam for a year, what would you tell her? President Obama:  Oh, I would encourage it.  But what I've learned is, is that -- my daughter Malia will be 18 next month, and she already doesnt listen to me, whatever I say.  So if you want her to come to Vietnam, I shouldnt be the one to tell her.  Maybe you should tell her. Yes, absolutely.  But certainly I would recommend students from the States to come and study here as much as I'm encouraging Vietnamese students to come and study in the United States. Young people are going to be living in an interconnected world, in a global marketplace.  And every business has to think globally.  Even small businesses.  If you have a good product today, you can reach billions of people if you have a good strategy, you have good marketing, you can handle the logistics. And so the barriers to entry that used to exist where only a Boeing or a GE or a very large company could operate in Vietnam is no longer true.  And the same is true for small businesses here in Vietnam.  If you have an interesting product that is unique and perhaps is very common in Vietnam, but nobody knows about in the United States, oftentimes some of the best ways to start a business is to take something that is very popular in one place but is unknown someplace else and be the first person to sell that product in another country. So I think part of the education that young people have to have is to understand other cultures and understand other markets.  If you're lucky enough to be able to travel, then that's one way to do it.  But one of the wonderful things about the Internet is it gives you an opportunity to learn about another place, even if you can't set foot there.  So that's something that I continually emphasize. Last question or comment. Pham:  I have a question.  In your opening remarks, you mentioned about TPP, and we didnt have a chance to talk about that.  And so TPP is considered a 21st century trade agreement, dealing directly with the digital economy, talking about the rules of law extending to security and privacy and also cost more [inaudible.]  TPP is very important to Vietnam, and I know that the Vietnamese business community supports it.  And as an employee of Microsoft, I can reaffirm that our company supports TPP.  As we look at the latest report published by the U.S. International Trade Commission, that indicates that, fully implemented, TPP will bring about 57 billion dollars into the U.S. economy.  But apparently, the U.S. -- American politics is sort of turning against TPP.  So I'd like to hear from you, what do you think is going to be -- what it takes to pass TPP in Washington, D.C.  And what will you do in your power to make that happen? President Obama:  Well, it's a great question.  And first of all, just to describe why TPP is so important.  What TPP does is it takes 12 countries along the Asia Pacific region that represent a huge portion of the entire worlds marketplace, and it says we're going to create standards for trade and commerce that are fair; that create a level playing field; that have high standards; that encourage rule of law; that encourage protection of intellectual property -- so if Vy or Hang come up with a great idea, somebody is not just going to steal it off the Internet but the work that theyve put in is protected; that has strong environmental provisions so that countries can't just take advantage of no environmental protection to undercut competitors who are following more responsible environmental practices. And not only do all the countries who are participating stand to gain from increased trade, but Vietnam, in particular, I think economists who have studied it believe would be one of the biggest beneficiaries.  From the United States perspective, it's a common-sense thing to do because, frankly, our markets are already more open than many of the markets of the countries that are signing up.  So Japan, for example, is able to sell a lot of cars in the United States but has a lot of problems importing beef from the United States.  And what we've done is to make sure that a lot of the tariffs that are currently being placed on U.S. exports and U.S. goods are reduced.  And so it will create a better environment for U.S. businesses -- particularly because of some of the intellectual property protections, a lot of what we sell today are products of our knowledge-based economy.  And so it's a smart thing to do across the board. Now, the problem in the United States around trade -- and this is not new.  This has been true for the last 30 years -- is that some of the previous trade agreements did not have enforceable labor protections or environmental protections.  I think when China came in to the WTO, it was able to take advantage of the growing global supply chain, and a lot of manufacturing shifted to China in a very visible way.  So a lot of Americans saw companies close and saw what they viewed as their jobs being exported to China.  And some of that happened in Mexico, with NAFTA as well. And so the perception was that this is bad for U.S. workers and U.S. jobs.  If you look at the data, then what is true is that some manufacturing jobs were lost as a consequence of trade. On the other hand, other sectors of the economy improved significantly.  And overall, it was good for the U.S. economy.  But I think that in the design of some of the oil trade deals and some of the mistakes that may have been made in the past, people became suspicious of trade and worried that if we do TPP, then the same pattern will repeat itself, and the U.S. will lose more jobs.  My argument is that if you're dissatisfied with the current trading arrangements where tariffs are placed on U.S. goods but other goods are already coming into the U.S., why would you want to just maintain the status quo?  Why not change it so that everybody is operating in a fair and transparent way?", "filename": "24May2016AddressonEntrepreneurshipatDreamplexinVietnam.txt"}, {"question": "And so thats what I want to briefly talk about before I start taking your questions. As I think all of you know, I have a strong personal connection to this part of the world, to the Asia Pacific and to Southeast Asia.  I was born in Hawaii, spent most of my childhood in Hawaii.  But I also spent time in Indonesia as a young boy.  My sister was born in Jakarta.  So this region helped to shape me.  It is also why I really like the food.   And I have to say that the food I've had since I've been here I've been really happy with. Now, as President, a key part of my foreign policy is to deepen our ties with countries and that peoples of Southeast Asia.  And weve done that.  We've deepened the ties with our allies and our partners.  Weve engaged more with institutions like ASEAN.  Were pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership to grow our economies and to support jobs in our countries.  Together, were promoting peace and encouraging sustainable development.  We're protecting our environment, and trying to meet shared challenges like climate change. But government and businesses are only part of the equation. If were going to meet all of these challenges, we also have to build strong relationships between our people, and especially between young people like you and young people in other ASEAN countries. Keep in mind that here in Vietnam, two-thirds of you were born after 1975.  As I often say to young Americans back home, your generation can look at the world with fresh eyes, without some of the old notions, the old habits of a previous generation. And that gives you the perspective and the power not just to help to grow Vietnam, but also to help shape the world. Thanks to technology and social media, youre the most connected generation in history.  I see it in my daughters, who are always on the phone, and they have to teach me how to use the phone.   More than 30 million people in Vietnam -- one-third of the population -- are on Facebook -- just on Facebook.  Youre posting selfies --  I know.  I was in the gym this morning, people were trying to take selfies.   You're streaming the latest Son Tung MTP hit.  But you're also exchanging ideas and learning from each other. And so this gives you tremendous power.  And we need your passion and energy and talents to tackle some of our biggest global challenges -- whether it's reducing poverty, to advancing equality for women and girls, to fighting climate change. Now, even in this digital age, as Tu pointed out, change doesnt happen overnight.  It requires that you stay active and involved over the long term.  And it requires you to develop some practical tools.  And thats why, three years ago, I launched the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative -- or YSEALI.  And the goal is to empower young people like you with the skills and the resources, and the networks that you need to turn your ideas into action. Since we started this, the YSEALI Network has grown to more than 67,000 members across all 10 ASEAN countries -- including over 13,000 here in Vietnam alone.  And weve welcomed more than 350 YSEALI Fellows to the United States -- including some of you -- with more than 200 coming in the next six months. So a lot of what we do in YSEALI is rooted in the power and importance of education.  Thats why nearly 19,000 Vietnamese students studying in the United States right now are helping to bring back the kinds of skills and talents that Vietnam will need to continue to grow and develop.  Its why, on this visit, we announced a new partnership between American universities like Arizona State and Vietnamese universities to boost training in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine.  Its why we announced that, for the first time, the Peace Corps will be coming to Vietnam, with a focus on teaching English. And its why we announced that were moving ahead this fall with Fulbright University Vietnam, right here in Ho Chi Minh City -- the countrys first nonprofit, independent university.  And the goal is to make sure that Vietnamese students, no matter what their background, has access to a world-class education thats rooted in Vietnams rich culture and fueled by the free exchange of ideas. And I want to thank former Senator Bob Kerrey, who is here, whos been one of the key people to help lead this effort.  Thank you very much, Bob. So all these efforts reflect our belief in you -- in your ability to keep moving Vietnam forward.  And there are some incredible young people who are here who are great examples of the incredible talent and drive of young people in Vietnam today. For example, I see Vietnams promise in Ngan Dang.  Wheres Ngan? Somewhere.  There you are right there. So I had a chance to meet Ngan when I welcomed our YSEALI Fellows to the White House.  She started as a volunteer -- she started a volunteer group to work with street children and orphans, and people with physical disabilities right here in Ho Chi Minh City.  So far, theyve recruited some 450 volunteers, delivered over 7,000 hours of mentoring, built five libraries in two cities.  And that's just one example of the incredible work that's being done by young people right here in Vietnam.  We're very proud of you.  Thank you. A couple other people I want to point out.  We've got Loc Le Xuan.  Wheres Loc?  There he is right there.   So Loc teaches at Ho Chi Minh City Vietnam National University.  Hes a researcher at the Pasteur Institute.  His dream is to go back to his hometown and open a medical center so he can deliver quality, affordable health care.  He also helped start Give2Give, which works with YSEALI members across ASEAN to improve their skills and build stronger networks.  So we're very excited about the work that you're doing, Loc.  Thank you so much. I'm going to close with one more story just to give you an example of the incredible work that's being done by young people. Elizabeth Phu is here, I think, and was born here.  In the aftermath of the war, Liz and her family became refugees -- Liz was barely four years old.  They packed themselves into a boat; they began a dangerous journey.  Pirates ransacked their boat.  But they made it to a refugee camp in Malaysia and, eventually, in 1979, to America.  With just $20 in their pocket, Lizs parents started to build a new life in California.  They taught their children about the importance of education.  And after years of studying and hard work, Liz -- a proud Vietnamese-American -- ended up becoming one of my top advisors on Asia in the White House.  And we've relied on her for all kinds of incredible policy work that we've done over the last several years. So Tu, Ngan, Loc, Liz, so many of you -- you're already showing that you can change the world to reflect our best values. Youre showing that with determination and commitment, and optimism and hard work, anything is possible.  And that's why I'm so hopeful about the future between the United States and Vietnam, that our relationship will continue to grow deeper and stronger.  But I'm also optimistic that you're going to be able to change the region and the world in so many positive ways. So as the great Trn Lp sang, the path to glory days is getting closer. So cam on. So with that, now is the time for me to start taking some questions.  I don't know if youve been briefed, but we have microphones in the audience.  I'm going to just call on people and I'm going to go boy, girl, boy, girl, so it's fair.   If you can keep your questions relatively short, so that we can get as many questions as possible.  And introduce yourself before you ask the question so we know who you are.  Okay?  I'm going to start right here.  We've got a microphone coming.   Question:  Good morning, Mr. President.  I'm from Ho Chi Minh City.  And we are 100 percent Vietnamese-owned company that produce high-end plastic products and components in the supporting industries.  And today it is our honor to meet with the President, and we have an ambition to request for your help -- and that is we would like to be given opportunities to approach the leading enterprises in the United States, especially in the sector of consumer electronics, automotive, and airline industries, and other plastic-related products for supporting industries.  And so, under your help, we could be able to join and be the supplier in the direct supply chain.  And we are committed to share the values of integrity and accountability.  Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama:  Well, thank you so much.  As you know, one of the things that we're really emphasizing is entrepreneurship -- the idea of people starting their own businesses, selling goods across borders, creating jobs, creating great products and services.  And yesterday I had a chance to meet with a number of young Vietnamese entrepreneurs who are already starting to create digital platforms to sell goods not just in Vietnam but also overseas. This is one of the reasons why we're pushing very hard for the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- TPP.  Because what that does is it reduces the barriers between countries for selling their goods and services.  It gives opportunities not just to big companies but also to small companies to enter into the global supply chain.  It raises labor standards and environmental standards so that all countries are working on a level playing field.  And if we can get that done -- and the goal is, I think, to try to complete TPP before the end of this year -- then that will open up a lot of opportunities, and create great confidence among investors here in Vietnam and U.S. companies who are interested in working with young people like you who may have a great idea. Now, my general rule in all this is not to actually broker deals and sign contracts.  That's somebody else's job.  My job is to make sure that we have the kinds of rules in place that make it easier for businesses to get to know each other, to meet.  And one of the things that we're doing with the Vietnamese government is constantly looking for opportunities for trade missions, for businesses to come and learn about what's going on. And so what we'll do is we'll make sure that, through the consulate or through the embassy, if and when we have U.S. businesses who are coming here to Vietnam and are interested in meeting young entrepreneurs, that you'll have an opportunity potentially to present your ideas and see if you can make a deal. All right?  Good luck. All right, it's a gentleman's turn.  All right, this guy.  He looks very happy -- right here. Question: Hello, sir.  I'm a student in Vietnam National University.  I have two questions for you.  The first one is that you are a very great leader, and we are young leaders.  Do you have any advice that how can we be great like you? President Obama:  Oh, wow.  Now, what's the second question? Question:  And the second question is, we are young leaders.  Do you have any suggestion that how can we have to strengthen the relationship between Vietnam and America? President Obama:  First of all, let me tell you, that when I was your age, I was not as well-organized and well-educated and sophisticated as all of you.  When I was young, I fooled around a lot.  I didnt always take my studies very seriously.  And I was more interested in basketball -- and girls.   And I wasnt always that serious.  So you're already way ahead of me.  You're doing good. Whenever I meet with young people and they ask me this question, my most important advice is to find something that you care deeply about, find something that excites you, and put all your energy and effort into it -- because the path for everybody is different.  Some people are very passionate about education.  Some people are very passionate about medicine.  Some people are passionate about business. And so there's no one path to ending up being a leader.  People sometimes think that to be a leader you have to be a great -- you have to make great speeches, or you have to be in politics.  But there are a lot of ways to lead.  Some of the greatest leaders are people who are behind the scenes.  So, for example, in the United States, during the Civil Rights Movement that helped to create opportunities for people like me -- because at the time, African Americans couldnt fully participate in society -- everybody here has heard of Martin Luther King, but there were all these young organizers, your age -- people like Bob Moses and John Lewis, and others who were helping go into poor communities and registering voters, and getting them active and getting them involved.  And they were enormous leaders, amazing leaders -- even though they never made big speeches in front of big crowds. But you have to feel passionate about something.  And one of the things that I always tell young people is, dont worry so much about what you want to be; worry more about what you want to do.  And what I mean by that is, if you are passionate about your work, then naturally over time you are going to rise and people will admire and respect what you've done.  But if all you're thinking about is, I want to be a member of the National Assembly, or I want to be very rich, or I want to be this or I want to be that, then you pay less attention to the actual work in front of you. And most of the people I meet who are very successful, in any field, are people who just love their work.  So Bill Gates, who started Microsoft, he didnt start off thinking, I want to be a multi-billionaire.  He started off thinking, I really like computers and I want to find out how I can create really neat software. I didnt start off thinking I wanted to be President of the United States.  When I finally stopped fooling around and I wanted to get serious, what I decided was that I wanted to help people in low-income communities, poor people, have opportunity. And so I went to work in poor neighborhoods in Chicago.  And because I was interested in the work, I started asking questions: Okay, how can I get more education dollars for these communities? How can I get better housing built in these communities?  And that's when I became more aware of how politics worked.  And I started asking questions about how could I have more influence and how could I build organizations that could potentially deliver the things that I was interested in.  And that's what led me into politics. But I didnt start off saying I want to be President. I started off saying I wanted to help these people. So that's my most important advice.  Decide what it is that you care about deeply, and then put everything you have into doing that.  If you're interested in social media and you want to start a company, then focus on that.  And if you're interested in health care for people in villages around Vietnam, focus on that. And if you get good at that, naturally youll end up being a leader and youll have opportunities to do great things in the future. All right?  Good.  Okay, it's a young ladys turn.  There you go, since you got such a -- when youve got the paddy hat with the Thank you, Obama --   That was good organizing.  So go ahead.   She came prepared. Question:  I am.  So thank you very much, President, for your very inspiring speeches.   I'm from an organization called \"Save Son Doong.\"  So yesterday I literally burst into tears when you mentioned preserving the cave for our children, our grandchildren.  That is something that we have been trying to do for the past few years.  So my question for you is that, because Son Doong does not just belong to Vietnam, it is a world heritage, how would you, an American leader, a global citizen, preserve it?  And you also mentioned that you would like to get back to Vietnam.  If you have a chance to visit Son Doong, would you like to do it on foot by trekking, or would you take a cable car?", "filename": "24May2016YoungLeadersTownHallinVietnam.txt"}, {"question": "President Obama:  Well, that's a beautiful shirt.   Well, first of all, I definitely want to go visit the next time I come.  And I'm a pretty healthy guy, so I can go on foot.  How long is it? Question:  Seven days. President Obama:  Seven days.   Okay, I'm good.  I can do that.  Are there places to get something to eat along the way, or do I have to carry my own food?   Well, no, I'll carry it myself. Well, look, I think the possible designation of a world heritage site is a complex process.  It would involve I think working with the government of Vietnam, with existing organizations that designate world heritage sites.  We'll be happy to work with your organization, with the Vietnamese government and others about the possibilities of doing that. But I do think that one of the great things about your generation is, is that you're already much more conscious about the environment than my generation was or previous generations were.  And that's really important not only to preserve beautiful sites in our countries, but also because economic development and the well-being and the health of your people and everyone around the world is going to depend on how we deal with some of these environmental issues. Now, to some degree, this is not fair, I think it's important to note, because if you think about Western industrial development, before we knew anything about climate change, they used enormous amounts of carbon energy, and we in the United States have a huge carbon footprint and for 100 years, or 150 years, were helping to warm the planet.  So it's not entirely fair, then, to say to countries that are developing now, well, you have to stop because of climate change. But the problem is, is that if a country like Vietnam, or China, or India took the same development path that the West did, we're all going to be under water, because the climate is going to warm up so quickly and the climate patterns are going to change, that, in fact, the terrible consequences could actually impede development rather than advance development. Thats why we had this agreement in Paris to have all countries join together to deal with climate change.  And what it says is, is that each country at different stages of development have different obligations.  The United States, we have to do more.  Countries like China that are large have to do more.  But everybody has to do something.  And we all have an obligation then also to help developing countries find new paths for energy and development that are environmentally friendly, developing clean energy strategies that can leapfrog over the old, dirty industries and immediately go to the clean industries. Now, the good news is I think that can happen.  Because if you think about -- everybody here has a cellphone, right? Everybody has a smartphone?  Yes, you do.  Of course, you do.  Well, in many countries like Vietnam, you didnt start off with a lot of phone towers and digging and laying telephone lines under the ground.  You leapfrogged the old technologies and immediately went to a cellular technology and a wireless technology.  Well, the same thing that we're doing with communications, that's what we need to do with energy. And so, instead of going through the same energy usage in developing and providing electricity and power, we need to start immediately finding cleaner energy sources, which can create jobs and businesses and opportunities all throughout this region.  And I'm very excited about the possibilities of doing that. So we have to think about beautiful areas that need to be preserved. But we also have to recognize that no matter how well we preserve one or two areas in each country, if the overall climate patterns change radically, then we're all going to be in a really difficult situation.  And you're already starting to see the effects of climate change here in Vietnam.  I think this country is going to be one of the most affected.  And in someplace like the Mekong Delta, you have drought on the one hand, but you also have saline intrusion on the other hand.  And that could have a huge impact on Vietnams ability to feed its people, on fishermen, on farmers.  And it could be a really, really big problem if we don't do something about it.  So it's going to be up to you to start, and I'm going to want to partner with you to make that happen. Thanks for the t-shirt also. All right, so lets see.  You got flags and everything.   Gentleman -- right here. Question:  Good morning, President Obama.  I'm from Study Abroad, which brings American students to come to Vietnam to learn.  My question is that, as you said earlier, YSEALI initiative -- and I know that you want to leave the White House very soon, but I'm wondering, when you leave do you come up any plans to handle for the next President to maintain this very good idea?  Thanks. President Obama:  Well, it's a great question.  This is something that we're already planning.  Our expectation is, is that the next President will want to continue the incredible work that we've done with the YSEALI.  It's not just, by the way, young people in Southeast Asia that we're doing this with.  We have a Young Africa Leaders program that involves young people from 50 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  We have a Latin American version that brings young people together.  And at some point, we're going to bring key leaders from each of these areas so that they can start learning from each other. And our hope is, is that the State Department will continue this program.  But one of the things -- people always ask me, what am I going to do after I leave the presidency.  Because I'm so relatively young -- not compared to you, but compared to other Presidents, I'm pretty young.  And I don't know everything that I'm going to do, but the one thing I do know I will continue to work on is developing young leaders in the United States and around the world.  So, in addition to my hope that the next President continues the program through the State Department, I'll make sure that through my philanthropy and my own work that we're continuing to bring young people together so that we can start building the kind of talent that knows each other and is networked and is connected, and is learning from each other.  Because that's what it's going to take for countries in the future to be able to solve these big problems. If you ask me what I'm most excited about in terms of my legacy 20 years from now, I would feel really good if I see 10,000 or 20,000, or 50,000 young leaders who are now taking over governments and businesses and nonprofit organizations, and they now know each other from different countries and theyve worked together, and theyve built trust and theyve built relationships.  And if I can help facilitate that, that would be something that I'd be very proud of.  So you can guarantee that I'll continue to work on this. All right, yes, right here.  Oops.  Is it working?  You might need to use mine.  Okay, there you go.  Just in time. Question:  Good morning, President Obama.  I'm a YSEALI Academy fellow, presently at the University of Montana. President Obama:  Excellent.  How do you like Montana? Question:  It's not cold, it is hot. President Obama:  Oh, it's very cold.  You just haven't -- have you gone through January yet? Question:  Summer. President Obama:  When did you get there? Question:  June through August. President Obama:  Yes, it's not cold in June and August.   You just went there at the right time.  But it's a beautiful state, isn't it? Question: Yes.  I love it. President Obama:  Yes, it's lovely.  You have gorgeous mountains. Have you learned how to fish? Question:  Yes. President Obama:  Fly fishing? Question:  Yes.  I went rafting as well. President Obama:  And rafting also.  That's great. Question:  So my topic is about global environmental issues.  So I'm going to make my professor in Montana happy by asking a question related to climate change and environment.  So in Mekong region, there are a lot of hydropower dams being are being built on the mainstream of the Mekong.  And this problem is not easy because we have big countries and small countries related to the hydropower building in the area.  So do you have any suggestions for all the governments of the Mekong region to get together and suspend in the interests, for the economic and environmental interests? And just one more question.  This is like a very tactical job interview.  Where do you find yourself in five years?  Because I think it is a very interesting period when Malia probably graduates from Howard University and you still holding the computer or iPhone 10.   And also that's when probably maybe Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Hillary or maybe Mr. Trump finish their president term.  So where do you find yourself and the world in five years?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, first of all, on the Mekong Delta, we actually, through ASEAN and the East Asia Summit, created a Mekong Delta working group with all the countries that are impacted.  And through our State Department and various programs, we're working to help them plan and create sustainable development across countries. Now, you're right that one of the big challenges is how do you deal with water resources and the building of dams and hydropower.  And that's not a problem that's unique to the Mekong Delta.  You see this in a lot of parts of the world where big projects get built with unintended consequences, and it has severe effects downstream.  And the results in some cases have been not great.  And they have significant environmental degradation because of lack of planning. So what we're going to try to do is to continue to work with the affected countries and to provide them with the technical assistance and the evaluations of what needs to happen, what they need to watch out for.  And hopefully that information is power. That information then can be used to negotiate on an international level to try to prevent some projects that might have very bad effects. But one of the things that we've seen in ASEAN is when small countries band together as a unit, then their power is magnified. That's true on economic issues; that's true on environmental issues; that's true on security issues.  And we've seen, since I became President, I think a greater willingness of the ASEAN countries to do more substantive work.  It used to be I think ASEAN would meet and everybody was very polite, but you didnt always have I think as many specific, concrete plans of action.  And now you're starting to see I think ASEAN being used as a much more effective tool for policymaking, and the environmental area is a critical place where that can happen. In terms of where I see the world in five years, some of you are going to be doing great things, and I'll be very excited to find out what you're doing.  I suspect that I'm going to be doing the kinds of work that I've been doing all my life.  I'll be doing organizing work and involved in public policy issues.  But I just won't be doing it in a formal way through elected office. I'll be like a community organizer, except a little more famous than I used to be. In terms of American politics, I tend to be positive and optimistic about American politics.  I think sometimes other countries look at our election system and people think, wow, what a mess.  But usually we end up doing okay because the American people are good people, and they -- as I hope you've gotten to know people in Montana -- the American people are generous, and they're decent and they're hardworking.  And sometimes our politics doesnt express all the goodness of the people.  But usually, eventually, the voters make good decisions, and democracy works. So I'm optimistic that we'll get through this period.  And one of the great things about the United States is that even when it makes mistakes, I think it's able to adjust and recognize our mistakes, and then we correct course and take different steps.  So things are going to be okay, I promise. This guy, he has two hands up and a symbol.  I dont know what that means.   I dont know, it was interesting, so we'll call on him.  Maybe he'll explain it. Question:  Hello, Mr. President.  I want to say that you're so handsome. President Obama:  Oh, okay!  Well, you can just stop there if you want. Question:  Okay.  I have two questions of me -- now turn a little bit into business. President Obama:  Business. Question:  Yes.  You told us just find something you deeply care about, and my biggest care about is human resource management or talent management.  And now -- President Obama:  Hotel management, did you say? Question:  Talent management. President Obama:  Talent management.  Got it. Question:  Okay, now we are joining AEC and TPP.  This may not -- beside opportunities, we have many challenges.  The more challenge that -- they have many overseas companies, they want to attract Vietnamese talent.  And can you give a suggestion?  We cannot just base on the patriotism of them to force them to stay in Vietnam.  They have a chance to seek for their own development.  So how can Vietnamese firms and Vietnam government can have them stay and contribute to Vietnam?  And one more question about entrepreneurship.  There is more -- like some company will have lack of human resource because they move from other countries.  And how can the young entrepreneurs can deal with it?  Can you give any suggestion?  Thank you. President Obama:  Okay.  Look, if I understood your question -- so TPP, you've got these new opportunities.  Companies are going to be interested in coming into Vietnam as investors or as business partners with existing Vietnamese companies.  And I think that any good foreign company is going to want to partner with a Vietnamese partner who understands the culture, understands the system.  They're going to be looking for young talent.  And if you start a company that helps to identify talent and is then helping those who are doing business here to recruit, I'm sure that that will go very well. This is not an area that I'm an expert on, but one of the things that we're seeing is, through organizations like -- or companies like LinkedIn -- I dont know if you've heard of that -- based out of Silicon Valley.  But they've been able to build these digital platforms where people are continually updating their rsums and providing their information.  And that becomes a powerful tool then for human resource people who are recruiting.  And it's conceivable that you could do something equivalent to that in Vietnam in preparation for the ongoing growth and development of businesses here in Vietnam. So that's a great idea.  Good luck. In terms of the question on entrepreneurship, I wasnt clear exactly what your question was.  Was it that you think talented Vietnamese are going someplace else instead of staying here?  Is that right? Question:  How can Vietnamese firms and government have places to keep, to retain the talent? President Obama:  To retain talent. Question:  Yes. President Obama:  So you're worried about a brain-drain where -- Question: Yes, brain-drain, yes. President Obama:  -- where young Vietnamese, they get an education and suddenly they're being recruited to go to Australia, or to go to Singapore, or to go the United States, or China, and then you dont have enough entrepreneurs here. Well, look, I think the best way to retain talent in any country is to make sure that talent is rewarded.  And the way to reward talent is to have strong rule of law; to have a good education system; to have the ability to start a business relatively easily; to make sure that government policies when it comes to taxation or when it comes to building infrastructure, that those policies are good ones, and so that people feel as if, by staying here, this is the best place for them to make it. People usually dont want to leave their home countries if they feel like they've got opportunity in their home countries.  Usually, they end up leaving if they feel as if they're stuck in their home countries.  And so one of the benefits of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is it's going to lead to the government taking a series of legal reforms that I actually think will create a better business environment.  And it means for young talented people like you, there's no reason to leave because you're going to be in a position to do great things here in Vietnam. The places that I think lose talent where theres a lot of corruption -- so no matter how hard you work, you always have to pay a bribe or you've got to hire somebody's cousin to get a license to do something -- that ends up frustrating people.  I think people feel frustrated if there's not a good education system, because the truth is, is that not only do you need a good education, but then if you want to start a business, you've got to be able to hire people who also have a good education.  And so you've got to count on the schools training people properly.  You want to have good infrastructure -- proper roads.  And you want to have proper wireless service in order for you to do business in the 21st century. Environmental issues are increasingly important.  I mean, there are some countries where it's actually hard to recruit people because it's hard to breathe in some of the big cities.  You dont want to raise your kids -- no job is so important that it's okay if your children have asthma and they can't breathe.  And so, interestingly enough, if you want the best talent today, you have to pay attention to quality-of-life issues and making sure that people can have clean air and clean water, and they're not being exposed to pollution that may cause cancer, and things like that. So those are all policies that end up making a difference in retaining talent in any country, in any city, in any community. Good.  All right.  Okay, well, we got these young ladies.  They got a flag.  So since you brought a flag, that's -- I'm very impressed with your planning.   Those of you with the hat, with the flag -- it's good organizing. Question:  Hi, my name is Christina, and I'm with my colleague and some of our other colleagues here.  And we work for an American anti-human trafficking NGO called Pacific Links Foundation.  So we fight against human trafficking here in Vietnam.  With Vietnam emerging as an important player in the TPP, many companies will start to shift their production in factories to Vietnam, which will create a new mobile workforce.  With that comes the unfortunate opportunity for human traffickers and labor brokers to take advantage of these workers, such as creating false promises or tricking them or even coercing them into moving across borders, and therefore forcing them into a situation of being trafficked.  What is the United States federal government doing to prevent human trafficking in the global supply chain? Question:  Before you answer, can I ask you a question? President Obama:  I'm sorry, I didnt know -- Question:  Because we had the same -- President Obama:  You're a tag team -- I got you. Question:  Thank you.  Before I came here I asked many -- whenever I met someone I also asked what do you want to ask if you can meet President?  And a lot of questions and a lot of comments.  And for now, I forgot everything, but this remind me about Kenya friend -- and he said if I see you see if he would come to Kenya, and he was pretty excited.  And he said if you could ask please Obama about human trafficking prevents strategy.  Thank you. President Obama:  All right.  Well, let me see.  You lost my train of thought.   Look, the issue of human trafficking is something that we have made a top priority in our State Department and the United States government.  So we have an entire set of policies designed specifically to work with countries to prevent human trafficking.  And we've actually begun making progress in improved enforcement, in improved law enforcement coordination.  NGOs have been very helpful as partners with us in identifying what are some of the paths where people are being exploited. With respect to TPP, it's precisely because we put such an emphasis on this that we actually have provisions in TPP designed to prevent human trafficking.  And it's actually given us leverage to work with some countries to say, if you want to be part of TPP, you have to have a better system in place to prevent human trafficking, including some of these cross-border migrant worker situations. So when I was in Malaysia, for example, meeting with Prime Minister Najib, one of the most important topics as we were negotiating TPP was how could we do more work in order to protect people who are being brought in -- whether it's working at the palm oil plants or what have you -- so that there was better tracking, better enforcement, better protections for people.  And that's in the actual agreement. Now, I think that an agreement on paper is never enough, so there have to be systems in place to monitor what's taking place. And these human traffickers are very clever.  They're like drug traffickers.  If you cut off one path, then try to take another path, and they're always looking to exploit people who are desperate.  So this is why this can't just be a government initiative or a law enforcement initiative.  It has to be something where we're partnering with NGOs, human rights organizations.  We have to be very nimble in how we adapt to changing circumstances so that we're constantly shutting down some of these pathways. The last thing I'll say, though, is one of the best ways for us to reduce human trafficking is to provide more opportunity for people, particularly in rural areas through Southeast Asia.  And if we can give young people in villages a chance to make a living and get an education, and if we particularly focus on women and girls -- because a lot of human trafficking results from the fact that girls are not given the same educational opportunities as boys, and as a consequence, they find themselves in very desperate situations -- the more we can change those dynamics, that will also reduce the ability of people to exploit people who have no hope, or think that they have to leave their village, and are vulnerable then to claims that if you just come with us you're going to be able to get a great job and everything is going to be okay.  And then, by the time they get there, they suddenly find themselves trapped in a very bad situation. Congratulations on the good work you're doing.  I'm very proud of you. Thank you. All right, how much more time we got?  We only got time for one more question?  All right, I'll take two more questions.  But it's a guy's turn first.  I'm going to call on this guy just because I kind of like the yellow in his hair there.  I like the style.   There you go. Question:  Thank you.  I'm a filmmaker, so I'm very interested in personal stories.  And you said before, when you are young you're like fooling around.  And I read on Internet -- I'm not sure if it's true or not -- that you also like smoking weed and things like that. President Obama:  I dont know if that's true. Question:  I wonder what makes you from that guy become a guy who care about the society.  Because a lot of -- I think many young Vietnamese people, they still love like fooling around and they dont really care about the society.  But there must be something that makes you become this person.  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, it's a good question.  I wrote a book about this called, \"Dreams From My Father.\"  I think it was translated into Vietnamese, but I dont know if it's still in bookstores near you.  You know, you never know exactly why something inside you clicks and you decide to take a different path. I think, for me, when I was young -- because I didnt know my father, and I didnt grow up with him in the house -- my grandparents and my mother raised me.  And they were very loving and very generous.  But I think I rebelled in part because I felt that something was missing.  And as I got older I realized that instead of worrying about the father who wasnt there I should worry more about what can I do, and take more responsibility for my own life. And that led me to start studying more, and it led me to start thinking about social issues more.  I grew up.  And why it took me until I was 19 or 20, where some other people like many of you have always been very organized -- like this young lady, I'll bet shes always been very focused -- you don't know why. But I think your point about stories is good.  One of the things that I've learned about being a leader is sometimes we think people are motivated only by money, or theyre only motivated by power, or these very concrete incentives. But people are also inspired by stories.  The stories they tell themselves about whats important and about their lives and about their country and about their communities.  And I think if you want to -- in whatever field you're in, whether it's business or politics or nonprofit work, it's worthwhile to listen to other people and ask them questions about the stories that are important to them, because oftentimes youll find their motivations.  And when we come together to do important things, it's usually because we told a good story about why we should be working together. You think about the United States of America.  We have a really good story called the Declaration of Independence.  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that we're endowed with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  That's a wonderful story.  Theres no -- when the Declaration was made, there really was not United States.  It was just a good story that they were telling about what could be.  And then people were attracted to that story.  And it led to independence, and it led to immigrants from around the world who wanted that vision for themselves -- it led Ho Chi Minh to adapt it when Vietnam was trying to declare independence.  It inspired movements around the world. So, yes, the stories we tell each other are very, very important.  And good luck on making your movies.  Don't believe everything you read on the Internet, though. Okay, last question.  This young lady, she stood up and shes like -- I couldn't say \"no\" to her. She had her hand up.  I thought she was going to hit me if I didnt call on her.  I'm teasing. Question:  Hi.  So I am a rapper here in Saigon, Vietnam. President Obama:  Are you a rapper?  Oh, yes? Question:  You have spoken a lot about environment and like politics and economic progress of Vietnam.  But as an artist, we have a lot to say. President Obama:  Okay. Question:  We have message to say.  I want to know how important it is for a nation to really help and promote their art and culture, and to help its nation in the future. President Obama:  Okay.   Before I answer your question, why don't you give me a little rap?  Lets see what you got.  Come on.  Do you need like a little beat?  Badoom, badoom. Question:  Yes, I do, actually. President Obama:  Go ahead.  Come on. Question:  Vietnamese or English? President Obama:  In Vietnamese, of course. Question:  In Vietnamese? President Obama:  I won't know what it means, but just a short version -- because I got to get going. Question:  [Raps in Vietnamese]  My name is Sue, by the way. President Obama:  Well, that was good.  See there, that was pretty good.  What were you just rapping?  What was your verse there? Question:  I was just talking about some people having a lot of money, having big houses, but actually are they really happy? President Obama:  Okay. Question:  Yeah, a lot of things -- that people look at us and see like different thing and something they assume, or a lot of like stereotypes like me, Asian rapper, looking like a cute girl.  People don't know -- President Obama:  Is that what they think? Question:  But for Vietnamese people, it's different.  They think rapping is not like for women. President Obama:  Ah. Well, that's true in the United States, too. No, no, I just mean that theres always been sort of sexism and gender stereotypes in the music industry like every other part of life. But to answer your question, look, the arts are important.  Artistic expression is important.  It's what I was just saying to the filmmaker about stories that we tell each other.  Music, poetry, representations of life as it is and how it should be -- those are the things that inspire people.  Life is a combination of very practical things, right?", "filename": "24May2016YoungLeadersTownHallinVietnam.txt"}, {"question": "Were here today to declare that the United States and France stand united -- in total solidarity -- to deliver justice to these terrorists and those who sent them, and to defend our nations.  In that spirit, with heavy but strong hearts, I welcome you today. Franois, with your understanding, my statement today will be a little longer than usual. Ive been traveling, and this is an important moment for our nations and for the world.  This barbaric terrorist group -- ISIL, or Daesh -- and its murderous ideology pose a serious threat to all of us.  It cannot be tolerated.  It must be destroyed.  And we must do it together.  This is the unity of purpose that brings us here today. On your visit here last year, you said that the French love America.  We love the French.  Sometimes we Americans are too shy to say so, but were not feeling shy today.  We Americans love France because we dedicate ourselves to the same ideals -- that all people deserve life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  France is our oldest ally.  You helped us win our independence.  We helped liberate France from fascism.  We owe our freedom to each other. We love France for your spirit and your culture, your joie de vivre.  Since the attacks, Americans have recalled their own visits to Paris -- visiting the Eiffel Tower, or walking along the Seine.  We know these places.  Theyre part of our memories, woven into the fabric of our lives and our culture.  I am very grateful to the French people for the hospitality theyve always shown me, and when they welcomed Michelle and our daughters on their first visit to the City of Lights.  By my bed, in the residence, is a picture of me and Michelle in Luxembourg Gardens, kissing.  Those are the memories we have of Paris.  As early on, I had no gray hair. So when tragedy struck that evening, our hearts broke, too.  In that stadium and concert hall, in those restaurants and cafs, we see our own.  In the faces of the French people, we see ourselves.  And thats why so many Americans have embraced the blue, white and red.  Its why Americans, at candlelight vigils, have joined together to sing La Marseillaise.  We have never forgotten how the French people stood with us after 9/11.  And today, we stand with you -- nous sommes tous Franais. Its been noted that the terrorists did not direct their attacks against the French government or military.  Rather, they focused their violence on the very spirit of France -- and by extension, on all liberal democracies.  This was an attack on our free and open societies -- where people come together to celebrate and sing and compete.  In targeting venues where people come together from around the world -- killing citizens of nearly 20 countries, including America -- this was an attack on the very idea that people of different races and religions and backgrounds can live together in peace. In short, this was not only a strike against one of the worlds great cities, it was an attack against the world itself.  Its the same madness that has slaughtered the innocent from Nigeria to the Sinai, from Lebanon to Iraq.  It is a scourge that threatens all of us.  And thats why, for more than a year, the United States, France, and our coalition of some 65 nations have been united in one mission -- to destroy these ISIL terrorists and defeat their vile ideology. Today, President Hollande and I reviewed our coalitions progress.  More than 8,000 airstrikes, combined with local partners on the ground, have pushed ISIL back from territory in both Iraq and Syria.  Today, President Hollande and I agreed that our nations must do even more together.  U.S. assistance has supported recent French strikes in Syria, and were going to keep stepping up that coordination.  And as we saw with the attack in Mali, the terrorist threat goes beyond ISIL.  This week, Ill sign legislation to sustain our support -- including airlift and intelligence -- to allies like France, as we work together to root out terrorist networks in Africa. Well do even more to prevent attacks at home.  Building on our recent intelligence agreement, the United States will continue to quickly share threat information with France.  And in the wake of Paris, and with the threats in Belgium, theres also a growing recognition among European nations that they need to ramp up additional efforts to prevent the flow of foreign terrorist fighters.  As part of that, Im calling on the European Union to finally implement the agreement thats been long in the works that would require airlines to share passenger information, so we can do more to stop foreign terrorist fighters from entering our countries undetected.  And Im prepared to send teams of our experts to work on this with our European partners to make sure were redoubling our efforts together. Regarding the broader crisis in Syria, President Hollande and I agree that Russias strikes against the moderate opposition only bolster the Assad regime, whose brutality has helped to fuel the rise of ISIL.  We agree that Russia could play a more constructive role if it were to shift the focus of its strikes to defeating ISIL.  And likewise, President Hollande and I agree that the best way to bring peace to Syria is through the principles reaffirmed in Vienna, which require active Russian support for a ceasefire and a political transition away from Assad to a democratically elected government that can unite the Syrian people against terrorism. Finally, Franois and I understand that one of our greatest weapons in the fight against ISIL is the strength and resilience of our people.  And, here, I want to speak directly to the American people.  What happened in Paris is truly horrific.  I understand that people worry that something similar could happen here.  I want you to know that we will continue to do everything in our power to defend our nation.  Since 9/11, weve taken extraordinary measures to strengthen our homeland security.  Our counterterrorism, homeland security, and law enforcement professionals -- federal, state and local -- they are tireless.  They have prevented attacks and they have saved lives.  They are working every hour, every day for our security. They did so before Paris, they do so now, and they will not stop.  Theyre the best in the world. But its not just our security professionals who will defeat ISIL and other terrorist groups.  As Americans, we all have a role to play in how we respond to threats.  Groups like ISIL cannot defeat us on the battlefield, so they try to terrorize us at home -- against soft targets, against civilians, against innocent people.  Even as were vigilant, we cannot, and we will not, succumb to fear.  Nor can we allow fear to divide us -- for thats how terrorists win.  We cannot give them the victory of changing how we go about living our lives. The good news is Americans are resilient.  We mourned the lives lost at Fort Hood, the Boston Marathon, at Chattanooga.  But we did not waver.  Our communities have come together.  Weve gone to ballgames and we've gone to concerts, and we've gone shopping.  And men and women who want to serve our country continue to go to military recruiting offices.  We're vigilant, we take precautions, but we go about our business.  To those who want to harm us, our actions have shown that we have too much resolve and too much character.  Americans will not be terrorized. I say all this because another part of being vigilant, another part of defeating terrorists like ISIL, is upholding the rights and freedoms that define our two great republics.  That includes freedom of religion.  That includes equality before the law.  There have been times in our history, in moments of fear, when we have failed to uphold our highest ideals, and it has been to our lasting regret.  We must uphold our ideals now.  Each of us, all of us, must show that America is strengthened by people of every faith and every background. Related to this, I want to note that under President Hollande, France plans to welcome 30,000 additional Syrian refugees over the next two years.  Here in the United States, refugees coming to America go through up to two years of intense security checks, including biometric screening.  Nobody who sets foot in America goes through more screening than refugees.  And were prepared to share these tools with France and our European partners.  As Franois has said, our humanitarian duty to help desperate refugees and our duty to our security -- those duties go hand in hand. On the Statue of Liberty, a gift from the people of France, there are words we know so well:  Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to be free.  Thats the spirit that makes us American.  Thats the spirit that binds us to France. That's the spirit we need today. In closing, I want to salute the people of Paris for showing the world how to stay strong in the face of terrorism.  Even as they grieve, Parisians have begun returning to their cafs, riding the metro, and going to stadiums to cheer for their teams.  Crowds gather in the Place de la Rpublique, including a mother who brought her children -- she said, to let them see that we should not be afraid.  As one Parisian said, Paris will always be Paris. And next week, I will be joining President Hollande and world leaders in Paris for the global climate conference.  What a powerful rebuke to the terrorists it will be when the world stands as one and shows that we will not be deterred from building a better future for our children. So, President Hollande, my fellow Americans -- lets remember weve faced greater threats to our way of life before.  Fascism.  Communism.  A first world war.  A second.  A long Cold War.  Each and every time, we prevailed.  We have prevailed because our way of life is stronger.  Because we stay united.  Because even as we are relentless in the face of evil, we draw on whats best in ourselves and in the character of our countries.  It will be no different this time.  Make no mistake, we will win, and groups like ISIL will lose.  And standing with allies like France, we will continue to show the world the best of American leadership. Vive la France.  And God bless the United States of America. Mr. President. President Hollande: [As interpreted.]  Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me, first and foremost, to thank the President of the United States, Barack Obama, for the solidarity he has shown immediately as we found out about the terror attacks.  He was the first one to call me.  It was very late in France, 2:00 a.m., when Barack called -- the President of the United States. I would like to express his solidarity towards France, his emotion, his compassion against the horror.  And on that night, he meant to tell me that the United States stood by France, that the help that could be provided to France would have no limits, and that we had a duty, a joint duty, to pull our forces together and fight terrorism. I do not forget, either, all of the messages that the American people sent to the French people over the past few days -- the French colors, the French flags all around in many gatherings; these candles in places that represent France here in the United States; La Marseillaise, our National Anthem, sung in official ceremonies.  It is true that in 9/11, we all felt Americans.  But after the 13th of November, Americans felt French.  Our two peoples, together, merged as one, sharing the same emotion and also the same willingness to fight for freedom, to stand for our values. We are not two similar peoples.  We each have our own history.  We have our own culture, our own background.  But we share the same trust, the same faith in freedom.  It is France that came under attack on the 13th of November.  France, for what it is -- a country which we consider unique in the world because France speaks to the world -- France came under attack for what it represents, for what it stands for, for its culture, our way of living, as well as our values, our principles. But by targeting France, the terrorists, the cowardly murderers, we're targeting the world in these restaurants, in these cafs, as well as the Bataclan, that concert venue.  They were men and women, most of them young, who came from 20 countries, at least.  And they shared the same passion for life. And that's the reason why they were murdered. My thoughts are with the friends and family of a young American student, Nohemi Gonzalez, who came as well to share a moment of culture and joy.  My thoughts also go to this American band that was playing at the Bataclan.  Our cultures on that occasion were together to bring the same enthusiasm, and they were hit by terrorists. We are facing a terror group which organizes itself on territory.  They have some substantial resources.  Theyre thriving on smuggling of oil, drug, human beings.  And since the beginning of the year, they hit many countries -- Denmark, Tunisia, Lebanon, Kuwait, Turkey, Egypt, as well as Russia, by taking down a Russian plane. So, together with President Obama, today we wanted on the occasion of that meeting, first of all, to share our determination -- relentless determination -- to fight terrorism everywhere and anywhere.  We also meant to tell the world that we will not allow those who want to destroy what weve built, we will not allow them to do it -- to destroy what weve built, generation after generation.  They will not be able to damage the world.  And against Daesh, we need a joint response, an implacable joint response. France and the United States stand together to bring that joint response.  Militarily, it is about destroying Daesh no matter where they are.  It is about taking out their financing, hunting down their leaders, dismantling their networks, and taking back the land they currently control.  We, therefore, decided, President Obama and myself, to scale up our strikes both in Syria and in Iraq, to broaden our scope, to strengthen our intelligence-sharing regarding the targets we must aim at. The priority is to take back key locations in the hands of Daesh in Syria.  It is also a matter of urgency to close the border between Turkey and Syria, and prevent terrorists from crossing the border and coming to Europe or other places and undertake such terrible attacks.  We also took the decision to work together with our partners of the coalition in Iraq, and to support all of those who are fighting Daesh on the ground. The aim is to make sure that these forces can be supported, helped by all countries that are willing to act militarily to destroy Daesh.  The resolution of the Security Council that was voted unanimously Friday, after being introduced by France and supported by the United States, this resolution provides us with the clear basis to act.  This is what France is currently doing.  Our aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, is currently in the east of Mediterranean, and allows us to enjoy more capability.  Yesterday, for the sixth time after the terror attacks in Paris, we struck Raqqa.  In addition, weve been providing some assistance to Iraqi fighters in the region of Ramadi and in Mosul, within the framework of the coalition. Now, diplomatically, both President Obama and myself have strengthened our cooperation as early as the night after the attacks.  And I would like to commend everything that is being done so that intelligence and information available can be used to tackle terrorists and to follow their movements, so that we prevent them from doing what they want to.  Because beyond Syria and Iraq, what they want is somehow to spread fear everywhere so that we doubt, so that we make decisions which are exactly contrary to what we want in terms of freedom and rights.  But we will not give in.  That being said, we have to defend ourselves and use intelligence. Diplomatically, were working on a credible political transition in Syria within the framework of the Vienna process.  And I commend the work done by ministers Fabius and Kerry to agree a timeline that will enable a ceasefire, of course, as quickly as possible, and to open up to a process that will lead to Bashar al-Assads departure.  Because we cannot imagine the Syrians getting together, gathering around the leader who is responsible for some -- the most of 300,000 dead in a few years.  So a government of unity is required, but that must lead to Assads departure. The Syrian crisis is directly relevant to Europe, first of all, given the terrorist threat, but also because there are millions of refugees fleeing the regimes bombs and Daesh atrocities.  If we were to abandon them, we would betray what we are.  This is the reason why I reject identifying migration and terrorism. At the same time, we must control the borders.  Today, people are risking their lives to flee when they travel at sea between Turkey and Greece.  Turkey, therefore, plays an important role, and it is together with Turkey that we must find solutions so that the refugees can stay close to their country of origin.  And we need to make sure that the required controls, the checks are implemented at the border. On Thursday, I will be traveling to Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin.  And I will tell him that France can work together with Russia if Russia concentrates its military action on Daesh, against ISIL, and if Russia fully commits to the political solution in Syria.  This is what we want to do -- we want to gather all countries, all those who are willing to find and to implement a political solution in Syria.  We do not want to exclude anyone, but we want to make sure that this political solution can eradicate terrorism. Lastly, next week -- that is, on Monday -- we will be hosting, in Paris, the climate conference.  I certainly could not imagine that this conference would be taking place against such a background.  At the same time, I think there cannot be any better symbol or response but to hold the conference in Paris where the attacks took place, where we took the right measures in terms of security protections as well as in defending our values.  There is no greater symbol than holding this conference on climate in Paris with some 150 heads of state and government. Never before did France host so many leaders of the international community.  Theyre coming to sort out the climate challenge, and again, to work and to find the right agreement so that we can limit greenhouse gases emissions and make sure that our children and our grandchildren live better, or simply can live.  But they are also coming to express their support to freedom, to the fight against extremism, that radical Islam which is becoming dangerous. Yes, all of them are coming no matter their background, no matter their religion, their convictions, to express the same principle, the same values with the same word -- life.  Yes, simply life. And this is the reason why I am very pleased that President Obama will allow us to succeed.  I commend his recent statements over the past few weeks and months, but I also commend the commitments hes made in the name of the United States, as well as in the name of the world.  It was very important that one of the most powerful countries in the world, if not the most powerful, and therefore with the highest level of emissions, could also be there to face the future like weve been facing history. What we will be doing early next week in Paris means that we can continue to live, as well as protect our lives and that of all children.  France and the United States, given their history and the values -- the founding values of both our nations, given our spirits, we both have that duty to act as a matter of -- urgently against terrorism and against Daesh, and at the same time, to prepare for the future. Against that background, even though it is a very dire one, Im pleased to be with Barack Obama to send across that message to the entire world. Thank you. Thank you. President Obama:  Weve got time for a few questions.  Im going to start with Roberta Rampton of Reuters. Question:  Thank you.  This is a question for both of you.  First, what is your reaction to Turkey shooting down a Russian plane today?  And does this draw NATO into a confrontation with Russia?  How do you keep this from spiraling out of control? And, President Obama, what does this incident mean for future prospects of military coordination -- more military coordination with Russia?  And, President Hollande, ahead of your trip to Moscow on Thursday, what are the prospects for closer military coordination with Russia, given what happened today? President Obama:  Well, first of all, were still getting the details of what happened.  And I expect to be in communications, potentially directly, with President Erdogan sometime over the next several days. Turkey, like every country, has a right to defend its territory and its airspace.  I think its very important right now for us to make sure that both the Russians and the Turks are talking to each other to find out exactly what happened, and take measures to discourage any kind of escalation. I do think that this points to a ongoing problem with the Russian operations in the sense that they are operating very close to a Turkish border, and they are going after a moderate opposition that are supported by not only Turkey but a wide range of countries.  And if Russia is directing its energies towards Daesh and ISIL, some of those conflicts, or potentials for mistakes or escalation, are less likely to occur. I also think this underscores the importance of us making sure that we move this political track forward as quickly as possible.  Like President Hollande, our view from the start has been that Russia is welcome to be part of this broad-based coalition that weve set up.  Theres never been a point in time in which we said that we dont want Russia or other countries that may have differences with us on a whole host of other things to avoid working with us against ISIL. The challenge has been Russias focus on propping up Assad rather than focusing on ISIL.  I had a conversation with President Putin in Turkey, and I indicated to him at the time that to the extent that they make that strategic shift -- focus on the Vienna process, where they have been constructive, to try to bring all the parties together; try to execute a political transition that all parties would agree to; and refocus attention on going after ISIL -- then theres enormous capacity for us to cooperate. Until that happens, its very difficult.  Its difficult because if their priority is attacking the moderate opposition that might be future members of an inclusive Syrian government, Russia is not going to get the support of us or a range of other members of the coalition. But I do think that there is the possibility of cooperation.  The sooner we agree to this political process, the less likely that you have the kinds of events that took place, apparently, today. President Hollande:  [As interpreted.]  The event that took place is a serious one, and we can only regret it.  Turkey is currently providing all of the information to NATO so that we can find out what truly happened and whether Turkeys airspace indeed was entered into.  But we must prevent an escalation; that would be extremely damageable.  The only purpose is to fight against terrorism and Daesh.  This is what we must do, all of us -- we, Turkey, Russia. And what just took place, like Barack said, means that we must find a solution to the Syrian crisis, because we can see what the risks are otherwise -- the risks of escalation.  I, therefore, will be traveling to Russia this week because we have this resolution of the Security Council and it does show that we must take action against Daesh, against terrorism.  That resolution has been voted unanimously.  In a way, that was the broadest possible coalition. Then, I will ask President Putin, as Ive done before and what I told the Russians a number of times already, that the strikes must be against Daesh, against terrorism, and those who precisely are threatening us.  They are threatening the Russians, like ourselves in Europe, like France that was targeted over the past few days.  We must, therefore, coordinate ourselves, cooperate, but on that basis, and make sure that were all acting against Daesh.  And that will be part of the political process, one that must lead to the solution.  And we all know what the parameters of the solution are or are not.  We know that theres a deadlock today. Lastly, I mentioned the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, which is in the east of the Mediterranean now.  As a matter of fact, there are also some Russian forces.  And I, therefore, agreed with President Putin that we must share our intelligence so that we can act in coordination.  We must not contradict ourselves.  And its already the case, and well continue to do so. Question:  [As interpreted.]  Mr. President, the Americans have some Special Forces in Syria.  Beyond the words and beyond what is happening, are you going to send some Special Forces as well to Syria?  Are you considering some ground intervention there? Mr. President, beyond the emotion that we can feel here, beyond these beautiful statements, for more than a year we heard all of you saying that Assad must go, that a political transition is necessary in Syria.  Mr. President, can you today, here, in front of us, tell us a specific date, a deadline for Assad to go? President Obama:  Who is this addressed to?  Me or for him? Question:  I can translate in English, if needed. President Obama:  No, no, I had the translation.  You said President, and weve got two Presidents here. President Hollande:  [As interpreted.]  I will not provide you with a date because it must be as soon as possible.  That is one of the requirements for a solution to be found.  But at the same time, allow me to underline something.  There is a new mindset now.  The crisis in Syria has been ongoing for four years -- four years.  There are probably more than 300,000 dead.  And this is not just relevant to the countries of the region, which are hosting the refugees.  It is relevant to Europe and the entire world now with that issue of refugees.  And those who believe that we could wait some more, and that, in any case, it was far away, they now realize that we have an influx of refugees, that the terrorists -- the risk is everywhere due to Daesh.  We, therefore, must act. You also asked me what we were going to do, what more.  We will intensify the strikes.  We will have some more specific target to make sure that Daesh resources, their means are cut off, including their command centers, the trucks carrying oil, their training centers where they prepare terror attacks.  We will continue and we will intensify our strikes at the heart of the cities which are currently in the hands of Daesh. France will not intervene militarily on the ground.  It is for the local forces to do so.  We've been supporting them for a number of months.  We will continue to do so.  And they will do the job on the ground after our strikes that will enable them to do so.  But France will take its responsibilities regarding that support, which is absolutely necessary. President Obama:  Let me just make a couple of broader comments about the operations against ISIL.  As was already indicated, we've taken thousands of strikes; have taken thousands of ISIL fighters, including top commanders and leaders, off the battlefield.  We have squeezed their supply lines.  We have empowered and armed local groups that are pushing against them, including, most recently, in Sinjar.  We're providing training and assistance to the Iraqi government as they prepare to retake places like Ramadi that had been overrun. We've seen some success.  But the question now is, how can we accelerate it?  And in fact, even before the tragedy in Paris, I had gathered together my national security forces -- it had been a year -- to review where we had made progress, what worked, what did not, and had put together a plan to accelerate and advance the pressure that we can place on ISIL.  And we intend to execute on those plans, but we also think, as Franois said, that there may be new openness on the part of other coalition members to help resource and provide additional assistance both to the coalition as a whole and to local forces on the ground. With respect to Mr. Assad, I think we've got to let the Vienna process play itself out.  It is our best opportunity.  And so the notion that there would be an immediate date in advance of us getting a broad agreement on that political process and the details I think doesnt make sense.  As soon as we have a framework for a political transition -- potentially, a new constitution, elections -- I think it's in that context that we can start looking at Mr. Assad choosing not to run and potentially seeing a new Syria emerge. But it's going to be hard.  And we should not be under any illusions.  Syria has broken down.  It began to break down the moment that Mr. Assad started killing indiscriminately his own people.  ISIL was able to move into Raqqa in part because of a thorough rejection on the part of many Syrians of the Assad regime, and a power vacuum emerged. And it is going to be a difficult, long, methodical process to bring back together various factions within Syria to maintain a Syrian state and institutions, and to create the kind of stability that allows people to start coming back in and rebuilding their lives.  But it's possible.  And the urgency that we've seen even before Paris out of countries like Russia indicate that they recognize they can't be there too long and ultimately winning military battle successfully. Olivier Knox, Yahoo News. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  [Speaks French.] Mr. President, could you tell us whether the Russian plane did, in fact, breach Turkish airspace?  And given the fury of the Russian response on economic, diplomatic, and rhetorical fronts, how concerned are you that there might also be a military component, if not in Turkey, then perhaps with expanded action against coalition interests inside Syria? [As interpreted.]  And, Mr. President, regarding the measures announced today when it comes to strengthening the cooperation on military intelligence and all this, had they been taken a month or weeks ago, do you think they would have prevented the terror attacks that took place in Paris, or will enable us to prevent some further terror attacks? President Obama:  We don't have all the information yet, so I don't want to comment on the specifics.  We will be gathering all that information.  We expect the Turks to provide information.  I'm sure the Russians will have some information.  And we'll be able to confirm what happened in part through our own intelligence and our own tracking of that border area. As Franois indicated, my top priority is going to be to ensure that this does not  escalate.  And hopefully, this is a moment in which all parties can step back and make a determination as to how their interests are best served. The Russians had several hundred people of their own killed by ISIL.  And the flow of foreign fighters out of Russian areas into Syria poses an enormous, long-term threat to Russian territory.  So there is a potential convergence of interests between the various parties.  It requires us working with them to make the kind of strategic shift thats necessary and that, frankly, Ive talked to Putin about for five years now.  It requires a recognition that the existing structure cannot gain the legitimacy to stop the war, and until you stop the war, youre going to have a vacuum in which these kinds of terrorist organizations can operate more effectively. Let me say one last thing, because Ive tracked the question that you posed to President Hollande about what could or could not have been prevented.  All of our intelligence personnel here in the United States, across the Atlantic, work tirelessly, as I said earlier, to disrupt plots and prevent terrorists attacks.  The vast majority of their successes in disrupting plots are not advertised.  You never hear about them.  But were it not for the dedication of those intelligence and law enforcement and military professionals, this would be a much more dangerous world. So you have to be careful about speculating about what if and could have and would have in a situation like this -- because its hard.  You have eight individuals with light weapons; thats a hard thing to track.  What is true, though, is that we can do a better job of coordinating between countries.  And Ive been talking to our European partners for quite some time now about the need for better intelligence, sharing passenger name records, working to ensure that when people enter into Europe -- particularly now -- that the information across various borders is shared on a timely basis, and you have biometric information and other technologies that can make it more accurate.  It doesnt mean its always going to be 100 percent foolproof, but we can do better on those fronts. And one of the challenges has been, frankly, in the past several years, that you have different legal traditions, concerns about privacy and civil liberties, all of which are entirely legitimate.  I dont think those can be ignored now, because thats part of the -- those are part of the values that make us who we are and that we have to adhere to. But I do think that this is a reminder that this is a dangerous world.  And rooting out small bands of terrorist groups who maintain good operational security and are using modern technologies in ways that are hard to track, that thats a tough job.  And were all going to have to pool our resources much more effectively together than we have in the past.  And I think when Franois goes back to Europe, his leadership, the leadership of other presidents and prime ministers around this issue is going to be as important as anything that we do. President Hollande:  [As interpreted.]  Allow me to go back to what Daesh truly is.  It is somehow an organization, a terrorist group occupying a territory in Iraq and Syria, killing.  And they want to install rules that dishonor humanity.  This is what Daesh is doing there.  And this is what they are trying to do in other countries, everywhere [inaudible] stands. And then we have to deal with the number of networks more or less organized in a number of countries that are being used to lead terror attacks, like was the case precisely in Paris.  We know that this dreadful plan was prepared in Syria, and then organized in a number of countries.  And there are also some accomplices in France, given that some of the terrorists are French, those who committed these acts of war. So if we want to tackle terrorism, we must act not only to destroy Daesh where they are -- in Syria, in Iraq -- but we must also dismantle and destroy these networks.  How can we proceed?  Well, first of all, militarily, by intensifying our strikes, by taking back these territories, thanks to the local forces on the ground, which we can support by finding a political solution in Syria, by making sure that the territorial integrity of Iraq is restored.  This is what we can do. Then, when it comes to protection measures to protect our territory and our people, this is what I announced in France and this is what we have to do to eradicate these networks and all of these accomplices and those who are present.  Some of them just arrived; others have been there for a long time, and they are not necessarily identified as a threat.  It is, therefore, necessary that we strengthen yet further our cooperation in terms of intelligence. The Paris attacks generated a lot of emotion.  But thats not enough -- compassion, solidarity.  And I take note of it, but we must act.  And for a number of days now, Ive been trying to convince -- convincing all the countries that can act to do so. I met with David Cameron yesterday.  He announced that he would take a number of measures to his parliament.  That is important.  Today Im here with Barack so that we can act with greater intensity and coherence, as well.  Tomorrow I will be hosting German Chancellor Angela Merkel so that European countries, including Germany, can face up to their responsibilities, including in terms of military intelligence and police cooperation, and maybe more.  I will also travel to Moscow, so that Russia acts -- can take action against Daesh, and only against Daesh.  And then I will receive Matteo Renzi, the head of the Italian government.  I will also have an opportunity to talk to all of the European leaders, given that a European Council, together with Turkey, will be held on Sunday. So it is all of that that must get together and enable us to implement coordination, cooperation in our actions so that we can act on the source, Daesh, and networks that it can use.  It is that strength that will enable us to succeed. Question:  [As interpreted.]  A question from BFMTV.  Both of you today have talked about coordination, cooperation against Daesh.  Does it mean that this single coalition -- which you mentioned last week, President Hollande -- is gone?  That it is inconceivable to have the Russians and the Americans to work together under this single command? And then Bashar al-Assad, you said you could not put a date on his departure.  Does it mean that his departure is not a preamble or prerequisite for the future of Syria?", "filename": "24November2015JointPressConferencewithFranc\u0327oisHollande.txt"}, {"question": "President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen:  Each year we come together to reaffirm the founding vision of this institution.  For most of recorded history, individual aspirations were subject to the whims of tyrants and empires.  Divisions of race and religion and tribe were settled through the sword and the clash of armies.  The idea that nations and peoples could come together in peace to solve their disputes and advance a common prosperity seemed unimaginable.  It took the awful carnage of two world wars to shift our thinking.  The leaders who built the United Nations were not nave; they did not think this body could eradicate all wars.  But in the wake of millions dead and continents in rubble, and with the development of nuclear weapons that could annihilate a planet, they understood that humanity could not survive the course it was on.  And so they gave us this institution, believing that it could allow us to resolve conflicts, enforce rules of behavior, and build habits of cooperation that would grow stronger over time.  For decades, the United Nations has in fact made a difference -- from helping to eradicate disease, to educating children, to brokering peace.  But like every generation of leaders, we face new and profound challenges, and this body continues to be tested.  The question is whether we possess the wisdom and the courage, as nation-states and members of an international community, to squarely meet those challenges; whether the United Nations can meet the tests of our time. For much of my tenure as President, some of our most urgent challenges have revolved around an increasingly integrated global economy, and our efforts to recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetime.  Now, five years after the global economy collapsed, and thanks to coordinated efforts by the countries here today, jobs are being created, global financial systems have stabilized, and people are once again being lifted out of poverty.  But this progress is fragile and unequal, and we still have work to do together to assure that our citizens can access the opportunities that they need to thrive in the 21st century.  Together, weve also worked to end a decade of war.  Five years ago, nearly 180,000 Americans were serving in harms way, and the war in Iraq was the dominant issue in our relationship with the rest of the world.  Today, all of our troops have left Iraq.  Next year, an international coalition will end its war in Afghanistan, having achieved its mission of dismantling the core of al Qaeda that attacked us on 9/11. For the United States, these new circumstances have also meant shifting away from a perpetual war footing.  Beyond bringing our troops home, we have limited the use of drones so they target only those who pose a continuing, imminent threat to the United States where capture is not feasible, and there is a near certainty of no civilian casualties.  Were transferring detainees to other countries and trying terrorists in courts of law, while working diligently to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay.  And just as we reviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military capabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals, weve begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share.  As a result of this work, and cooperation with allies and partners, the world is more stable than it was five years ago.  But even a glance at todays headlines indicates that dangers remain.  In Kenya, weve seen terrorists target innocent civilians in a crowded shopping mall, and our hearts go out to the families of those who have been affected.  In Pakistan, nearly 100 people were recently killed by suicide bombers outside a church.  In Iraq, killings and car bombs continue to be a terrible part of life.  And meanwhile, al Qaeda has splintered into regional networks and militias, which doesn't give them the capacity at this point to carry out attacks like 9/11, but does pose serious threats to governments and diplomats, businesses and civilians all across the globe. Just as significantly, the convulsions in the Middle East and North Africa have laid bare deep divisions within societies, as an old order is upended and people grapple with what comes next.  Peaceful movements have too often been answered by violence -- from those resisting change and from extremists trying to hijack change.  Sectarian conflict has reemerged.  And the potential spread of weapons of mass destruction continues to cast a shadow over the pursuit of peace.  Nowhere have we seen these trends converge more powerfully than in Syria.  There, peaceful protests against an authoritarian regime were met with repression and slaughter.  In the face of such carnage, many retreated to their sectarian identity -- Alawite and Sunni; Christian and Kurd -- and the situation spiraled into civil war.  The international community recognized the stakes early on, but our response has not matched the scale of the challenge.  Aid cannot keep pace with the suffering of the wounded and displaced.  A peace process is stillborn.  America and others have worked to bolster the moderate opposition, but extremist groups have still taken root to exploit the crisis.  Assads traditional allies have propped him up, citing principles of sovereignty to shield his regime.  And on August 21st, the regime used chemical weapons in an attack that killed more than 1,000 people, including hundreds of children. Now, the crisis in Syria, and the destabilization of the region, goes to the heart of broader challenges that the international community must now confront.  How should we respond to conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa -- conflicts between countries, but also conflicts within them?  How do we address the choice of standing callously by while children are subjected to nerve gas, or embroiling ourselves in someone elses civil war?  What is the role of force in resolving disputes that threaten the stability of the region and undermine all basic standards of civilized conduct?  What is the role of the United Nations and international law in meeting cries for justice? Today, I want to outline where the United States of America stands on these issues.  With respect to Syria, we believe that as a starting point, the international community must enforce the ban on chemical weapons.  When I stated my willingness to order a limited strike against the Assad regime in response to the brazen use of chemical weapons, I did not do so lightly.  I did so because I believe it is in the security interest of the United States and in the interest of the world to meaningfully enforce a prohibition whose origins are older than the United Nations itself.  The ban against the use of chemical weapons, even in war, has been agreed to by 98 percent of humanity.  It is strengthened by the searing memories of soldiers suffocating in the trenches; Jews slaughtered in gas chambers; Iranians poisoned in the many tens of thousands. The evidence is overwhelming that the Assad regime used such weapons on August 21st.  U.N. inspectors gave a clear accounting that advanced rockets fired large quantities of sarin gas at civilians.  These rockets were fired from a regime-controlled neighborhood, and landed in opposition neighborhoods.  Its an insult to human reason -- and to the legitimacy of this institution -- to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack. Now, I know that in the immediate aftermath of the attack there were those who questioned the legitimacy of even a limited strike in the absence of a clear mandate from the Security Council.  But without a credible military threat, the Security Council had demonstrated no inclination to act at all.  However, as Ive discussed with President Putin for over a year, most recently in St. Petersburg, my preference has always been a diplomatic resolution to this issue.  And in the past several weeks, the United States, Russia and our allies have reached an agreement to place Syrias chemical weapons under international control, and then to destroy them. The Syrian government took a first step by giving an accounting of its stockpiles.  Now there must be a strong Security Council resolution to verify that the Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there must be consequences if they fail to do so.  If we cannot agree even on this, then it will show that the United Nations is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws.  On the other hand, if we succeed, it will send a powerful message that the use of chemical weapons has no place in the 21st century, and that this body means what it says. Agreement on chemical weapons should energize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political settlement within Syria.  I do not believe that military action -- by those within Syria, or by external powers -- can achieve a lasting peace.  Nor do I believe that America or any nation should determine who will lead Syria; that is for the Syrian people to decide.  Nevertheless, a leader who slaughtered his citizens and gassed children to death cannot regain the legitimacy to lead a badly fractured country.  The notion that Syria can somehow return to a pre-war status quo is a fantasy.  Its time for Russia and Iran to realize that insisting on Assads rule will lead directly to the outcome that they fear:  an increasingly violent space for extremists to operate.  In turn, those of us who continue to support the moderate opposition must persuade them that the Syrian people cannot afford a collapse of state institutions, and that a political settlement cannot be reached without addressing the legitimate fears and concerns of Alawites and other minorities. We are committed to working this political track.  And as we pursue a settlement, lets remember this is not a zero-sum endeavor.  Were no longer in a Cold War.  Theres no Great Game to be won, nor does America have any interest in Syria beyond the wellbeing of its people, the stability of its neighbors, the elimination of chemical weapons, and ensuring that it does not become a safe haven for terrorists.  I welcome the influence of all nations that can help bring about a peaceful resolution of Syrias civil war.  And as we move the Geneva process forward, I urge all nations here to step up to meet humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding countries.  America has committed over a billion dollars to this effort, and today I can announce that we will be providing an additional $340 million.  No aid can take the place of a political resolution that gives the Syrian people the chance to rebuild their country, but it can help desperate people to survive. What broader conclusions can be drawn from Americas policy toward Syria?  I know there are those who have been frustrated by our unwillingness to use our military might to depose Assad, and believe that a failure to do so indicates a weakening of American resolve in the region.  Others have suggested that my willingness to direct even limited military strikes to deter the further use of chemical weapons shows weve learned nothing from Iraq, and that America continues to seek control over the Middle East for our own purposes.  In this way, the situation in Syria mirrors a contradiction that has persisted in the region for decades:  the United States is chastised for meddling in the region, accused of having a hand in all manner of conspiracy; at the same time, the United States is blamed for failing to do enough to solve the regions problems and for showing indifference toward suffering Muslim populations. I realize some of this is inevitable, given Americas role in the world.  But these contradictory attitudes have a practical impact on the American peoples support for our involvement in the region, and allow leaders in the region -- as well as the international community sometimes -- to avoid addressing difficult problems themselves.  So let me take this opportunity to outline what has been U.S. policy towards the Middle East and North Africa, and what will be my policy during the remainder of my presidency. The United States of America is prepared to use all elements of our power, including military force, to secure our core interests in the region.  We will confront external aggression against our allies and partners, as we did in the Gulf War. We will ensure the free flow of energy from the region to the world.  Although America is steadily reducing our own dependence on imported oil, the world still depends on the regions energy supply, and a severe disruption could destabilize the entire global economy. We will dismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people.  Wherever possible, we will build the capacity of our partners, respect the sovereignty of nations, and work to address the root causes of terror.  But when its necessary to defend the United States against terrorist attack, we will take direct action. And finally, we will not tolerate the development or use of weapons of mass destruction.  Just as we consider the use of chemical weapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national security, we reject the development of nuclear weapons that could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region, and undermine the global nonproliferation regime. Now, to say that these are Americas core interests is not to say that they are our only interests.  We deeply believe it is in our interests to see a Middle East and North Africa that is peaceful and prosperous, and will continue to promote democracy and human rights and open markets, because we believe these practices achieve peace and prosperity.  But I also believe that we can rarely achieve these objectives through unilateral American action, particularly through military action.  Iraq shows us that democracy cannot simply be imposed by force.  Rather, these objectives are best achieved when we partner with the international community and with the countries and peoples of the region. So what does this mean going forward?  In the near term, Americas diplomatic efforts will focus on two particular issues:  Irans pursuit of nuclear weapons, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.  While these issues are not the cause of all the regions problems, they have been a major source of instability for far too long, and resolving them can help serve as a foundation for a broader peace. The United States and Iran have been isolated from one another since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.  This mistrust has deep roots.  Iranians have long complained of a history of U.S. interference in their affairs and of Americas role in overthrowing an Iranian government during the Cold War.  On the other hand, Americans see an Iranian government that has declared the United States an enemy and directly -- or through proxies -- taken American hostages, killed U.S. troops and civilians, and threatened our ally Israel with destruction. I dont believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight -- the suspicions run too deep.  But I do believe that if we can resolve the issue of Irans nuclear program, that can serve as a major step down a long road towards a different relationship, one based on mutual interests and mutual respect. Since I took office, Ive made it clear in letters to the Supreme Leader in Iran and more recently to President Rouhani that America prefers to resolve our concerns over Irans nuclear program peacefully, although we are determined to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.  We are not seeking regime change and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy.  Instead, we insist that the Iranian government meet its responsibilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and U.N. Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, the Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the development of nuclear weapons, and President Rouhani has just recently reiterated that the Islamic Republic will never develop a nuclear weapon. So these statements made by our respective governments should offer the basis for a meaningful agreement.  We should be able to achieve a resolution that respects the rights of the Iranian people, while giving the world confidence that the Iranian program is peaceful.  But to succeed, conciliatory words will have to be matched by actions that are transparent and verifiable.  After all, it's the Iranian governments choices that have led to the comprehensive sanctions that are currently in place.  And this is not simply an issue between the United States and Iran.  The world has seen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past and has an abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its obligations in the future.    But I want to be clear we are encouraged that President Rouhani received from the Iranian people a mandate to pursue a more moderate course.  And given President Rouhanis stated commitment to reach an agreement, I am directing John Kerry to pursue this effort with the Iranian government in close cooperation with the European Union -- the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia and China.  The roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly believe the diplomatic path must be tested.  For while the status quo will only deepen Irans isolation, Irans genuine commitment to go down a different path will be good for the region and the world, and will help the Iranian people meet their extraordinary potential -- in commerce and culture; in science and education. We are also determined to resolve a conflict that goes back even further than our differences with Iran, and that is the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.  Ive made it clear that the United States will never compromise our commitment to Israels security, nor our support for its existence as a Jewish state.  Earlier this year, in Jerusalem, I was inspired by young Israelis who stood up for the belief that peace was necessary, just, and possible.  And I believe theres a growing recognition within Israel that the occupation of the West Bank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish state.  But the children of Israel have the right to live in a world where the nations assembled in this body fully recognize their country, and where we unequivocally reject those who fire rockets at their homes or incite others to hate them. Likewise, the United States remains committed to the belief that the Palestinian people have a right to live with security and dignity in their own sovereign state.  On the same trip, I had the opportunity to meet with young Palestinians in Ramallah whose ambition and incredible potential are matched by the pain they feel in having no firm place in the community of nations.  They are understandably cynical that real progress will ever be made, and theyre frustrated by their families enduring the daily indignity of occupation.  But they too recognize that two states is the only real path to peace -- because just as the Palestinian people must not be displaced, the state of Israel is here to stay. So the time is now ripe for the entire international community to get behind the pursuit of peace.  Already, Israeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a willingness to take significant political risks.  President Abbas has put aside efforts to short-cut the pursuit of peace and come to the negotiating table.  Prime Minister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners and reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian state.  Current talks are focused on final status issues of borders and security, refugees and Jerusalem. So now the rest of us must be willing to take risks as well.  Friends of Israel, including the United States, must recognize that Israels security as a Jewish and democratic state depends upon the realization of a Palestinian state, and we should say so clearly.  Arab states, and those who supported the Palestinians, must recognize that stability will only be served through a two-state solution and a secure Israel.  All of us must recognize that peace will be a powerful tool to defeat extremists throughout the region, and embolden those who are prepared to build a better future.  And moreover, ties of trade and commerce between Israelis and Arabs could be an engine of growth and opportunity at a time when too many young people in the region are languishing without work.  So lets emerge from the familiar corners of blame and prejudice.  Lets support Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk the difficult road to peace. Real breakthroughs on these two issues -- Irans nuclear program, and Israeli-Palestinian peace -- would have a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle East and North Africa.  But the current convulsions arising out of the Arab Spring remind us that a just and lasting peace cannot be measured only by agreements between nations.  It must also be measured by our ability to resolve conflict and promote justice within nations.  And by that measure, its clear that all of us have a lot more work to do.  When peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and Egypt, the entire world was filled with hope.  And although the United States -- like others -- was struck by the speed of transition, and although we did not -- and in fact could not -- dictate events, we chose to support those who called for change.  And we did so based on the belief that while these transitions will be hard and take time, societies based upon democracy and openness and the dignity of the individual will ultimately be more stable, more prosperous, and more peaceful.  Over the last few years, particularly in Egypt, weve seen just how hard this transition will be.  Mohamed Morsi was democratically elected, but proved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was fully inclusive.  The interim government that replaced him responded to the desires of millions of Egyptians who believed the revolution had taken a wrong turn, but it, too, has made decisions inconsistent with inclusive democracy -- through an emergency law, and restrictions on the press and civil society and opposition parties. Of course, America has been attacked by all sides of this internal conflict, simultaneously accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, and engineering their removal of power.  In fact, the United States has purposely avoided choosing sides.  Our overriding interest throughout these past few years has been to encourage a government that legitimately reflects the will of the Egyptian people, and recognizes true democracy as requiring a respect for minority rights and the rule of law, freedom of speech and assembly, and a strong civil society. That remains our interest today.  And so, going forward, the United States will maintain a constructive relationship with the interim government that promotes core interests like the Camp David Accords and counterterrorism.  Well continue support in areas like education that directly benefit the Egyptian people.  But we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain military systems, and our support will depend upon Egypts progress in pursuing a more democratic path.  And our approach to Egypt reflects a larger point:  The United States will at times work with governments that do not meet, at least in our view, the highest international expectations, but who work with us on our core interests.  Nevertheless, we will not stop asserting principles that are consistent with our ideals, whether that means opposing the use of violence as a means of suppressing dissent, or supporting the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  We will reject the notion that these principles are simply Western exports, incompatible with Islam or the Arab World.  We believe they are the birthright of every person.  And while we recognize that our influence will at times be limited, although we will be wary of efforts to impose democracy through military force, and although we will at times be accused of hypocrisy and inconsistency, we will be engaged in the region for the long haul.  For the hard work of forging freedom and democracy is the task of a generation. And this includes efforts to resolve sectarian tensions that continue to surface in places like Iraq, Bahrain and Syria.  We understand such longstanding issues cannot be solved by outsiders; they must be addressed by Muslim communities themselves.  But weve seen grinding conflicts come to an end before -- most recently in Northern Ireland, where Catholics and Protestants finally recognized that an endless cycle of conflict was causing both communities to fall behind a fast-moving world.  And so we believe those same sectarian conflicts can be overcome in the Middle East and North Africa.  To summarize, the United States has a hard-earned humility when it comes to our ability to determine events inside other countries.  The notion of American empire may be useful propaganda, but it isnt borne out by Americas current policy or by public opinion.  Indeed, as recent debates within the United States over Syria clearly show, the danger for the world is not an America that is too eager to immerse itself in the affairs of other countries or to take on every problem in the region as its own.  The danger for the world is that the United States, after a decade of war -- rightly concerned about issues back home, aware of the hostility that our engagement in the region has engendered throughout the Muslim world -- may disengage, creating a vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to fill. I believe such disengagement would be a mistake.  I believe America must remain engaged for our own security.  But I also believe the world is better for it.  Some may disagree, but I believe America is exceptional -- in part because we have shown a willingness through the sacrifice of blood and treasure to stand up not only for our own narrow self-interests, but for the interests of all.  I must be honest, though.  We're far more likely to invest our energy in those countries that want to work with us, that invest in their people instead of a corrupt few; that embrace a vision of society where everyone can contribute -- men and women, Shia or Sunni, Muslim, Christian or Jew.  Because from Europe to Asia, from Africa to the Americas, nations that have persevered on a democratic path have emerged more prosperous, more peaceful, and more invested in upholding our common security and our common humanity.  And I believe that the same will hold true for the Arab world. This leads me to a final point.  There will be times when the breakdown of societies is so great, the violence against civilians so substantial that the international community will be called upon to act.  This will require new thinking and some very tough choices.  While the United Nations was designed to prevent wars between states, increasingly we face the challenge of preventing slaughter within states.  And these challenges will grow more pronounced as we are confronted with states that are fragile or failing -- places where horrendous violence can put innocent men, women and children at risk, with no hope of protection from their national institutions. I have made it clear that even when Americas core interests are not directly threatened, we stand ready to do our part to prevent mass atrocities and protect basic human rights.  But we cannot and should not bear that burden alone.  In Mali, we supported both the French intervention that successfully pushed back al Qaeda, and the African forces who are keeping the peace.  In Eastern Africa, we are working with partners to bring the Lords Resistance Army to an end.  And in Libya, when the Security Council provided a mandate to protect civilians, America joined a coalition that took action.  Because of what we did there, countless lives were saved, and a tyrant could not kill his way back to power. I know that some now criticize the action in Libya as an object lesson.  They point to the problems that the country now confronts -- a democratically elected government struggling to provide security; armed groups, in some places extremists, ruling parts of a fractured land.  And so these critics argue that any intervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail -- look at Libya.  No one is more mindful of these problems than I am, for they resulted in the death of four outstanding U.S. citizens who were committed to the Libyan people, including Ambassador Chris Stevens -- a man whose courageous efforts helped save the city of Benghazi.  But does anyone truly believe that the situation in Libya would be better if Qaddafi had been allowed to kill, imprison, or brutalize his people into submission?  Its far more likely that without international action, Libya would now be engulfed in civil war and bloodshed. We live in a world of imperfect choices.  Different nations will not agree on the need for action in every instance, and the principle of sovereignty is at the center of our international order.  But sovereignty cannot be a shield for tyrants to commit wanton murder, or an excuse for the international community to turn a blind eye.  While we need to be modest in our belief that we can remedy every evil, while we need to be mindful that the world is full of unintended consequences, should we really accept the notion that the world is powerless in the face of a Rwanda or Srebrenica?  If thats the world that people want to live in, they should say so and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves. But I believe we can embrace a different future.  And if we dont want to choose between inaction and war, we must get better -- all of us -- at the policies that prevent the breakdown of basic order.  Through respect for the responsibilities of nations and the rights of individuals.  Through meaningful sanctions for those who break the rules.  Through dogged diplomacy that resolves the root causes of conflict, not merely its aftermath.  Through development assistance that brings hope to the marginalized.  And yes, sometimes -- although this will not be enough -- there are going to be moments where the international community will need to acknowledge that the multilateral use of military force may be required to prevent the very worst from occurring. Ultimately, this is the international community that America seeks -- one where nations do not covet the land or resources of other nations, but one in which we carry out the founding purpose of this institution and where we all take responsibility.  A world in which the rules established out of the horrors of war can help us resolve conflicts peacefully, and prevent the kinds of wars that our forefathers fought.  A world where human beings can live with dignity and meet their basic needs, whether they live in New York or Nairobi; in Peshawar or Damascus. These are extraordinary times, with extraordinary opportunities.  Thanks to human progress, a child born anywhere on Earth today can do things today that 60 years ago would have been out of reach for the mass of humanity.  I saw this in Africa, where nations moving beyond conflict are now poised to take off.  And America is with them, partnering to feed the hungry and care for the sick, and to bring power to places off the grid. I see it across the Pacific region, where hundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in a single generation.  I see it in the faces of young people everywhere who can access the entire world with the click of a button, and who are eager to join the cause of eradicating extreme poverty, and combating climate change, starting businesses, expanding freedom, and leaving behind the old ideological battles of the past.  Thats whats happening in Asia and Africa.  Its happening in Europe and across the Americas.  Thats the future that the people of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as well -- one where they can focus on opportunity, instead of whether theyll be killed or repressed because of who they are or what they believe. Time and again, nations and people have shown our capacity to change -- to live up to humanitys highest ideals, to choose our better history.  Last month, I stood where 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. told America about his dream, at a time when many people of my race could not even vote for President.  Earlier this year, I stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured decades cut off from his own people and the world.  Who are we to believe that todays challenges cannot be overcome, when we have seen what changes the human spirit can bring?  Who in this hall can argue that the future belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit, rather than those who seek to liberate it?", "filename": "24September2013UnitedNations68thSessionGeneralAssemblySpeech.txt"}, {"question": "President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen:  We come together at a crossroads between war and peace; between disorder and integration; between fear and hope. Around the globe, there are signposts of progress.  The shadow of World War that existed at the founding of this institution has been lifted, and the prospect of war between major powers reduced.  The ranks of member states has more than tripled, and more people live under governments they elected. Hundreds of millions of human beings have been freed from the prison of poverty, with the proportion of those living in extreme poverty cut in half.  And the world economy continues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis of our lives.  Today, whether you live in downtown Manhattan or in my grandmothers village more than 200 miles from Nairobi, you can hold in your hand more information than the worlds greatest libraries.  Together, weve learned how to cure disease and harness the power of the wind and the sun.  The very existence of this institution is a unique achievement -- the people of the world committing to resolve their differences peacefully, and to solve their problems together.  I often tell young people in the United States that despite the headlines, this is the best time in human history to be born, for you are more likely than ever before to be literate, to be healthy, to be free to pursue your dreams. And yet there is a pervasive unease in our world -- a sense that the very forces that have brought us together have created new dangers and made it difficult for any single nation to insulate itself from global forces.  As we gather here, an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public health systems in West Africa and threatens to move rapidly across borders.  Russian aggression in Europe recalls the days when large nations trampled small ones in pursuit of territorial ambition.  The brutality of terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the heart of darkness. Each of these problems demands urgent attention.  But they are also symptoms of a broader problem -- the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world. We, collectively, have not invested adequately in the public health capacity of developing countries.  Too often, we have failed to enforce international norms when its inconvenient to do so.  And we have not confronted forcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism, and hopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many parts of the globe. Fellow delegates, we come together as united nations with a choice to make.  We can renew the international system that has enabled so much progress, or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back by an undertow of instability.  We can reaffirm our collective responsibility to confront global problems, or be swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability.  And for America, the choice is clear:  We choose hope over fear.  We see the future not as something out of our control, but as something we can shape for the better through concerted and collective effort.  We reject fatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs.  We choose to work for the world as it should be, as our children deserve it to be. There is much that must be done to meet the test of this moment.  But today Id like to focus on two defining questions at the root of so many of our challenges -- whether the nations here today will be able to renew the purpose of the UNs founding; and whether we will come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism.   First, all of us -- big nations and small -- must meet our responsibility to observe and enforce international norms.  We are here because others realized that we gain more from cooperation than conquest.  One hundred years ago, a World War claimed the lives of many millions, proving that with the terrible power of modern weaponry, the cause of empire ultimately leads to the graveyard.  It would take another World War to roll back the forces of fascism, the notions of racial supremacy, and form this United Nations to ensure that no nation can subjugate its neighbors and claim their territory.  Recently, Russias actions in Ukraine challenge this post-war order.  Here are the facts.  After the people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and calls for reform, their corrupt president fled.  Against the will of the government in Kyiv, Crimea was annexed.  Russia poured arms into eastern Ukraine, fueling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed thousands.  When a civilian airliner was shot down from areas that these proxies controlled, they refused to allow access to the crash for days.  When Ukraine started to reassert control over its territory, Russia gave up the pretense of merely supporting the separatists, and moved troops across the border. This is a vision of the world in which might makes right -- a world in which one nations borders can be redrawn by another, and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed. America stands for something different.  We believe that right makes might -- that bigger nations should not be able to bully smaller ones, and that people should be able to choose their own future. And these are simple truths, but they must be defended. America and our allies will support the people of Ukraine as they develop their democracy and economy.  We will reinforce our NATO Allies and uphold our commitment to collective self-defense.  We will impose a cost on Russia for aggression, and we will counter falsehoods with the truth.  And we call upon others to join us on the right side of history -- for while small gains can be won at the barrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if enough voices support the freedom of nations and peoples to make their own decisions. Moreover, a different path is available -- the path of diplomacy and peace, and the ideals this institution is designed to uphold.  The recent cease-fire agreement in Ukraine offers an opening to achieve those objectives.  If Russia takes that path -- a path that for stretches of the post-Cold War period resulted in prosperity for the Russian people -- then we will lift our sanctions and welcome Russias role in addressing common challenges.  After all, thats what the United States and Russia have been able to do in past years -- from reducing our nuclear stockpiles to meeting our obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to cooperating to remove and destroy Syrias declared chemical weapons.  And thats the kind of cooperation we are prepared to pursue again -- if Russia changes course.  This speaks to a central question of our global age -- whether we will solve our problems together, in a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect, or whether we descend into the destructive rivalries of the past.  When nations find common ground, not simply based on power, but on principle, then we can make enormous progress.  And I stand before you today committed to investing American strength to working with all nations to address the problems we face in the 21st century. As we speak, America is deploying our doctors and scientists -- supported by our military -- to help contain the outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments.  But we need a broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, destabilize economies, and move rapidly across borders.  Its easy to see this as a distant problem -- until it is not.  And that is why we will continue to mobilize other countries to join us in making concrete commitments, significant commitments to fight this outbreak, and enhance our system of global health security for the long term. America is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue, as part of our commitment to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace and security of a world without them.  And this can only take place if Iran seizes this historic opportunity.  My message to Irans leaders and people has been simple and consistent:  Do not let this opportunity pass.  We can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful.  America is and will continue to be a Pacific power, promoting peace, stability, and the free flow of commerce among nations.  But we will insist that all nations abide by the rules of the road, and resolve their territorial disputes peacefully, consistent with international law.  Thats how the Asia-Pacific has grown.  And thats the only way to protect this progress going forward.  America is committed to a development agenda that eradicates extreme poverty by 2030.  We will do our part to help people feed themselves, power their economies, and care for their sick.  If the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity.  America is pursuing ambitious reductions in our carbon emissions, and weve increased our investments in clean energy. We will do our part, and help developing nations do theirs.  But the science tells us we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every other nation, by every major power.  Thats how we can protect this planet for our children and our grandchildren. In other words, on issue after issue, we cannot rely on a rule book written for a different century.  If we lift our eyes beyond our borders -- if we think globally and if we act cooperatively -- we can shape the course of this century, as our predecessors shaped the post-World War II age.  But as we look to the future, one issue risks a cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress, and that is the cancer of violent extremism that has ravaged so many parts of the Muslim world. Of course, terrorism is not new.  Speaking before this Assembly, President Kennedy put it well:  Terror is not a new weapon, he said.  Throughout history it has been used by those who could not prevail, either by persuasion or example.  In the 20th century, terror was used by all manner of groups who failed to come to power through public support.  But in this century, we have faced a more lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have perverted one of the worlds great religions.  With access to technology that allows small groups to do great harm, they have embraced a nightmarish vision that would divide the world into adherents and infidels -- killing as many innocent civilians as possible, employing the most brutal methods to intimidate people within their communities. I have made it clear that America will not base our entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism.  Instead, weve waged a focused campaign against al Qaeda and its associated forces -- taking out their leaders, denying them the safe havens they rely on.  At the same time, we have reaffirmed again and again that the United States is not and never will be at war with Islam.  Islam teaches peace.  Muslims the world over aspire to live with dignity and a sense of justice.  And when it comes to America and Islam, there is no us and them, there is only us -- because millions of Muslim Americans are part of the fabric of our country. So we reject any suggestion of a clash of civilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or create anything, and therefore peddle only fanaticism and hate.  And it is no exaggeration to say that humanitys future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or sect, race or religion. But this is not simply a matter of words.  Collectively, we must take concrete steps to address the danger posed by religiously motivated fanatics, and the trends that fuel their recruitment.  Moreover, this campaign against extremism goes beyond a narrow security challenge.  For while weve degraded methodically core al Qaeda and supported a transition to a sovereign Afghan government, extremist ideology has shifted to other places -- particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, where a quarter of young people have no job, where food and water could grow scarce, where corruption is rampant and sectarian conflicts have become increasingly hard to contain.   As an international community, we must meet this challenge with a focus on four areas.  First, the terrorist group known as ISIL must be degraded and ultimately destroyed. This group has terrorized all who they come across in Iraq and Syria.  Mothers, sisters, daughters have been subjected to rape as a weapon of war.  Innocent children have been gunned down.  Bodies have been dumped in mass graves.  Religious minorities have been starved to death.  In the most horrific crimes imaginable, innocent human beings have been beheaded, with videos of the atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the world. No God condones this terror.  No grievance justifies these actions.  There can be no reasoning -- no negotiation -- with this brand of evil.  The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force.  So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.  In this effort, we do not act alone -- nor do we intend to send U.S. troops to occupy foreign lands.  Instead, we will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim their communities.  We will use our military might in a campaign of airstrikes to roll back ISIL.  We will train and equip forces fighting against these terrorists on the ground.  We will work to cut off their financing, and to stop the flow of fighters into and out of the region.  And already, over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition.  Today, I ask the world to join in this effort.  Those who have joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they can.  Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone.  For we will not succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that the future belongs to those who build -- not those who destroy.  So that's an immediate challenge, the first challenge that we must meet. The second:  It is time for the world -- especially Muslim communities -- to explicitly, forcefully, and consistently reject the ideology of organizations like al Qaeda and ISIL. It is one of the tasks of all great religions to accommodate devout faith with a modern, multicultural world.  No children are born hating, and no children -- anywhere -- should be educated to hate other people.  There should be no more tolerance of so-called clerics who call upon people to harm innocents because theyre Jewish, or because they're Christian, or because they're Muslim.  It is time for a new compact among the civilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its most fundamental source, and that is the corruption of young minds by violent ideology. That means cutting off the funding that fuels this hate.  Its time to end the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down. That means contesting the space that terrorists occupy, including the Internet and social media.  Their propaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad to fight their wars, and turned students -- young people full of potential -- into suicide bombers.  We must offer an alternative vision. That means bringing people of different faiths together.  All religions have been attacked by extremists from within at some point, and all people of faith have a responsibility to lift up the value at the heart of all great religions:  Do unto thy neighbor as you would do -- you would have done unto yourself. The ideology of ISIL or al Qaeda or Boko Haram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed and confronted and refuted in the light of day.  Look at the new Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies -- Sheikh bin Bayyah described its purpose:  We must declare war on war, so the outcome will be peace upon peace.  Look at the young British Muslims who responded to terrorist propaganda by starting the NotInMyName campaign, declaring, ISIS is hiding behind a false Islam.  Look at the Christian and Muslim leaders who came together in the Central African Republic to reject violence; listen to the Imam who said, Politics try to divide the religious in our country, but religion shouldnt be a cause of hate, war, or strife. Later today, the Security Council will adopt a resolution that underscores the responsibility of states to counter violent extremism.  But resolutions must be followed by tangible commitments, so were accountable when we fall short.  Next year, we should all be prepared to announce the concrete steps that we have taken to counter extremist ideologies in our own countries -- by getting intolerance out of schools, stopping radicalization before it spreads, and promoting institutions and programs that build new bridges of understanding. Third, we must address the cycle of conflict -- especially sectarian conflict -- that creates the conditions that terrorists prey upon. There is nothing new about wars within religions.  Christianity endured centuries of vicious sectarian conflict.  Today, it is violence within Muslim communities that has become the source of so much human misery.  It is time to acknowledge the destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror campaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle East.  And it is time that political, civic and religious leaders reject sectarian strife.  So lets be clear:  This is a fight that no one is winning.  A brutal civil war in Syria has already killed nearly 200,000 people, displaced millions.  Iraq has come perilously close to plunging back into the abyss.  The conflict has created a fertile recruiting ground for terrorists who inevitably export this violence. The good news is we also see signs that this tide could be reversed.  We have a new, inclusive government in Baghdad; a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed by his neighbors; Lebanese factions rejecting those who try to provoke war.  And these steps must be followed by a broader truce.  Nowhere is this more necessary than Syria.  Together with our partners, America is training and equipping the Syrian opposition to be a counterweight to the terrorists of ISIL and the brutality of the Assad regime.  But the only lasting solution to Syrias civil war is political -- an inclusive political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of creed. Cynics may argue that such an outcome can never come to pass.  But there is no other way for this madness to end -- whether one year from now or ten.  And it points to the fact that its time for a broader negotiation in the region in which major powers address their differences directly, honestly, and peacefully across the table from one another, rather than through gun-wielding proxies.  I can promise you America will remain engaged in the region, and we are prepared to engage in that effort. My fourth and final point is a simple one:  The countries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on the extraordinary potential of their people -- especially the youth. And here Id like to speak directly to young people across the Muslim world.  You come from a great tradition that stands for education, not ignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of life, not murder.  Those who call you away from this path are betraying this tradition, not defending it. You have demonstrated that when young people have the tools to succeed -- good schools, education in math and science, an economy that nurtures creativity and entrepreneurship -- then societies will flourish.  So America will partner with those that promote that vision. Where women are full participants in a countrys politics or economy, societies are more likely to succeed.  And thats why we support the participation of women in parliaments and peace processes, schools and the economy. If young people live in places where the only option is between the dictates of a state, or the lure of an extremist underground, then no counterterrorism strategy can succeed.  But where a genuine civil society is allowed to flourish -- where people can express their views, and organize peacefully for a better life -- then you dramatically expand the alternatives to terror. And such positive change need not come at the expense of tradition and faith.  We see this in Iraq, where a young man started a library for his peers.  We link Iraqs heritage to their hearts, he said, and give them a reason to stay.  We see it in Tunisia, where secular and Islamist parties worked together through a political process to produce a new constitution.  We see it in Senegal, where civil society thrives alongside a strong democratic government.  We see it in Malaysia, where vibrant entrepreneurship is propelling a former colony into the ranks of advanced economies.  And we see it in Indonesia, where what began as a violent transition has evolved into a genuine democracy.   Now, ultimately, the task of rejecting sectarianism and rejecting extremism is a generational task -- and a task for the people of the Middle East themselves.   No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds.  But America will be a respectful and constructive partner.  We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens, nor act as an occupying power.  We will take action against threats to our security and our allies, while building an architecture of counterterrorism cooperation.  We will increase efforts to lift up those who counter extremist ideologies and who seek to resolve sectarian conflict.  And we will expand our programs to support entrepreneurship and civil society, education and youth -- because, ultimately, these investments are the best antidote to violence. We recognize as well that leadership will be necessary to address the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.  As bleak as the landscape appears, America will not give up on the pursuit of peace.  Understand, the situation in Iraq and Syria and Libya should cure anybody of the illusion that the Arab-Israeli conflict is the main source of problems in the region.  For far too long, that's been used as an excuse to distract people from problems at home.  The violence engulfing the region today has made too many Israelis ready to abandon the hard work of peace.  And that's something worthy of reflection within Israel. Because lets be clear:  The status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not sustainable.  We cannot afford to turn away from this effort -- not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis, or the lives of so many Palestinian children are taken from us in Gaza. So long as I am President, we will stand up for the principle that Israelis, Palestinians, the region and the world will be more just and more safe with two states living side by side, in peace and security. So this is what America is prepared to do:  Taking action against immediate threats, while pursuing a world in which the need for such action is diminished.  The United States will never shy away from defending our interests, but we will also not shy away from the promise of this institution and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- the notion that peace is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of a better life.  I realize that Americas critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals; that America has plenty of problems within its own borders.  This is true.  In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri -- where a young man was killed, and a community was divided.  So, yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.  And like every country, we continually wrestle with how to reconcile the vast changes wrought by globalization and greater diversity with the traditions that we hold dear. But we welcome the scrutiny of the world -- because what you see in America is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems, to make our union more perfect, to bridge the divides that existed at the founding of this nation.  America is not the same as it was 100 years ago, or 50 years ago, or even a decade ago.  Because we fight for our ideals, and we are willing to criticize ourselves when we fall short.  Because we hold our leaders accountable, and insist on a free press and independent judiciary.  Because we address our differences in the open space of democracy -- with respect for the rule of law; with a place for people of every race and every religion; and with an unyielding belief in the ability of individual men and women to change their communities and their circumstances and their countries for the better. After nearly six years as President, I believe that this promise can help light the world.  Because I have seen a longing for positive change -- for peace and for freedom and for opportunity and for the end to bigotry -- in the eyes of young people who Ive met around the globe. They remind me that no matter who you are, or where you come from, or what you look like, or what God you pray to, or who you love, there is something fundamental that we all share.  Eleanor Roosevelt, a champion of the UN and Americas role in it, once asked, Where, after all, do universal human rights begin?", "filename": "24September2014UnitedNations69thSessionGeneralAssemblySpeech.txt"}, {"question": "How can a nation that relies on its miners not do everything in its power to protect them? How can we let anyone in this country put their lives at risk by simply showing up to work; by simply pursuing the American Dream?", "filename": "25 April 2010  Eulogy for Upper Big Branch Miners.txt"}, {"question": "And welcome to the fourth quarter of my presidency.  It's true -- that was Michelle cheering.  The fact is, I feel more loose and relaxed than ever.  Those Joe Biden shoulder massages, they're like magic.  You should try one.  Oh, you have. I am determined to make the most of every moment I have left.  After the midterm elections, my advisors asked me, \"Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?\"  And I said, \"Well, I have something that rhymes with bucket list.'\" Take executive action on immigration?  Bucket. New climate regulations?  Bucket.  It's the right thing to do. And my new attitude is paying off.  Look at my Cuba policy.  The Castro brothers are here tonight. Welcome to America, amigos!  Que pasa?  What?  It's the Castros from Texas? Oh.  Hi Joaquin.  Hi Julian. Anyway, being President is never easy. I still have to fix a broken immigration system, issue veto threats, negotiate with Iran -- all while finding time to pray five times a day. Which is strenuous. And it is no wonder that people keep pointing out how the presidency has aged me.  I look so old, John Boehner has already invited Netanyahu to speak at my funeral.  Meanwhile, Michelle hasn't aged a day. I ask her what her secret is, she just says \"fresh fruits and vegetables.\"  It's aggravating. The fact is, though, at this point, my legacy is finally beginning to take shape.  The economy is getting better.  Nine in ten Americans now have health coverage. Today, thanks to Obamacare, you no longer have to worry about losing your insurance if you lose your job.  You're welcome, Senate Democrats. Now, look, it is true I have not managed to make everybody happy.  Six years into my presidency, some people still say I'm arrogant and aloof, condescending.  Some people are so dumb. No wonder I don't meet with them. And that's not all people say about me.  A few weeks ago, Dick Cheney says he thinks I'm the worst President of his lifetime.  Which is interesting, because I think Dick Cheney is the worst President of my lifetime. It's quite a coincidence. I mean, everybody has got something to say these days.  Mike Huckabee recently said people shouldn't join our military until a true conservative is elected President.  Think about that.  It was so outrageous, 47 Ayatollahs wrote us a letter trying to explain to Huckabee how our system works. It gets worse.  Just this week, Michele Bachmann actually predicted that I would bring about the biblical end of days. Now that's a legacy! That's big.  I mean, Lincoln, Washington -- they didn't do that. But I just have to put this stuff aside, I've got to stay focused on my job, because for many Americans, this is still a time of deep uncertainty.  For example, I have one friend -- just a few weeks ago, she was making millions of dollars a year.  And she's now living out of a van in Iowa. Meanwhile, back here in our nation's capital, we're always dealing with new challenges.  I'm happy to report that the Secret Service, thanks to some excellent reporting by White House correspondents, they're really focusing on some of the issues that have come up.  And they finally figured out a full-proof way to keep people off my lawn. It works.  And it's not just fence-jumpers.  As some of you know, a few months ago, a drone crash-landed out back.  That was pretty serious, but don't worry, we've installed a new, state-of-the-art security system. You know what, let me set the record straight.  I tease Joe sometimes, but he has been at my side for seven years now.  I love that man. He's not just a great Vice President, he is a great friend.  We've gotten so close, in some places in Indiana, they won't serve us pizza anymore. I want to thank our host for the evening, a Chicago girl, the incredibly talented Cecily Strong. On \"Saturday Night Live,\" Cecily impersonates CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin.  Which is surprising, because usually the only people impersonating journalists on CNN are journalists on CNN. ABC is here with some of the stars from their big new comedy, \"Black-ish. \"It's a great show, but I have to give ABC fair warning -- being \"Black-ish\" only makes you popular for so long.  Trust me. There's a shelf life to that thing. As always, the reporters here had a lot to cover over the last year.  Here on the East Coast, one big story was the brutal winter.  The polar vortex caused so many record lows, they renamed it \"MSNBC.\" But of course, let's face it, there is one issue on every reporter's mind and that is 2016.  Already, we've seen some missteps.  It turns out Jeb Bush identified himself as \"Hispanic\" back in 2009.  Which you know what, look, I understand.  It's an innocent mistake.  Reminds me of when I identified myself as \"American\" back in 1961. Ted Cruz said that denying the existence of climate change made him like Galileo. Now that's not really an apt comparison.  Galileo believed the Earth revolves around the sun.  Ted Cruz believes the Earth revolves around Ted Cruz. And just as an aside, I want to point out, when a guy who has his face on a \"Hope\" poster calls you self-centered, you know you've got a problem. The narcissism index is creeping up a little too high. Meanwhile, Rick Santorum announced that he would not attend the same-sex wedding of a friend or a loved one.  To which gays and lesbians across the country responded, that's not going to be a problem. Don't sweat that one. And Donald Trump is here.  Still.  Anyway. It's amazing how time flies.  Soon, the first presidential contest will take place.  And I for one cannot wait to see who the Koch brothers pick. It's exciting.  Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker.  Who will finally get that red rose? The winner gets a billion-dollar war chest.  The runner up gets to be the bachelor on the next season of \"The Bachelor. \"I mean, seriously, a billion dollars.  From just two guys.  Is it just me, or does that feel a little excessive? I mean, it's almost insulting to the candidates.  The Koch brothers think they need to spend a billion dollars to get folks to like one of these people. It's got to hurt their feelings a little bit. And, look, I know I've raised a lot of money too.  But in all fairness, my middle name is \"Hussein. \"What's their excuse?  The trail hasn't been easy for my fellow Democrats either.  As we all know, Hillary's private emails got her in trouble. Frankly, I thought it was going to be her private Instagram account that was going to cause her bigger problems.  Hillary kicked things off by going completely unrecognized at a Chipotle.  Not to be outdone, Martin O'Malley kicked things off by going completely unrecognized at a Martin O'Malley campaign event.  And Bernie Sanders might run.  I like Bernie.  Bernie is an interesting guy.  Apparently some folks really want to see a pot-smoking socialist in the White House. We could get a third Obama term after all. It could happen. Anyway, as always, I want to close on a more serious note.  I often joke about tensions between me and the press, but honestly, what they say doesn't bother me.  I understand we've got an adversarial system.  I'm a mellow sort of guy.  And that's why I invited Luther, my anger translator, to join me here tonight.    [Enter Luther] Luther:  Hold on to your lily-white butts. President Obama:  In our fast-changing world, traditions like the White House Correspondents' Dinner are important.  Luther:  I mean, really, what is this dinner? And why am I required to come to it? Jeb Bush, do you really want to do this? President Obama:  Because despite our differences, we count on the press to shed light on the most important issues of the day.  Luther:  And we can count on Fox News to terrify old white people with some nonsense!\" Sharia law is coming to Cleveland.  Run for the damn hills! \"Y'all, it's ridiculous. President Obama:  We won't always see eye to eye. Luther: Oh, and CNN, thank you so much for the wall-to-wall Ebola coverage.  For two whole weeks, we were one step away from the Walking Dead. And then you all got up and just moved on to the next day.  That was awesome.  Oh, and by the way, just if you haven't noticed, you don't have Ebola! President Obama:  But I still deeply appreciate the work that you do. Luther:  Ya'll remember when I had that big, old hole in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico and then I plugged it?  Remember that?  Which \"Obama's Katrina\" was that one?  Was that 19?  Or was it 20?  Because I can't remember. President Obama:  Protecting our democracy is more important than ever.  For example, the Supreme Court ruled that the donor who gave Ted Cruz 6 million dollars was just exercising free speech. Luther:  Yeah, that's the kind of speech like this, \"I just wasted six million dollars.\"  President Obama:  And it's not just Republicans.  Hillary will have to rage [raise] huge sums of money, too. Luther:  Oh, yes.  She's going to get that money.  She's going to get all the money.  Khaleesi is coming to Westeros. So watch out! President Obama:  The nonstop focus on billionaire donors creates real problems for our democracy. Luther:  And that's why we're running for a third term! President Obama:  No, we're not. Luther: We're not? President Obama:  No. Luther:  Who the hell said that? President Obama:  But we do need to stay focused on some big challenges, like climate change. Luther:  Hey, listen, ya'll, if you haven't noticed, California is bone dry. It looks like a trailer for the new \"Mad Max\" movie up in there. Ya'll think that Bradley Cooper came here because he wants to talk to Chuck Todd? He needed a glass of water.  Come on!  President Obama:  The science is clear.  Nine of the ten hottest years ever came in the last decade. Luther:  Now, I'm not a scientist, but I do know how to count to 10. President Obama:  Rising seas, more violent storms. Luther:  We've got mosquitoes. Sweaty people on the train, stinking it up.  It's just nasty. President Obama:  I mean, look at what's happening right now.  Every serious scientist says we need to act.  The Pentagon says it's a national security risk.  Miami floods on a sunny day, and instead of doing anything about it, we've got elected officials throwing snowballs in the Senate! Luther:  Okay, Mr. President.  Okay, I think they've got it, bro.  President Obama:  It is crazy!  What about our kids?  What kind of stupid, shortsighted, irresponsible bull --  Luther:  Wow!  Hey!  President Obama:  What?", "filename": "25April2015WhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinnerSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "For the last decade, weve spent more money than we take in.  In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus.  But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nations credit card. As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.  To make matters worse, the recession meant that there was less money coming in, and it required us to spend even more - on tax cuts for middle-class families to spur the economy; on unemployment insurance; on aid to states so we could prevent more teachers and firefighters and police officers from being laid off.  These emergency steps also added to the deficit. Now, every family knows that a little credit card debt is manageable.  But if we stay on the current path, our growing debt could cost us jobs and do serious damage to the economy.  More of our tax dollars will go toward paying off the interest on our loans.  Businesses will be less likely to open up shop and hire workers in a country that cant balance its books.  Interest rates could climb for everyone who borrows money - the homeowner with a mortgage, the student with a college loan, the corner store that wants to expand.  And we wont have enough money to make job-creating investments in things like education and infrastructure, or pay for vital programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Because neither party is blameless for the decisions that led to this problem, both parties have a responsibility to solve it.  And over the last several months, thats what weve been trying to do.  I wont bore you with the details of every plan or proposal, but basically, the debate has centered around two different approaches. The first approach says, lets live within our means by making serious, historic cuts in government spending.  Lets cut domestic spending to the lowest level its been since Dwight Eisenhower was President.  Lets cut defense spending at the Pentagon by hundreds of billions of dollars.  Lets cut out waste and fraud in health care programs like Medicare -- and at the same time, lets make modest adjustments so that Medicare is still there for future generations.  Finally, lets ask the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to give up some of their breaks in the tax code and special deductions. This balanced approach asks everyone to give a little without requiring anyone to sacrifice too much.  It would reduce the deficit by around $4 trillion and put us on a path to pay down our debt.  And the cuts wouldnt happen so abruptly that theyd be a drag on our economy, or prevent us from helping small businesses and middle-class families get back on their feet right now. This approach is also bipartisan.  While many in my own party arent happy with the painful cuts it makes, enough will be willing to accept them if the burden is fairly shared.  While Republicans might like to see deeper cuts and no revenue at all, there are many in the Senate who have said, Yes, Im willing to put politics aside and consider this approach because I care about solving the problem.  And to his credit, this is the kind of approach the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, was working on with me over the last several weeks. The only reason this balanced approach isnt on its way to becoming law right now is because a significant number of Republicans in Congress are insisting on a different approach -- a cuts-only approach - an approach that doesnt ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute anything at all.  And because nothing is asked of those at the top of the income scale, such an approach would close the deficit only with more severe cuts to programs we all care about - cuts that place a greater burden on working families. So the debate right now isnt about whether we need to make tough choices.  Democrats and Republicans agree on the amount of deficit reduction we need.  The debate is about how it should be done.  Most Americans, regardless of political party, dont understand how we can ask a senior citizen to pay more for her Medicare before we ask a corporate jet owner or the oil companies to give up tax breaks that other companies dont get.  How can we ask a student to pay more for college before we ask hedge fund managers to stop paying taxes at a lower rate than their secretaries?  How can we slash funding for education and clean energy before we ask people like me to give up tax breaks we dont need and didnt ask for?   Thats not right.  Its not fair.  We all want a government that lives within its means, but there are still things we need to pay for as a country - things like new roads and bridges; weather satellites and food inspection; services to veterans and medical research.  And keep in mind that under a balanced approach, the 98 percent of Americans who make under $250,000 would see no tax increases at all.  None.  In fact, I want to extend the payroll tax cut for working families.  What were talking about under a balanced approach is asking Americans whose incomes have gone up the most over the last decade - millionaires and billionaires - to share in the sacrifice everyone else has to make.  And I think these patriotic Americans are willing to pitch in.  In fact, over the last few decades, theyve pitched in every time we passed a bipartisan deal to reduce the deficit.  The first time a deal was passed, a predecessor of mine made the case for a balanced approach by saying this: Would you rather reduce deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not now paying their fair share, or would you rather accept larger budget deficits, higher interest rates, and higher unemployment?  And I think I know your answer. Those words were spoken by Ronald Reagan.  But today, many Republicans in the House refuse to consider this kind of balanced approach - an approach that was pursued not only by President Reagan, but by the first President Bush, by President Clinton, by myself, and by many Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate.  So were left with a stalemate.  Now, what makes todays stalemate so dangerous is that it has been tied to something known as the debt ceiling - a term that most people outside of Washington have probably never heard of before.  Understand - raising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money.  It simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up.  In the past, raising the debt ceiling was routine.  Since the 1950s, Congress has always passed it, and every President has signed it.  President Reagan did it 18 times.  George W. Bush did it seven times.  And we have to do it by next Tuesday, August 2nd, or else we wont be able to pay all of our bills.   Unfortunately, for the past several weeks, Republican House members have essentially said that the only way theyll vote to prevent Americas first-ever default is if the rest of us agree to their deep, spending cuts-only approach.    If that happens, and we default, we would not have enough money to pay all of our bills - bills that include monthly Social Security checks, veterans benefits, and the government contracts weve signed with thousands of businesses.  For the first time in history, our countrys AAA credit rating would be downgraded, leaving investors around the world to wonder whether the United States is still a good bet.  Interest rates would skyrocket on credit cards, on mortgages and on car loans, which amounts to a huge tax hike on the American people.  We would risk sparking a deep economic crisis - this one caused almost entirely by Washington. So defaulting on our obligations is a reckless and irresponsible outcome to this debate.  And Republican leaders say that they agree we must avoid default.  But the new approach that Speaker Boehner unveiled today, which would temporarily extend the debt ceiling in exchange for spending cuts, would force us to once again face the threat of default just six months from now.  In other words, it doesnt solve the problem.   First of all, a six-month extension of the debt ceiling might not be enough to avoid a credit downgrade and the higher interest rates that all Americans would have to pay as a result.  We know what we have to do to reduce our deficits; theres no point in putting the economy at risk by kicking the can further down the road.     But theres an even greater danger to this approach.  Based on what weve seen these past few weeks, we know what to expect six months from now.  The House of Representatives will once again refuse to prevent default unless the rest of us accept their cuts-only approach.  Again, they will refuse to ask the wealthiest Americans to give up their tax cuts or deductions.  Again, they will demand harsh cuts to programs like Medicare.  And once again, the economy will be held captive unless they get their way.  This is no way to run the greatest country on Earth.  Its a dangerous game that weve never played before, and we cant afford to play it now.  Not when the jobs and livelihoods of so many families are at stake.  We cant allow the American people to become collateral damage to Washingtons political warfare.  Congress now has one week left to act, and there are still paths forward.  The Senate has introduced a plan to avoid default, which makes a down payment on deficit reduction and ensures that we dont have to go through this again in six months.  I think thats a much better approach, although serious deficit reduction would still require us to tackle the tough challenges of entitlement and tax reform.  Either way, Ive told leaders of both parties that they must come up with a fair compromise in the next few days that can pass both houses of Congress - and a compromise that I can sign.  Im confident we can reach this compromise.  Despite our disagreements, Republican leaders and I have found common ground before.  And I believe that enough members of both parties will ultimately put politics aside and help us make progress. Now, I realize that a lot of the new members of Congress and I dont see eye-to-eye on many issues.  But we were each elected by some of the same Americans for some of the same reasons.  Yes, many want government to start living within its means.  And many are fed up with a system in which the deck seems stacked against middle-class Americans in favor of the wealthiest few.  But do you know what people are fed up with most of all?", "filename": "25July2011SpeechtotheNationontheBudgetandDebtCeiling.txt"}, {"question": "My Lord Chancellor, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Prime Minister, my lords, and members of the House of Commons: I have known few greater honors than the opportunity to address the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster Hall. I am told that the last three speakers here have been the Pope, Her Majesty the Queen, and Nelson Mandela -- which is either a very high bar or the beginning of a very funny joke. I come here today to reaffirm one of the oldest, one of the strongest alliances the world has ever known. Its long been said that the United States and the United Kingdom share a special relationship. And since we also share an especially active press corps, that relationship is often analyzed and overanalyzed for the slightest hint of stress or strain. Of course, all relationships have their ups and downs. Admittedly, ours got off on the wrong foot with a small scrape about tea and taxes. There may also have been some hurt feelings when the White House was set on fire during the War of 1812. But fortunately, its been smooth sailing ever since. The reason for this close friendship doesnt just have to do with our shared history, our shared heritage; our ties of language and culture; or even the strong partnership between our governments. Our relationship is special because of the values and beliefs that have united our people through the ages. Centuries ago, when kings, emperors, and warlords reigned over much of the world, it was the English who first spelled out the rights and liberties of man in the Magna Carta. It was here, in this very hall, where the rule of law first developed, courts were established, disputes were settled, and citizens came to petition their leaders. Over time, the people of this nation waged a long and sometimes bloody struggle to expand and secure their freedom from the crown. Propelled by the ideals of the Enlightenment, they would ultimately forge an English Bill of Rights, and invest the power to govern in an elected parliament thats gathered here today. What began on this island would inspire millions throughout the continent of Europe and across the world. But perhaps no one drew greater inspiration from these notions of freedom than your rabble-rousing colonists on the other side of the Atlantic. As Winston Churchill said, the Magna Carta, the Bill of Rights, Habeas Corpus, trial by jury, and English common law find their most famous expression in the American Declaration of Independence. For both of our nations, living up to the ideals enshrined in these founding documents has sometimes been difficult, has always been a work in progress. The path has never been perfect. But through the struggles of slaves and immigrants, women and ethnic minorities, former colonies and persecuted religions, we have learned better than most that the longing for freedom and human dignity is not English or American or Western -- it is universal, and it beats in every heart. Perhaps thats why there are few nations that stand firmer, speak louder, and fight harder to defend democratic values around the world than the United States and the United Kingdom. We are the allies who landed at Omaha and Gold, who sacrificed side by side to free a continent from the march of tyranny, and help prosperity flourish from the ruins of war. And with the founding of NATO -- a British idea -- we joined a transatlantic alliance that has ensured our security for over half a century. Together with our allies, we forged a lasting peace from a cold war. When the Iron Curtain lifted, we expanded our alliance to include the nations of Central and Eastern Europe, and built new bridges to Russia and the former states of the Soviet Union. And when there was strife in the Balkans, we worked together to keep the peace. Today, after a difficult decade that began with war and ended in recession, our nations have arrived at a pivotal moment once more. A global economy that once stood on the brink of depression is now stable and recovering. After years of conflict, the United States has removed 100,000 troops from Iraq, the United Kingdom has removed its forces, and our combat mission there has ended. In Afghanistan, weve broken the Talibans momentum and will soon begin a transition to Afghan lead. And nearly 10 years after 9/11, we have disrupted terrorist networks and dealt al Qaeda a huge blow by killing its leader -- Osama bin Laden. Together, we have met great challenges. But as we enter this new chapter in our shared history, profound challenges stretch before us. In a world where the prosperity of all nations is now inextricably linked, a new era of cooperation is required to ensure the growth and stability of the global economy. As new threats spread across borders and oceans, we must dismantle terrorist networks and stop the spread of nuclear weapons, confront climate change and combat famine and disease. And as a revolution races through the streets of the Middle East and North Africa, the entire world has a stake in the aspirations of a generation that longs to determine its own destiny. These challenges come at a time when the international order has already been reshaped for a new century. Countries like China, India, and Brazil are growing by leaps and bounds. We should welcome this development, for it has lifted hundreds of millions from poverty around the globe, and created new markets and opportunities for our own nations. And yet, as this rapid change has taken place, its become fashionable in some quarters to question whether the rise of these nations will accompany the decline of American and European influence around the world. Perhaps, the argument goes, these nations represent the future, and the time for our leadership has passed. That argument is wrong. The time for our leadership is now. It was the United States and the United Kingdom and our democratic allies that shaped a world in which new nations could emerge and individuals could thrive. And even as more nations take on the responsibilities of global leadership, our alliance will remain indispensable to the goal of a century that is more peaceful, more prosperous and more just. At a time when threats and challenges require nations to work in concert with one another, we remain the greatest catalysts for global action. In an era defined by the rapid flow of commerce and information, it is our free market tradition, our openness, fortified by our commitment to basic security for our citizens, that offers the best chance of prosperity that is both strong and shared. As millions are still denied their basic human rights because of who they are, or what they believe, or the kind of government that they live under, we are the nations most willing to stand up for the values of tolerance and self-determination that lead to peace and dignity. Now, this doesnt mean we can afford to stand still. The nature of our leadership will need to change with the times. As I said the first time I came to London as President, for the G20 summit, the days are gone when Roosevelt and Churchill could sit in a room and solve the worlds problems over a glass of brandy -- although Im sure that Prime Minister Cameron would agree that some days we could both use a stiff drink. In this century, our joint leadership will require building new partnerships, adapting to new circumstances, and remaking ourselves to meet the demands of a new era. That begins with our economic leadership. Adam Smiths central insight remains true today: There is no greater generator of wealth and innovation than a system of free enterprise that unleashes the full potential of individual men and women. Thats what led to the Industrial Revolution that began in the factories of Manchester. That is what led to the dawn of the Information Age that arose from the office parks of Silicon Valley. Thats why countries like China, India and Brazil are growing so rapidly -- because in fits and starts, they are moving toward market-based principles that the United States and the United Kingdom have always embraced. In other words, we live in a global economy that is largely of our own making. And today, the competition for the best jobs and industries favors countries that are free-thinking and forward-looking; countries with the most creative and innovative and entrepreneurial citizens. That gives nations like the United States and the United Kingdom an inherent advantage. For from Newton and Darwin to Edison and Einstein, from Alan Turing to Steve Jobs, we have led the world in our commitment to science and cutting-edge research, the discovery of new medicines and technologies. We educate our citizens and train our workers in the best colleges and universities on Earth. But to maintain this advantage in a world thats more competitive than ever, we will have to redouble our investments in science and engineering, and renew our national commitments to educating our workforces. Weve also been reminded in the last few years that markets can sometimes fail. In the last century, both our nations put in place regulatory frameworks to deal with such market failures -- safeguards to protect the banking system after the Great Depression, for example; regulations that were established to prevent the pollution of our air and water during the 1970s. But in todays economy, such threats of market failure can no longer be contained within the borders of any one country. Market failures can go global, and go viral, and demand international responses. A financial crisis that began on Wall Street infected nearly every continent, which is why we must keep working through forums like the G20 to put in place global rules of the road to prevent future excesses and abuse. No country can hide from the dangers of carbon pollution, which is why we must build on what was achieved at Copenhagen and Cancun to leave our children a planet that is safer and cleaner. Moreover, even when the free market works as it should, both our countries recognize that no matter how responsibly we live in our lives, hard times or bad luck, a crippling illness or a layoff may strike any one of us. And so part of our common tradition has expressed itself in a conviction that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security -- health care if you get sick, unemployment insurance if you lose your job, a dignified retirement after a lifetime of hard work. That commitment to our citizens has also been the reason for our leadership in the world. And now, having come through a terrible recession, our challenge is to meet these obligations while ensuring that were not consuming -- and hence consumed with -- a level of debt that could sap the strength and vitality of our economies. And that will require difficult choices and it will require different paths for both of our countries. But we have faced such challenges before, and have always been able to balance the need for fiscal responsibility with the responsibilities we have to one another. And I believe we can do this again. As we do, the successes and failures of our own past can serve as an example for emerging economies -- that its possible to grow without polluting; that lasting prosperity comes not from what a nation consumes, but from what it produces, and from the investments it makes in its people and its infrastructure. And just as we must lead on behalf of the prosperity of our citizens, so we must safeguard their security. Our two nations know what it is to confront evil in the world.  Hitlers armies would not have stopped their killing had we not fought them on the beaches and on the landing grounds, in the fields and on the streets. We must never forget that there was nothing inevitable about our victory in that terrible war. It was won through the courage and character of our people. Precisely because we are willing to bear its burden, we know well the cost of war.  And that is why we built an alliance that was strong enough to defend this continent while deterring our enemies. At its core, NATO is rooted in the simple concept of Article Five: that no NATO nation will have to fend on its own; that allies will stand by one another, always. And for six decades, NATO has been the most successful alliance in human history. Today, we confront a different enemy. Terrorists have taken the lives of our citizens in New York and in London. And while al Qaeda seeks a religious war with the West, we must remember that they have killed thousands of Muslims -- men, women and children -- around the globe. Our nations are not and will never be at war with Islam.  Our fight is focused on defeating al Qaeda and its extremist allies. In that effort, we will not relent, as Osama bin Laden and his followers have learned. And as we fight an enemy that respects no law of war, we will continue to hold ourselves to a higher standard -- by living up to the values, the rule of law and due process that we so ardently defend. For almost a decade, Afghanistan has been a central front of these efforts.  Throughout those years, you, the British people, have been a stalwart ally, along with so many others who fight by our side. Together, let us pay tribute to all of our men and women who have served and sacrificed over the last several years -- for they are part of an unbroken line of heroes who have borne the heaviest burden for the freedoms that we enjoy. Because of them, we have broken the Talibans momentum. Because of them, we have built the capacity of Afghan security forces. And because of them, we are now preparing to turn a corner in Afghanistan by transitioning to Afghan lead. And during this transition, we will pursue a lasting peace with those who break free of al Qaeda and respect the Afghan constitution and lay down arms. And we will ensure that Afghanistan is never a safe haven for terror, but is instead a country that is strong, sovereign, and able to stand on its own two feet. Indeed, our efforts in this young century have led us to a new concept for NATO that will give us the capabilities needed to meet new threats -- threats like terrorism and piracy, cyber attacks and ballistic missiles. But a revitalized NATO will continue to hew to that original vision of its founders, allowing us to rally collective action for the defense of our people, while building upon the broader belief of Roosevelt and Churchill that all nations have both rights and responsibilities, and all nations share a common interest in an international architecture that maintains the peace. We also share a common interest in stopping the spread of nuclear weapons. Across the globe, nations are locking down nuclear materials so they never fall into the wrong hands -- because of our leadership. From North Korea to Iran, weve sent a message that those who flaunt their obligations will face consequences -- which is why America and the European Union just recently strengthened our sanctions on Iran, in large part because of the leadership of the United Kingdom and the United States. And while we hold others to account, we will meet our own obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and strive for a world without nuclear weapons. We share a common interest in resolving conflicts that prolong human suffering and threaten to tear whole regions asunder. In Sudan, after years of war and thousands of deaths, we call on both North and South to pull back from the brink of violence and choose the path of peace. And in the Middle East, we stand united in our support for a secure Israel and a sovereign Palestine. And we share a common interest in development that advances dignity and security. To succeed, we must cast aside the impulse to look at impoverished parts of the globe as a place for charity. Instead, we should empower the same forces that have allowed our own people to thrive: We should help the hungry to feed themselves, the doctors who care for the sick. We should support countries that confront corruption, and allow their people to innovate. And we should advance the truth that nations prosper when they allow women and girls to reach their full potential. We do these things because we believe not simply in the rights of nations; we believe in the rights of citizens. That is the beacon that guided us through our fight against fascism and our twilight struggle against communism. And today, that idea is being put to the test in the Middle East and North Africa. In country after country, people are mobilizing to free themselves from the grip of an iron fist. And while these movements for change are just six months old, we have seen them play out before -- from Eastern Europe to the Americas, from South Africa to Southeast Asia. History tells us that democracy is not easy. It will be years before these revolutions reach their conclusion, and there will be difficult days along the way. Power rarely gives up without a fight -- particularly in places where there are divisions of tribe and divisions of sect. We also know that populism can take dangerous turns -- from the extremism of those who would use democracy to deny minority rights, to the nationalism that left so many scars on this continent in the 20th century. But make no mistake: What we saw, what we are seeing in Tehran, in Tunis, in Tahrir Square, is a longing for the same freedoms that we take for granted here at home. It was a rejection of the notion that people in certain parts of the world dont want to be free, or need to have democracy imposed upon them. It was a rebuke to the worldview of al Qaeda, which smothers the rights of individuals, and would thereby subject them to perpetual poverty and violence. Let there be no doubt: The United States and United Kingdom stand squarely on the side of those who long to be free. And now, we must show that we will back up those words with deeds. That means investing in the future of those nations that transition to democracy, starting with Tunisia and Egypt -- by deepening ties of trade and commerce; by helping them demonstrate that freedom brings prosperity. And that means standing up for universal rights -- by sanctioning those who pursue repression, strengthening civil society, supporting the rights of minorities. We do this knowing that the West must overcome suspicion and mistrust among many in the Middle East and North Africa -- a mistrust that is rooted in a difficult past. For years, weve faced charges of hypocrisy from those who do not enjoy the freedoms that they hear us espouse. And so to them, we must squarely acknowledge that, yes, we have enduring interests in the region -- to fight terror, sometimes with partners who may not be perfect; to protect against disruptions of the worlds energy supply. But we must also insist that we reject as false the choice between our interests and our ideals; between stability and democracy. For our idealism is rooted in the realities of history -- that repression offers only the false promise of stability, that societies are more successful when their citizens are free, and that democracies are the closest allies we have. It is that truth that guides our action in Libya. It would have been easy at the outset of the crackdown in Libya to say that none of this was our business -- that a nations sovereignty is more important than the slaughter of civilians within its borders. That argument carries weight with some. But we are different. We embrace a broader responsibility. And while we cannot stop every injustice, there are circumstances that cut through our caution -- when a leader is threatening to massacre his people, and the international community is calling for action. Thats why we stopped a massacre in Libya.  And we will not relent until the people of Libya are protected and the shadow of tyranny is lifted. We will proceed with humility, and the knowledge that we cannot dictate every outcome abroad. Ultimately, freedom must be won by the people themselves, not imposed from without. But we can and must stand with those who so struggle.  Because we have always believed that the future of our children and grandchildren will be better if other peoples children and grandchildren are more prosperous and more free -- from the beaches of Normandy to the Balkans to Benghazi. That is our interests and our ideals. And if we fail to meet that responsibility, who would take our place, and what kind of world would we pass on?", "filename": "25May2011SpeechtotheBritishParliament.txt"}, {"question": "And our visit to Hiroshima will honor all those who were lost in World War II and reaffirm our shared vision of a world without nuclear weapons, as well as highlight the extraordinary alliance that we have been able to forge over these many decades. Question: [As interpreted.]  I would like to ask a question to Prime Minister Abe with regard to the most recent, very tragic case in Okinawa. I understand that more than 20 years have already passed since the rape incident, which involved U.S. Marine Corps officers back in 1995.  But even so, we do not see the decreasing number of crimes involving the U.S. people.  And it is quite a regrettable trend.  And whenever Japan faces each of the case or accident, I understand that the Japanese government has been requesting the U.S. side to take measures to prevent the recurrence of such measures.  And also, you have been dealing with the situation through the improvement of the implementation of the SOFA instead of having amendment to the SOFA itself.  And I am aware of the fact that your judicial systems are quite different between Japan and the United States. So my question to the Prime Minister is that whether or not you have requested to the President that we should have the revision or amendment to the SOFA.  And also, in order for you to see the progress in the base-related issues, I understand that the key is to regain the confidence among the people in Okinawa, as well as ensuring safety and security among the people in Okinawa.  So what specific measures are you planning to implement as you move forward?", "filename": "25May2016PressConferencewithPrimeMinisterShinzoAbe.txt"}, {"question": "My intention is to thoroughly implement measures to prevent crimes, and ensure safety and peace of mind among the people in Okinawa.  So I already gave the instruction to my Chief Cabinet Secretary to consider such measures in a timely manner.

Question:  Thank you very much, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. Mr. President, on this trip you are confronting old warzones and the use of American military might in them.  This week, you also crossed into sovereign Pakistani territory, where you did not have permission to operate, in order to kill the leader of the Taliban.  After expanding the use of the drone program as you have, are you worried at all about handing it over to the next President?  Could I also ask what your response is to the Chinese warnings this week that the U.S. and its partners in this region may be creating a tinderbox that would lead to regional conflict? And, Mr. Prime Minister, if you would also reflect on that, I would appreciate it.  Could you also tell us a little bit about what you think the Presidents visit to Hiroshima means to the Japanese people?  And will you also consider a trip to Pearl Harbor, sir?", "filename": "25May2016PressConferencewithPrimeMinisterShinzoAbe.txt"}, {"question": "President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman:  I would like to begin today by telling you about an American named Chris Stevens. Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician.  As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps, and taught English in Morocco.  And he came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East. He would carry that commitment throughout his life.  As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from Saudi Arabia to Libya.  He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked -- tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic, listening with a broad smile.  Chris went to Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship.  As Americas representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for the future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. And after the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans held elections, and built new institutions, and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship. Chris Stevens loved his work.  He took pride in the country he served, and he saw dignity in the people that he met.  And two weeks ago, he traveled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital.  Thats when Americas compound came under attack.  Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city that he helped to save. He was 52 years old.  I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America.  Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents.  He acted with humility, but he also stood up for a set of principles -- a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity.  The attacks on the civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America.  We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and from the Libyan people.  There should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice.  And I also appreciate that in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region -- including Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen -- have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities, and called for calm.  And so have religious authorities around the globe. But understand, the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America.  They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded -- the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens. If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an embassy, or to put out statements of regret and wait for the outrage to pass.  If we are serious about these ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of the crisis -- because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart and the hopes that we hold in common. Today, we must reaffirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens -- and not by his killers.  Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations. It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country, and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring.  And since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation thats taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change. We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspiration of men and women who took to the streets. We insisted on change in Egypt, because our support for democracy ultimately put us on the side of the people.  We supported a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were no longer being served by a corrupt status quo. We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the United Nations Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents, and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant. And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Assad must come to an end so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a new dawn can begin. We have taken these positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture.  These are not simply American values or Western values -- they are universal values.  And even as there will be huge challenges to come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that ultimately government of the people, by the people, and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world. So let us remember that this is a season of progress.  For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive, and fair.  This democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab world.  Over the past year, weve seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in Somalia.  In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society, a courageous dissident has been elected to parliament, and people look forward to further reform.  Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity, and the right to determine their future. And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot.  Nelson Mandela once said:  \"To be free is not merely to cast off ones chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.\" True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe, and that businesses can be opened without paying a bribe.  It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear, and on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all people. In other words, true democracy -- real freedom -- is hard work.  Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissidents.  In hard economic times, countries must be tempted -- may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform. Moreover, there will always be those that reject human progress -- dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend on the status quo, and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division.  From Northern Ireland to South Asia, from Africa to the Americas, from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, weve witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order.  At time, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of race or tribe.  And often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world.  In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much theyre willing to tolerate freedom for others. That is what we saw play out in the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world.  Now, I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well -- for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and every faith.  We are home to Muslims who worship across our country.  We not only respect the freedom of religion, we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe.  We understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them. I know there are some who ask why we dont just ban such a video.  And the answer is enshrined in our laws:  Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech.  Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense.  Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs.  As President of our country and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day -- and I will always defend their right to do so. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense.  Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs.  As President of our country and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day -- and I will always defend their right to do so. We do so because given the power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression; it is more speech -- the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect. Now, I know that not all countries in this body share this particular understanding of the protection of free speech.  We recognize that.  But in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete.  The question, then, is how do we respond?", "filename": "25September2012UnitedNations67thSessionGeneralAssemblySpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Now, the reason that we're even thinking about the sequester is because people are rightly concerned about the deficit and the debt.  But there is a sensible way of doing things and there is a dumb way of doing things.  I mean, think about your own family.  Let's say that suddenly you've got a little less money coming in. Are you going to say, well, we'll cut out college tuition for the kid, we'll stop feeding the little guy over here, we won't pay our car note even though that means we can't get to work -- thats not what you do, right?  You step back and you say, what is it that's important -- our child's education, making sure they're healthy, making sure we can get to the job, keeping our house repaired?  And then you say, here are the things that aren't so important and you cut those out.  You prioritize, and you make smart decisions.  Well, we should be doing the same thing.    Now, Ive laid out a plan that details how we can pay down our deficit in a way thats balanced and responsible.  We have the plan right on a website, the White House website.  Everybody can go see it.  It details exactly how we can cut programs that don't work, how we can raise money by closing loopholes that are only serving a few, as opposed to the average American.  We detailed $930 billion in sensible spending cuts that were willing to make and $580 billion in wasteful tax loopholes and deductions that were willing to eliminate through tax reform.  And what I've said is if the Republicans in Congress dont like every detail of my proposal, which I don't expect them to, Ive told them my door is open.  I am more than willing to negotiate.  I want to compromise.  There's no reason why we can't come together and find a sensible way to reduce the deficit over the long term without affecting vital services, without hurting families, without impacting outstanding facilities like this one and our national defense.  There's a way of doing this.  And the fact is there are leaders in both parties throughout this country who want to do the same.  I've got to give Scott Rigell credit.  He is one of your Republican congressmen whos with us here today -- and that's not always healthy for a Republican, being with me.  But the reason hes doing it is because he knows it's important to you.  And hes asked his colleagues in the House to consider closing tax loopholes instead of letting these automatic cuts go through.  Hes concerned about the deficit, and hes more than prepared to make some really tough cuts, but he wants to do it in a smart way.  Bobby Scott -- same thing.  Some of the cuts we've proposed, Bobby might not think are perfect, but he knows that we've got to make some tough decisions.  He just wants to make sure that you aren't the ones who are adversely impacted and that we're sharing the sacrifice in bringing down our deficit; we're not just dumping it on a few people and we're not doing it in a dumb way. Senators like John McCain have made similar statements to what Scott said.  Your Republican Governor along with other governors around the country have said they want Congress to stop the sequester, to stop these cuts.   But I just have to be honest with you.  There are too many Republicans in Congress right now who refuse to compromise even an inch when it comes to closing tax loopholes and special interest tax breaks.  And that's what's holding things up right now.  Keep in mind, nobody is asking them to raise income tax rates.  All were asking is to consider closing tax loopholes and deductions that the Speaker of the House, John Boehner, said he was willing to do just a few months ago.  He said there were a bunch of loopholes and deductions you could close.  He said you could raise $800 billion, a trillion dollars by closing loopholes.  Well, we're not even asking for that much.  All we're asking is that they close loopholes for the well-off and the well-connected -- for hedge fund managers, or oil companies, or corporate jet owners who are all doing very well and dont need these tax loopholes -- so we can avoid laying off workers, or kicking kids off Head Start, or reducing financial aid for college students.  I dont think thats too much to ask.  I do not think that is partisan.  The majority of the American people agree with me.  The majority of Newport News agrees with me.  We need to get this done. But the choice is up to Congress.  Only Congress has the power to pass a law that stops these damaging cuts and replaces them with smart savings and tax reform.  And the second I get that bill on my desk, I will sign it into law.  But I've got to get Congress to pass it.  None of us will get 100 percent of what we want.  Democrats, they've got to make some tough choices too. Democrats like me, we've said we're prepared to make some tough cuts and reforms, including to programs like Medicare.  But if we're willing to compromise, then Republicans in the House have to compromise as well.  Thats what democracy is about.  Thats what this country needs right now. So let me just make one last point, by the way, for those of you who are following this.  Now, lately, some people have been saying, well, maybe we'll just give the President some flexibility.  He could make the cuts the way he wants and that way it won't be as damaging.  The problem is when you're cutting $85 billion in seven months, which represents over a 10-percent cut in the defense budget in seven months, there's no smart way to do that.  There's no smart way to do that.  You don't want to have to choose between, let's see, do I close funding for the disabled kid, or the poor kid?  Do I close this Navy shipyard or some other one?  When you're doing things in a way that's not smart, you can't gloss over the pain and the impact it's going to have on the economy.   And the broader point is, Virginia, we cant just cut our way to prosperity.  We cant just cut our way to prosperity.  We can't ask seniors and working families like yours to shoulder the entire burden of deficit reduction while asking nothing more from the wealthiest and the most powerful.  We're not going to grow the middle class just by shifting the cost of health care or college onto families that are already struggling, or forcing communities to lay off more teachers or cops or firefighters or shipbuilders, and then folks who are doing really well dont have to do anything more.  Thats not fair, and it's not good for the economy.  And the other thing we've got to do is to stop having these crises manufactured every month.  It seems like -- I know you guys must get tired of it.  Didnt we just solve this thing?  Now we've got another thing coming up?  I mean, think about if Mike Petters ran his business this way -- once every month or two there would be some crisis, and you wouldnt be sure whether or not you were working or not.  Even if it got solved eventually or ultimately, it would be pretty discouraging on people.  You would be less productive.  Ships wouldnt get built as fast.  You would waste money because you dont know exactly what to expect.

It is great to be back in Kenya.  Thank you so much for this extraordinary welcome.  I know it took a few years, but as President I try to keep my promises, and I said I was going to come, and I'm here. Everybody, go ahead and have a seat.  I'm going to be talking for a while.  Relax. I want to thank my sister, [Dr.] Auma [Obama], for a wonderful introduction.  Im so glad that she could be with us here today. And it was -- as she said, it was Auma who first guided me through Kenya almost 30 years ago. To President Kenyatta, I want to thank you once again for the hospitality that youve shown to me -- and for our work together on this visit, and for being here today.  It's a great honor. I am proud to be the first American President to come to Kenya -- and, of course, I'm the first Kenyan-American to be President of the United States.  That goes without saying. Audience Member:  I love you, Obama! President Obama:  I love you back.  I do. But, as Auma was saying, the first time I came to Kenya, things were a little different.  When I arrived at Kenyatta Airport, the airline lost my bags.  That doesnt happen on Air Force One.  They always have my luggage on Air Force One.  As she said, Auma picked me up in an old Volkswagon Beetle, and think the entire stay I was here it broke down four or five times.  Wed be on the highway, wed have to call the jua kali -- hed bring us tools.  Wed be sitting there, waiting.  And I slept on a cot in her apartment.  Instead of eating at fancy banquets with the President, we were drinking tea and eating Ugali -- and Sukuma Wiki. So there wasnt a lot of luxury.  Sometimes the lights would go out.  They still do -- is that what someone said?   But there was something more important than luxury on that first trip, and that was a sense of being recognized, being seen.  I was a young man and I was just a few years out of University.  I had worked as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods in Chicago.  I was about to go to law school.  And when I came here, in many ways I was a Westerner, I was an American, unfamiliar with my father and his birthplace, really disconnected from half of my heritage.  And at that airport, as I was trying to find my luggage, there was a woman there who worked for the airlines, and she was helping fill out the forms, and she saw my name and she looked up and she asked if I was related to my father, who she had known.  And that was the first time that my name meant something.  And that was recognized. And over the course of several weeks, Id meet my brothers and aunts and uncles.  I traveled to Alego, the village where my family was from. I saw the graves of my father and my grandfather.  And I learned things about their lives that I could have never learned through books.  And in many ways, their lives offered snapshots of Kenyas history, but they also told us something about the future. My grandfather, for example, he was a cook for the British. And as I went through some of his belongings when I went up-country, I found the passbook he had had to carry as a domestic servant.  It listed his age and his height, his tribe, listed the number of teeth he had missing.  And he was referred to as a boy, even though he was a grown man, in that passbook. And he was in the Kings African Rifles during the Second World War, and was taken to the far reaches of the British Empire -- all the way to Burma.  And back home after the war, he was eventually detained for a time because he was linked to a group that opposed British rule.  And eventually he was released.  He forged a home for himself and his family.  He earned the respect of his village, lived a life of dignity -- although he had a well-earned reputation for being so strict that everybody was scared of him and he became estranged from part of his family. So that was his story.  And then my father came of age as Kenyans were pursuing independence, and he was proud to be a part of that liberation generation.  And next to my grandfathers papers, I found letters that he had written to 30 American universities asking for a chance to pursue his dream and get a scholarship.  And ultimately, one university gave him that chance -- the University in Hawaii.  And he would go on to get an education and then return home. And here, at first he found success as an economist and worked with the government.  But ultimately, he found disappointment -- in part because he couldn't reconcile the ideas that he had for his young country with the hard realities that had confronted him. And I think sometimes about what these stories tell us, what the history and the past tell us about the future.  They show the enormous barriers to progress that so many Kenyans faced just one or two generations ago.  This is a young country.  We were talking last night at dinner -- the Presidents father was the first President.  We're only a generation removed.  And the daily limitations -- and sometimes humiliations -- of colonialism -- that's recent history.  The corruption and cronyism and tribalism that sometimes confront young nations -- that's recent history. But what these stories also tell us is an arch of progress  -- from foreign rule to independence; from isolation to education, and engagement with a wider world.  It speaks of incredible progress.  So we have to know the history of Kenya, just as we Americans have to know our American history.  All people have to understand where they come from.  But we also have to remember why these lessons are important. We know a history so that we can learn from it.  We learn our history because we understand the sacrifices that were made before, so that when we make sacrifices we understand we're doing it on behalf of future generations. Theres a proverb that says, We have not inherited this land from our forebears, we have borrowed it from our children. In other words, we study the past so it can guide us into the future, and inspire us to do better. And when it comes to the people of Kenya -- particularly the youth -- I believe there is no limit to what you can achieve.  A young, ambitious Kenyan today should not have to do what my grandfather did, and serve a foreign master.  You don't need to do what my father did, and leave your home in order to get a good education and access to opportunity.  Because of Kenyas progress, because of your potential, you can build your future right here, right now. Now, like any country, Kenya is far from perfect, but it has come so far in just my lifetime.  After a bitter struggle, Kenyans claimed their independence just a few years after I was born.  And after decades of one party-rule, Kenya embraced a multi-party system in the 1990s, just as I was beginning my own political career in the United States. Tragically, just under a decade ago, Kenya was nearly torn apart by violence at the same time that I was running for my first campaign for President.  And I remember hearing the reports of thousands of innocent people being killed or driven from their homes.  And from a distance, it seemed like the Kenya that I knew -- a Kenya that was able to reach beyond ethnic and tribal lines -- that it might split apart across those lines of tribe and ethnicity. But look what happened.  The people of Kenya chose not to be defined by the hatreds of the past -- you chose a better history.   The voices of ordinary people, and political leaders and civil society did not eliminate all these divisions, but you addressed the divisions and differences peacefully.  And a new constitution was put in place, declaring that every person has inherent dignity -- and the right to have that dignity respected and protected.  A competitive election went forward -- not without problems, but without the violence that so many had feared.  In other words, Kenyans chose to stay together.  You chose the path of Harambee. And in part because of this political stability, Kenyas economy is also emerging -- and the entrepreneurial spirit that people rely on to survive in the streets of Kibera can now be seen in new businesses across the country.  From the city square to the smallest villages, MPesa is changing the way people use money.  New investment is making Kenya a hub for regional trade.  When I came here as a U.S. senator, I pointed out that South Koreas economy was the same as Kenyas when I was born, and then was 40 times larger than Kenyas.  Think about that.  It started at the same place -- South Korea had gone here, and Kenya was here.  But today, that gap has been cut in half just in the last decade.  Which means Kenya is making progress. And meanwhile, Kenya continues to carve out a distinct place in the community of nations:  As a source of peacekeepers for places torn apart by conflict, a host for refugees driven from their homes.  A leader for conservation, following the footprints of Wangari Maathai.  Kenya is one of the places on this continent that truly observes freedom of the press, and their fearless journalists and courageous civil society members. And in the United States, we see the legacy of Kip Keino every time a Kenyan wins one of our marathons.  And maybe the First Lady of Kenya is going to win one soon.  I told the President he has to start running with his wife.  We want him to stay fit. So theres much to be proud of -- much progress to lift up.  It's a good-news story.  But we also know the progress is not complete.  There are still problems that shadow ordinary Kenyans every day -- challenges that can deny you your livelihood, and sometimes deny you lives. As in America -- and so many countries around the globe -- economic growth has not always been broadly shared.  Sometimes people at the top do very well, but ordinary people still struggle.  Today, a young child in Nyanza Province is four times more likely to die than a child in Central Province -- even though they are equal in dignity and the eyes of God.  That's a gap that has to be closed.  A girl in Rift Valley is far less likely to attend secondary school than a girl in Nairobi.  That's a gap that has to be closed.  Across the country, one study shows corruption costs Kenyans 250,000 jobs every year -- because every shilling thats paid as a bribe could be put into the pocket of somebody whos actually doing an honest days work. And despite the hard-earned political progress that I spoke of, those political gains still have to be protected.  New laws and restrictions could close off the space where civil society gives individual citizens a voice and holds leaders accountable. Old tribal divisions and ethnic divisions can still be stirred up.  I want to be very clear here -- a politics thats based solely on tribe and ethnicity is a politics that's doomed to tear a country apart.  It is a failure -- a failure of imagination. Of course, here, in Kenya, we also know the specter of terrorism has touched far too many lives.  And we remember the Americans and Kenyans who died side by side in the attack on our embassy in the 90s.  We remember the innocent Kenyans who were taken from us at Westgate Mall.  We weep for the nearly 150 people slaughtered at Garissa -- including so many students who had such a bright future before them.  We honor the memory of so many other innocent Kenyans whose lives have been lost in this struggle. So Kenya is at a crossroads -- a moment filled with peril, but also enormous promise.  And with the rest of my time here today, Id like to talk about how you can seize the moment, how you can make sure we leave behind a world thats better -- a world that we borrowed from our children. When I first came to sub-Saharan Africa as President, I made clear my strong belief that the future of Africa is up to Africans.  For too long, I think that many looked to the outside for salvation and focused on somebody else being at fault for the problems of the continent.  And as my sister said, ultimately we are each responsible for our own destiny.  And I'm here as President of a country that sees Kenya as an important partner.  Im here as a friend who wants Kenya to succeed. And the pillars of that success are clear:  Strong democratic governance; development that provides opportunity for all people and not just some; a sense of national identity that rejects conflict for a future of peace and reconciliation. And today, we can see that future for Kenya on the horizon. But tough choices are going to have to be made in order to arrive at that destination.  In the United States, I always say that what makes America exceptional is not the fact that were perfect, it's the fact that we struggle to improve.  We're self-critical.  We work to live up to our highest values and ideals, knowing that we're not always going to achieve them perfectly, but we keep on trying to perfect our union. And whats true for America is also true for Kenya.  You can't be complacent and accept the world just as it is.  You have to imagine what the world might be and then push and work toward that future.  Progress requires that you honestly confront the dark corners of our own past; extend rights and opportunities to more of your citizens; see the differences and diversity of this country as a strength, just as we in America try to see the diversity of our country as a strength and not a weakness.  So you can choose the path to progress, but it requires making some important choices. First and foremost, it means continuing down the path of a strong, more inclusive, more accountable and transparent democracy. Democracy begins with a peacefully-elected government.  It begins with elections.  But it doesnt stop with elections.  So your constitution offers a road map to governance thats more responsive to the people -- through protections against unchecked power, more power in the hands of local communities.  For this system to succeed, there also has to be space for citizens to exercise their rights. And we saw the strength of Kenyas civil society in the last election, when groups collected reports of incitement so that violence could be stopped before it spun out of control.  And the ability of citizens to organize and advocate for change -- that's the oxygen upon which democracy depends.  Democracy is sometimes messy, and for leaders, sometimes it's frustrating.  Democracy means that somebody is always complaining about something.  Nobody is ever happy in a democracy about their government.  If you make one person happy, somebody else is unhappy.  Then sometimes somebody who you made happy, later on, now theyre not happy.  They say, what have you done for me lately?  But that's the nature of democracy. That's why it works, is because it's constantly challenging leaders to up their game and to do better. And such civic participation and freedom is also essential for rooting out the cancer of corruption.  Now, I want to be clear.  Corruption is not unique to Kenya.  I mean, I want everybody to understand that theres no country that's completely free of corruption.  Certainly here in the African continent there are many countries that deal with this problem.  And I want to assure you I speak about it wherever I go, not just here in Kenya.  So I don't want everybody to get too sensitive. But the fact is, too often, here in Kenya -- as is true in other places -- corruption is tolerated because thats how things have always been done.  People just think that that is sort of the normal state of affairs.  And there was a time in the United States where that was true, too.  My hometown of Chicago was infamous for Al Capone and the Mob and organized crime corrupting law enforcement.  But what happened was that over time people got fed up, and leaders stood up and they said, we're not going to play that game anymore.  And you changed a culture and you changed habits. Here in Kenya, it's time to change habits, and decisively break that cycle.  Because corruption holds back every aspect of economic and civil life.  Its an anchor that weighs you down and prevents you from achieving what you could.  If you need to pay a bribe and hire somebodys brother -- whos not very good and doesnt come to work -- in order to start a business, well, thats going to create less jobs for everybody.  If electricity is going to one neighborhood because theyre well-connected, and not another neighborhood, thats going to limit development of the country as a whole.  If someone in public office is taking a cut that they don't deserve, thats taking away from those who are paying their fair share. So this is not just about changing one law -- although it's important to have laws on the books that are actually being enforced.  Its important that not only low-level corruption is punished, but folks at the top, if they are taking from the people, that has to be addressed as well.  But it's not something that is just fixed by laws, or that any one person can fix.  It requires a commitment by the entire nation -- leaders and citizens -- to change habits and to change culture. Tough laws need to be on the books.  And the good news is, your government is taking some important steps in the right direction.  People who break the law and violate the public trust need to be prosecuted.  NGOs have to be allowed to operate who shine a spotlight on what needs to change.  And ordinary people have to stand up and say, enough is enough.  It's time for a better future. And as you take these steps, I promise that America will continue to be your partner in supporting investments in strong, democratic institutions. Now, we're also going to work with you to pursue the second pillar of progress, and that is development that extends economic opportunity and dignity for all of Kenyas people. America partners with Kenya in areas where youre making enormous progress, and we focus on what Kenyans can do for themselves and building capacity; on entrepreneurship, where Kenya is becoming an engine for innovation; on access to power, where Kenya is developing clean energy that can reach more people; on the important issue of climate change, where Kenyas recent goal to reduce its emissions has put it in the position of being a leader on the continent; on food security, where Kenyan crops are producing more to meet the demands of your people and a global market; and on health, where Kenya has struck huge blows against HIV/AIDS and other diseases, while building up the capacity to provide better care in your communities. America is also partnering with you on an issue thats fundamental to Kenyas future:  We are investing in youth.  We are investing in the young people of Kenya and the young people of this continent.  Robert F. Kennedy once said, It is a revolutionary world that we live in, and it is the young people who must take the lead.1  It's the young people who must take the lead. So through our Young African Leaders Initiative -- we are empowering and connecting young people from across the continent who are filled with energy and optimism and idealism, and are going to take Africa to new heights.  And these young people, theyre not weighted down by the old ways.  Theyre creating a new path.  And these are the elements for success in this 21st century. To continue down this path of progress, it will be vital for Kenya to recognize that no country can achieve its full potential unless it draws on the talents of all its people -- and that must include the half of Kenyans -- maybe a little more than half --who are women and girls.  Now, I'm going to spend a little time on this just for a second.  Every country and every culture has traditions that are unique and help make that country what it is.  But just because something is a part of your past doesnt make it right.  It doesnt mean that it defines your future. Look at us in the United States.  Recently, we've been having a debate about the Confederate flag.  Some of you may be familiar with this.  This was a symbol for those states who fought against the Union to preserve slavery.  Now, as a historical artifact, it's important.  But some have argued that it's just a symbol of heritage that should fly in public spaces. The fact is it was a flag that flew over an army that fought to maintain a system of slavery and racial subjugation.  So we should understand our history, but we should also recognize that it sends a bad message to those who were liberated from slavery and oppression. And in part because of an unspeakable tragedy that took place recently, where a young man who was a fan of the Confederate flag and racial superiority shot helpless people in a church, more and more Americans of all races are realizing now that that flag should come down.  Just because something is a tradition doesnt make it right. Well, so around the world, there is a tradition of repressing women and treating them differently, and not giving them the same opportunities, and husbands beating their wives, and children not being sent to school.  Those are traditions.  Treating women and girls as second-class citizens, those are bad traditions.  They need to change.  Theyre holding you back. Treating women as second-class citizens is a bad tradition. It holds you back.  Theres no excuse for sexual assault or domestic violence.  Theres no reason that young girls should suffer genital mutilation.  Theres no place in civilized society for the early or forced marriage of children.  These traditions may date back centuries; they have no place in the 21st century. These are issues of right and wrong -- in any culture.  But theyre also issues of success and failure.  Any nation that fails to educate its girls or employ its women and allowing them to maximize their potential is doomed to fall behind in a global economy. You know, we're in a sports center.  Imagine if you have a team and you don't let half of the team play.  That's stupid.  That makes no sense.  And the evidence shows that communities that give their daughters the same opportunities as their sons, they are more peaceful, they are more prosperous, they develop faster, they are more likely to succeed.  That's true in America.  That's true here in Kenya.  It doesnt matter. And that's why one of the most successful development policies you can pursue is giving girls and education, and removing the obstacles that stand between them and their dreams. And by the way, if you educate girls -- they grow up to be moms  -- and they, because theyre educated, are more likely to produce educated children.  So Kenya will not succeed if it treats women and girls as second-class citizens.  I want to be very clear about that. Now, this leads me to the third pillar of progress, and that's choosing a future of peace and reconciliation. There are real threats out there.  President Kenyatta and I spent a lot of time discussing the serious threat from al-Shabaab that Kenya faces.  The United States faces similar threats of terrorism.  We are grateful for the sacrifices made by Kenyans on the front lines as part of AMISOM.  Were proud of the efforts that we're making to strengthen Kenyas capabilities through our new Security Governance Initiative.  We're going to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you in this fight against terrorism for as long as it takes. But, as I mentioned yesterday, it is important to remember that violent extremists want us to turn against one another.  That's what terrorists typically try to exploit.  They know that they are a small minority; they know that they can't win conventionally.  So what they try to do is target societies where they can exploit divisions.  That's what happens in Iraq.  That's what happens around the world.  That's what happened in Northern Ireland.  Terrorists who try to sow chaos, they must be met with force and they must also be met, though, with a forceful commitment to uphold the rule of law, and respect for human rights, and to treat everybody whos peaceful and law-abiding fairly and equally. Extremists who prey on distrust must be defeated by communities who stand together and stand for something different. And the most important example here is, is that the United States and Kenya both have Muslim minorities, but those minorities make enormous contributions to our countries.  These are our brothers, they are our sisters.  And so in both our countries, we have to reject calls that allow us to be divided. This is true for any diverse society.  And Kenya is rich with diversity -- with many dozens of tribes and ethnicities, and languages and religious groups.  And time and again, just as weve seen the dangers of religious or ethnic violence, weve seen that Kenya is stronger when Kenyans stand united -- with a sense of national identity.  That was the case on December 12, 1963, when cities and villages across this country celebrated the birth of a nation.  It was true in 2010, when Kenya replaced the anarchy of ethnic violence with the order of a new constitution. So we can all appreciate our own identities, our bloodlines, our beliefs, our backgrounds -- that tapestry is what makes us who we are.  But the history of Africa -- which is both the cradle of human progress and a crucible of conflict -- shows us that when define ourselves narrowly, in opposition to somebody just because theyre of a different tribe, or race, or religion  -- and we ignore who is a good person or a bad person, are they working hard or not, are they honest or not, are they peaceful or violent -- when we start making distinctions solely based on status and not what people do, then we're taking the wrong path and we inevitably suffer in the end. This is why Martin Luther King called on people to be judged not by the color of their skin but the content of their character.  And in the same way, people should not be judged by their last name, or their religious faith, but by their content of their character and how they behave.  Are they good citizens?  Are they good people?", "filename": "26July2015AddresstothePeopleofKenya.txt"}, {"question": "I just gave a very long speech.  Audience Comment: We saw it.   President Obama:  You're saying it was also too long?  Is that what you're saying?  She nodded.  She was all like, yes, it was very long.  So because you just saw my speech, it doesnt make sense for me to give a whole nother speech.  I'm really here more to listen and to learn. But I do want to just make a couple of brief remarks at the top.  And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to call on a number of you.  I've got a few names already to get us started, and then depending on how much time we have, then I'll try to see if I can call on some additional persons. America has historically been a country of people who participate in the lives of their communities and their societies.  And it's one of the things that make us, I believe, a great nation.  Theres a famous French writer named Alec de Tocqueville, who traveled to the United States, and wrote a very famous book called Democracy in America.  And the point that he made in this book during the course of his travels was that what made America a democracy was not just that it had elections, but that it was a society of joiners and volunteers, and people who wanted constantly to be involved in making their communities better.  And if there was an injustice, they wanted to do something about it.  And they would form organizations and they would form town halls, and disseminate information -- so that what the government did was obviously important, but what was just as important was what individual citizens were able to do to create a fabric of mutual concern and regard and advocacy that would shape government policy and would shape how societies were organized. And almost all the progress that America has made in expanding freedom and opportunity has grown as a result of that bottom-up civic participation.  The civil rights movement, the womens rights movement, the movement most recently to make sure that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters have equal rights, the movement to end wars, in some cases, the movement to provide better resources for poor children.  And theres the halfway house movement, and the movement to -- the settlement house movement, rather, and to make sure that children and orphans were properly cared for.  The movement to public education and public universities.  The environmental movement. So many of these things arose because ordinary citizens started to get together and speak out and press their demands on their government. And eventually, politicians responded.   And I got my start in public life not as an elected official but as a community organizer in a poor neighborhood in Chicago.  And I would work with churches and community groups to try to improve the school system, or bring affordable housing.  And we weren't always completely successful, but it taught me the importance of the voices of ordinary people when they come together to create a better vision for the future. And that's why I think civil society is so important.  And that's why I emphasized it in the speech that I made today.  And this is something that I emphasize wherever I go -- democracy does not stop on Election Day.  For a real democracy to work, and for a society to thrive and continually improve, it requires that people continue to participate.  And there have to be laws in place to protect that space and facilitate peoples ability to participate.   Now, the good news is, here in Kenya, you now have a constitution that creates the space for such participation.  Alongside freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly, and the ability to organize politically, these are precious freedoms that have to be protected. Because Kenya is a young democracy theres always a concern that it might slip back and that space might narrow, despite what the constitution says.  And I just want to say part of the reason why it's important for me to be here today is to send a message that we in the United States at least believe that civil society is important and we want to continue to affirm it, and we want to listen and hear what it is that ordinary citizens, working together, have to say about their communities and about their lives. And if Kenya can continue to cultivate those habits of participation and citizenship and freedom, then the country is going to be better off, and it's going to continue to make progress for all people and not just some.   So with those opening remarks, what I want to do now is just open it up for conversation.  And I have in my hand some names to call on.  I may not get through all of them.  I think youve been instructed to try to be relatively brief.  In some cases, what I'll do is I'll respond right away to the comments.  In some cases, I may wait and respond at the end.  But this is designed not so much as a town hall, to ask me questions, it's more designed for you to give me a sense of the things that are important to you, so that I can learn -- and because I think this is going to be televised -- so that the Kenya people as a whole can hear as well. And the only thing I would ask is that everybody be respectful.  And one of the rules of good civil society I believe is that youre respectful of the people who disagree with you.  And that's part of what makes civil society work.  If you can have civil disagreements, and you can listen to each other and not just shout, that's what creates an environment that leads to progress over the long term. And the only other thing I'm going to do is, because it's warm, I'm going to take off my jacket.  You're free to do so as well.  This is pretty relaxed.  Okay, so -- and we've got a few topics where we've got some civil society organizations that are already working on some of these issues. And one of the topics that hasnt gotten a lot of attention during my trip but I consider very important because it's part of Kenyas heritage, but it's also part of global heritage -- and that is the issue of wildlife trafficking, where active citizens are really making a difference. And I'm going to call on Tom Lalampaa of the Northern Rangelands Trust, to tell us about what hes doing. Mr. Lalampaa:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I work for Northern Rangelands Trust Entity, an umbrella community organization currently supporting over 30 community-based conservancies.   We've had a lot of successes on the trafficking as well.  But I just want to mention two high-level impacts.  One is that we've been able to develop a model of a community conservancy that is unique, that has proven very successful, now widely accepted by the national government and the county governments.  And all the model has is that, first and foremost, is that it is grassroots-rooted.  It's formed by the local communities -- by the elders, the women and the youth in the villages.  And so these institutions help to anchor good governance, gender matters, awareness, micro-finance for our youth and our women, s well, and many, many more programs, including the -- getting water.  It's become an entry point for the national government and the county governments to deliver services to the local communities. It's also structured in such a way that the political leaders take part in those institutions.  So they are local community institutions that are registered with the government.  And it's just amazing, because they are creating a platform for dialogue -- a platform for communities to decide where they want water, where they want help, where they want -- what they want to do in matters. The second high-level impact, Mr. President, is getting conservation to drive peace and conflict resolution in northern Kenya.  In northern Kenya, peace and security is quite elusive for many reasons.  One is because of illegal firearms.  Secondly, it's just because of the nature of the mistrust among our ethic communities.  And thirdly, also because of the natural resources -- pasture, water for our cattle.  And so we've managed to get the conservation to drive peace and conflict resolution in northern Kenya.  I was telling my friend, Paula, here that when communities, local communities -- they want peace.  Theres no way the elephants live in peace.  So that's what I'm saying, Mr. President, that all that has been made possible through the support of the U.S. government, and in particular, through the USAID Kenya. Mr. President, we have a number of challenges, but I'll put them in terms of a kind request to you.  One, wed appreciate the U.S. government support to protect and conserve the remaining African elephants.  I'm saying the remaining because we have lost many.  You can help us in three ways.  First and foremost is to crush demand and market, Mr. President.  Not even reducing it.  if we can, lets crush it once and for all. The Kenya government -- the civil society, ourselves, and the local communities can only prevent poaching from the source, from being poached.  But the markets and the demand, Mr. President, are far outside our borders.  We are helpless.  Please help us. The other way you can help us protect and conserve the remaining African elephants, Mr. President, is to get the U.S. government be a member of the African-led elephants protection initiative.  Currently, nine African states have signed to it.  So it would just bring enormous support and recognition if your government can join it and also be a part of it. Thirdly, in terms of helping us conserve and protect our elephants, the remaining, is to help us deal with the ivory.  The second request that I think would benefit all of us here, Mr. President, my request also is that if possible -- we notice this is discussed all the time, but our humble request of the U.S. government is to increase the international support for the international programs.  And I have in mind, I talk about the U.S. aid that's involved, and any other U.S. government-related development agencies -- because it's from that pot that we are going to support conservation, that we can improve livelihoods, that we can support governance. I always have a feeling that the USAID office, wherever they are in Africa, and in the world, they get massive applications, and they can only deal with so much.  Lastly, Mr. President, I must admit the fact that the embassys office -- the USAID offices have been very good with us and extremely supportive. Thank you so much, Mr. President. President Obama:  Let me just say, first of all, Tom, youre an eloquent spokesman for your cause and that was an excellent presentation.  The second thing I have to say is that everybody is going to have to be briefer than Tom.  Just because I want to make sure that I get as many comments as possible. The third point is, with respect to conservation, you said the elephants that have been lost -- 20,000 elephants have been lost in recent years. And part of the reason why civil society has to be mobilized around conservation is that if people have a choice -- if they see a false choice between their own livelihoods and conserving animals then the animals will lose.  If theyre organized so that they see that preservation and conservation enhances their lives, then we win, because they feel ownership and they will participate. And that's why the organizations that you're putting together are so important.   Now, we've got another person just on this issue before we move to another issue -- Paula Kahumbu, right here.  I could tell because shes got an arm band that says, Hands Off Our Elephants.  With the Wildlife Trust.   Ms. Kahumbu:  Thank you, Mr. President.  First, on behalf of all the conservation community -- and there are several people in the room -- thank you so much for your initiatives on the African elephant in particular. More than 30,000 elephants -- President Obama:  30,000. Ms. Kahumbu:  -- are being killed every year in Africa.  That's one every 15 minutes.  Your grandchildren elephants.  I love elephants.  I want the whole world to fall in love with elephants.  And I started this campaign, Hands Off Our Elephants, under the organization, Wildlife Direct, with the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta, to empower and mobilize Kenyans, Africans across the entire continent to save elephants.  They are our heritage.  They are our identity.  And it's our duty.  And it's not just Africans who benefit from this.  The whole world benefits.   It's not been easy, but our work has really led to a change in the hearts and minds of Kenyans, and also the laws.  We've been at the center of judicial reforms in this country.  Our work has led to the arrest of one of the most -- what do I say --notorious suspected ivory kingpins, Feisal Mohamed Ali.  For the first time in Kenya, an ivory trafficker is behind bars.  And that's thanks to support from your embassy, through Ambassador Godec, and many other organizations.   And while we're succeeding locally in Kenya, poaching is down, the problem across Africa is escalating, and the demand for ivory is actually exploding.  We're dealing with a wildlife crisis alone.  We're dealing with international wildlife crime.  And that's why my organization goes after traffickers.  We're dealing with people who are funding terrorism, and we're dealing with a crime that is fueled by corruption.   So we have two requests.  The first is that you take this message back to the American people.  We're often asked, how can we help.  It's very simple:  Tell the American people, don't buy ivory.  It's the simplest way to help.  Secondly, we request that the USA takes a lead in pursuing international wildlife traffickers with the same vigor and rigor that you apply to money laundering and drug crimes.  And we believe that this can be done through strengthening your legal assistance role not just in the demand countries, but source countries and transit countries.   Because we know that the number of people involved in this crime is actually relatively small compared to those other crimes.  And so we can crush this very quickly and end the war and save elephants for all of humanity.   Thank you.  President Obama:  Thank you.  Well, as you may have noted, yesterday one of our announcements was to be even stricter with respect to any ivory sales inside the United States.  I mean, we really are cracking down on that.   And with respect to the international networks, you're absolutely right that theres a connection between corrupt officials getting paid, criminals being armed, and the ivory trade.  You have this linkage that should be of concern to all of us.  And it's international in scope.   Most recently, the United States is involved in negotiations with the Asian countries, the Asia Pacific region -- something called the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  One of the things we're trying to accomplish in the trade agreement is for many of these countries with still strong demand for ivory to start getting much more serious about the enforcement of their laws, and have it embedded in the trade agreements that we initiate. So, hopefully, we'll be able to influence not just what happens in the United States, but also in some of the areas where the demand is heaviest. Another topic where we've seen some progress, and this is something that's close to my heart because I've got two daughters, and close to Michelles heart -- shes been involved internationally, trying to highlight the issue of girls education with what we're calling the Let Girls Learn initiative that involves many of our international agencies -- is the issue of girls education.  Obviously I've made it a big emphasis in my speech here today. So we've got a couple of people to talk about some of the work that's being done through civil society on this issue.  And I'm going to start with Kennedy Odede of Shining Hope for Communities. Mr. Odede:  Mr. President, it's my pleasure and privilege to meet someone like you who believes in grassroots change. You and I, we share one background that you did social work in Chicago and I'm doing it in Kibera where I grew up.  I grew us whereby it's really hard to make it. Theres no hope, no dream.  Many young men end up being -- go to crime.  It's easy for them -- if theyre not able to enjoy even tourism because they don't have a dream.  Theres no hope in them. Mr. President, I was really having a hard time in my community, but we said, enough is enough -- and, yes, we can!  We came together with a soccer ball and that became a movement that really circled around girls education.  We built the first school in Kibera called Kibera School for Girls and then started providing social services to men, too.  And that became world-changing. But my challenge is that how do you take a grassroots thing like this across Africa, and by having more partners joining that?", "filename": "26July2015KenyaCivilSocietyMeeting.txt"}, {"question": "Momposhi:  Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me this chance. Let me speak with you actually of a friend of mine.  At the age of 12, this friend -- she dropped out of school and underwent genital mutilation.  In my community, after undergoing such this, the [inaudible] said, she is ready for marriage.  She was married to a man older than her, twice her age.  And now at the age of 15, she has three children.  Shes not able to care for them, for their education.  She milks the cows in the morning and sells the milk so that she can have something to give to her children. For me, I got an opportunity to be at a boarding school in Kakenya Center.  I had all the chance to study and I had all the time. I learned to milk the cows for my mom and prepare my siblings to go back to school. But now I'm studying in Pangani Girls, and become the first girl in the center.  And now I would like to be a cardiologist and study at Harvard University.  President Obama:  That sounds good. Ms. Momposhi:  And also I would like to set an example to the girls in my community that a girl can really become a cardiologist.  Thank you.  President Obama:  That's wonderful.  Linet, hold on.  You were so inspiring.  Give Linet the mic back.  Linet, how old are you right now? Ms. Momposhi:  I'm 16 years old. President Obama:  Youre 16 years old.  And how did you come to be able to go to the boarding school? Ms. Momposhi:  I was helped by Kakenya, the Kakenya Center. And that's how I go to study in Kakenya Center.  And my dreams started working in that center where I had a chance to go to Maryhill but I went to Pangani Girls.  President Obama:  So there was a center there, and by you coming into the center, then you started having bigger dreams about what you might be able to do? Ms. Momposhi:  Okay, I never used to have big dreams like now.  Before joining the center, I never knew what I was going to do because I never had any hope in life. President Obama:  Yes.  So, Linet, I'm sure you're going to be an excellent cardiologist.  So we're very proud of you.  But it just sends a message in terms of why civil society is so important.  So many of our young people who have a lot of talent, but they just don't know whats possible.  And sometimes the most important thing is just to show them that this is what could happen in your life if you work hard.  And when they have a vision about what could happen, then suddenly theyre motivated, the same way that Linet is motivated.  And she stars having bigger ambitions about whats possible. That's part of the reason why civil society organizations that create mentorship programs and programs for young people to interact in different professions and talk to people who have succeeded is so important.  And in fact, in the United States I've set up something called My Brothers Keeper, designed to target disadvantaged youth so that they are connected to mentorship programs very similar to some of the work that resulted in Linet being inspired. In fact, we have young people who are mentors at the White House and we connect them with all of our senior staff.  And I have dinner with them and give them advice.  I don't know if they listen to the advice, but I think they do.  Linet, you're a very find young woman.  Congratulations.  We're very proud of you.  So one of the issues, obviously, thats been of concern lately in Kenya is terrorism.  This is an area where I'm working extensively with the government.  This is something that we're concerned about internationally.  And obviously given what happened in places like Westgate and Garissa, Kenya is a source of concern as well.  But as I said in the press conference yesterday, one of the important lessons that we've learned is that you can't just fight terrorism through military and the police.  You also have to change peoples hearts and minds, and give them a sense that theyre included in the society and enlist them in assisting in fighting against terrorism. And so I actually think that it's important to include civil society in the fight against terrorism.  That's what we're doing in the United States.  That's what we need to do here in Kenya as well.  And so we've got a couple of organizations that are here that I want to call on just to talk about the kind of work theyre doing and what theyre finding on the ground in dealing with this very important issue.  And I'm going to start with Hassan Ole Nado, who is with SUPKEM.  He's the deputy secretary general -- which is a very important title.  But, please, go ahead.  And describe for us what SUPKEM does.  Is it regionally located?  Is it national?  Or is it more along the coast?  Tell me about what its doing. Mr. Ole Nado:  Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity and also for having time with civil society in Kenya. The Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims is an umbrella organization of Muslim organizations in the country, particularly mosque and Muslim committees all over the country.  And also, we now have community-based organizations that are working at the community level, but they found time to advocate and to be part of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims. We are here, and we have been doing this work for the last two years because we are a little bit late in the journey, but we realize that its very important for the community to be engaged. We have worked before by developing a Countering Violent Extremism advocacy chapter.  That calls for community leaderships, calls for government engagement, and also brings other civil society organizations onboard so that we can be able to deal with this issue. As you have already said, terrorism is not about military or the police or other things.  Its more of community issues.  So it has both security and social aspect of it.  And I really thank you because of the White House summit, which I was privileged to attend with Hussein Khalid of Haki Africa.  And after that particular meeting, when we came back to Kenya we found an opportunity to engage with government.  Because before that White House summit, the engagement or relationship between civil society was a little bit lower.  But thanks to that conference, that really opened up the government to engage with civil society. Through that meeting, actually, we have been able, as civil society, to engage government in the development of a national counter-violent extremism strategy.  And I hope the government will [inaudible] the strategy very soon. We know a number of organizations who have been involved in this part of community projects, like Haki Africa and MUHURI are currently facing some problems.  And I hope through your engagement with the government, youd be able to raise concerns of these institutions.  I know that the American government cannot engage organizations that have relationships with terrorist organizations.  And I that is one of the things that really think it is important to protect institutions or individuals who engaged in this particular work. At the moment, we are also working with the returnees in this country -- we have young men and women who are somehow misadvised and found themselves in terrorist organizations.  They found a way of getting back to their country, and there are not clear ways of engagement.  I work with the government of Kenya because they gave amnesty to those who are willing to be given the amnesty.  At the moment, we are really engaging them, and the government is also opening up -- because at the moment now, they are also creating what they call interagency coordination centers at the county level where all arms of government are talking together before they take actions against suspected terrorists.  The Muslim community, the leadership are also now onboard and they are really working on the areas of counter-narrative, because there are two narratives here.  There is the ideological narrative and there is the old narrative of marginalization and other aspects.  We talk about perceptions in the narrative of marginalization -- they are real issues that we are calling the government to address those issues. One of the issues is the lack of identification documents for young people.  I think it is very important that that should too should be addressed.  We have a collapse of the education system in the northeast because of terror organizations.  And I hope, as struggle to find ways and answers of how to deal with this problem, it is important for USAID, which I know theyve done quite a lot of work in this country, to consider getting into education much more by engaging communities so that communities can run community-based organization education systems in the northeast so that we are avoid getting terrorists of tomorrow.  Because we have over 400,000 young children who are not going to school because everybody else is pulled from there, from the region.   Maybe if I could speak for many days, but I really thank you for this opportunity and also for having time with the civil society organizations.  President Obama:  Thank you.  Before you give up the mic, let me just ask you a question.  Im glad that because of the White House summit that we had on countering violent extremism, that there was a more constructive conversation that was taking place.   I think that point that you make is so important, which is reaching young people early.  What I hear you saying is, is that one of the problems that exists in certain parts of the country now is because of fear, in some cases, and some of the existing structures not operating as well as they should, that you just have children who dont have access to educational resources and a structure, and then that makes them more vulnerable to recruitment into an organization that can give them some sense of purpose or meaning, even if it ends up being a very negative one. Is that whats Im understanding? Mr. Ole Nado:  Yes, its actually -- that is what it is.  Because after the unfortunate terror attacks of Mandera, and later on the university in Garissa, those who were targeted -- because those are targeting were doing it deliberately to create interreligious tension in the country.  So we have those people, who are non-Muslims from the region, pulling out of the region because they feel its no longer safe for them to remain in that region. But by pulling out, the region has been exposed because it doesnt haven't adequate resources to address this gap that has emanated.  So to me, I think one of the things that need to consider is we need to build local organizations that can really break that gap at the community level, its more sustainable because theyre communities at a lower level. President Obama:  Thank you.  Thats very useful.  Somebody else I want to hear from is Fauzia Abdi Ali, whos with Women International Society.   Ms. Abdi Ali:  Thank you.  I must start by congratulating you.  The speech was really, really good because it really advocated for issues of women, which is an area of passion.  Im not speaking as WIS today, Im actually speaking as Sisters Without Borders, because I chair a platform of very inspirational women who work every single day in the field of peace and security, in particular countering violent extremism. So the women come from different parts of the country -- from northern Kenya, from the coastal region, and even here in Nairobi.  And now I engage mentees all towards ensuring we have a peaceful society.  We empower women from the household level to understand prevention, to understand early warning signs of radicalization of their kids, to look at prevention towards stigma that is associated with those mothers whose kids have actually joined violent extremism, or even their spouses.  We also look at empowering them through support groups where they can have a space to engage with other like-minded people and even learn from each other.  And we also ensure that this cross-border engagement between those within northern Kenya and those within the coastal region so that they dont feel alone in this whole concept of violent extremism. What is normally important for me is, when it comes to issues of peace and security, engagement with women is still minimal, and were still playing catchup.  When we are pushing for two-thirds, even within our own parliamentary systems, we are not looking at what these two-thirds will be doing.  And for us, we are pushing towards them having some concrete things that they will talk about within parliament.  And in particular is the issue of education.  Because for the women in northern Kenya, their children are actually not going to school; theyre not getting quality education.  And as Hassan has said, this ends up becoming a society that has young people who are not well educated and are more susceptible to violent extremism. Secondly, its the issue of the economy.  In places such as the coast region, this has affected the economy.  And this trickles down to the household level, and it affects the womans old economy within that structure.  So how can we have even this conversation going on?  And we try and link this to the national level. We also ensure that these discussions around policy on prevention has a gender lens.  Because the reasons why boys join and the reason why girls join is very different.  But when we are searching for solutions in policy, we try and group them together.  So sometimes, even when we are looking at issues of amnesty, we are not really opening up that space to understand if we are going to put a rehabilitation center, how do we make it different from when engaging with a boy and when engaging with a girl.  So that is very critical for us. One key thing I would love to put across is you started the first -- the conversation -- the White House conference in February, and it brought a lot more conversation here through the regional conference we had.  And I wanted to elevate that.  In terms of ensuring its more sustainable so that it pushes away from just discussion is to push for a hub that can be placed in Africa.  The hub we have is actually in the UAE, the United Arab Emirates --  which is useful for research and ensuring theres more conversation around how private sector gets involved, how civil society and governments can come together. But we dont have such hubs in Africa.  So in most cases, when you hear about capacity-building of CVE, we have to go outside Africa to get this capacity-building.  So why not actually start thinking about either expanding the global center to have a hub in Kenya, or somewhere in Africa for easy access for even the grassroots initiatives and civil society to also be engaged.  Thank you. President Obama:  Thank you.  That was an excellent presentation. Thank you. And I will very much take your remarks under advisement in terms of the possibilities of setting up a hub.  The idea of women being actively engaged in countering violent extremism is absolutely critical.  Mothers tend to be more sensible.  Im just telling the truth.  And obviously the younger were reaching children and giving them the sense that violence is not the right path, and thats being reinforced by their primary caregiver, which typically is the mother, and the idea of peer-to-peer support but also some peer pressure in terms of making sure that mothers are involved in steering their children in the right way -- I think thats a wonderful model.  Very exciting.  I just learned something there. So Ive got a little bit more time.  What Id like to do now is Im just going to call on some people.  But Im not going to be able to call on everybody, so I just want to say in advance.  But Im going to start with this young lady right there, in the sweater.  And please introduce yourself. Comment:  Thank you, Mr. President.  I am the CEO for Kamak [ph] Girls Initiative. Kamak Girls came about because of a problem -- I came from a family that had 45 children; out of it, 35 who are living.  Out of the 35, 20 were girls, 15 were boys.  And out of the 20 girls, only 11 went to school, four of them up to secondary, and one now up to the PhD level.  So my father was really for education.  He really tried his best.  But when he passed away in 2004, I realized as a bigger girl, number three, that I had work to do -- follow these girls who dropped out of school and see that they can live a more meaningful life towards education, health and economic development. So I gathered the four girls who are with me, and we started visiting them and find out how they are living.  Right now, I managed with my three sisters to take two to the university.  One has completed and has gotten a job.  One is in third form.  Two to diploma level; one of them we pushed and we opened at a city school where she was married.  And the other one went to forest school.  And to point, one of them where she was staying, she reached a class 8 and she has opened an inner-city school. President Obama:  Excellent. Comment Continued:  Our next step is to evaluate -- when we evaluate, we get girls of their range so that they can see what these girls have done, and also help the girls in the particular area. President Obama:  Okay. Comment Continued:  Yes.  And apart from that, Ive worked for 34 years, but Ive not gone very far because I started building our children from the [inaudible] and I started working and continue to.  I have three children. They have not gone very far because Im taking care of these people. So my request is that this group can move further so that whenever these girls are married, I can -- not only those girls of ours, but also the girls in that area can also see that they can do it.  Thank you so much.  President Obama:  Okay.  Well, thank you for your good efforts.   This young lady right there.  I ask everybody to try to be as brief as possible so I can get as many additional question as possible. Comment:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  I am here on behalf of the Devolution Forum.  Thats a civil society coalition that was set up early last year because we were very concerned about challenges to the implementation of devolution in Kenya.  And so Ill speak to just, very briefly, four points.  I have a more comprehensive memorandum.   But one is, were very concerned about the structure development assistance on devolution.  A lot of it is being channeled through the national government to go to the county governments, and this is contrary to the constitution which recognizes the two levels of government as having shared serenity. Now, this is a ploy by the government to keep power centralized.  Its really a method of controlling the governance structure.  So we find that even with the U.S., some of your programs are being channeled in this way, through the national government, for the county government.  And we find that this is bad for devolution.  We find also the World Bank very much is channeling -- they are funding in this direction. The other thing that Id like to address is -- to do with the war on terror. Weve noted that this an intergovernmental aspect to the war on terror. And because the security reforms have not been implemented to the pace that was supposed to be, we find that these intergovernmental institutions, such as the county policing authorities, the community policing, ideologically and even structurally have not been set up. Ideologically, we find that they are being taken as more information-gathering rather than community policing where communities get actively involved in their community policing.  So we are very concerned that as the U.S. assists the U.S. government, are you going to look at the ideological foundations of the structures that will engage citizens and the country governments in the security process?  Because if we dont do that, then it will undermine the war on terror and security. Ill pick one more because I -- President Obama:  Because youre running out of time. Question:  Im out of time.  Theres a trend in Africa where the civic space is being closed.  And were looking at countries like Rwanda, Ethiopia.  Were looking at our country.  And were wondering, whats the response of the U.S. government?  We heard your excellent remarks and sentiments, but of course you are working with a government that has demonstrated an intent to close the civic space.  So whats your approach going to be as you consolidate your work with the Kenyan government in terms of supporting civil society?", "filename": "26July2015KenyaCivilSocietyMeeting.txt"}, {"question": "President, eleven of your predecessors decided against going to Hiroshima.  What do you know that they didnt?  What were they worried about that you arent? And just sort of generally on nonproliferation -- because I think that's your focus and that's obviously a priority for you -- how do you communicate risks and concerns about this in a way that would do more to get it resolved?  Because it seems to be getting worse.  I mean, Americans worry a lot about terrorists with suicide vests, which are unlikely events that can kill dozens.  Do they worry enough about the risks of nuclear mishaps or attacks, which are unlikely events that could potentially kill millions instead of dozens?  In short, are we paying enough attention to Kim Jong-un and Pakistani tactical nuclear weapons, these sorts of things that you know are going on? President Obama:  Well, it's a terrific question.  First of all, I won't characterize how other Presidents were thinking about these issues.  I can tell you how I'm thinking about it, and that is that the dropping of the atomic bomb, the ushering in of nuclear weapons was an inflection point in modern history.  It is something that all of us have had to deal with in one way or another.  Obviously, it's not as prominent in people's thinking as it was during the Cold War, at a time when our parents or grandparents were huddling under desks in frequent drills.  But the backdrop of a nuclear event remains something that I think presses on the back of our imaginations. I do think that part of the reason I'm going is because I want to once again underscore the very real risks that are out there and the sense of urgency that we all should have.  So it's not only a reminder of the terrible toll of World War II and the death of innocents across continents, but it's also to remind ourselves that the job is not done in reducing conflict, building institutions of peace, and reducing the prospect of nuclear war in the future. In some ways, we've seen real progress over the last several years.  The Iran nuclear deal is a big piece of business -- because without us having to fire a shot, we were able to persuade a big, sophisticated country that had a well-developed nuclear program not to develop nuclear weapons. The START II Treaty that I negotiated in my first couple years in office with the Russians has reduced our respective stockpiles.  The Nuclear Security Summit and all the work that we've done on that score has made it less likely that nuclear materials fall into the hand of terrorists or non-state actors. And although we have not seen the kind of progress that I would have liked to have seen with respect to North Korea, what we have been able to do is mobilize the international community so that their proliferation activities are scrutinized much more carefully, and they have far fewer countries that are tolerant of potential actions by North Korea outside of their own program. Having said that, North Korea is a big worry for all of us.  They're not at the point right now where they can effectively hit U.S. targets, but each time that they test -- even if those tests fail -- they learn something.  And it is clear that ideologically they are still convinced that -- and Kim Jong-un in particular seems to be convinced that his own legitimacy is tied up with developing nuclear weapons. You pointed out the continuing tensions that exist in South Asia.  That is still a concern.  And we know that terrorist organizations would have no compunction about using a weapon of mass destruction if they got their hands on it. So we've got a lot of work to do.  I think we've built up an architecture during the course of my presidency that has made a difference, that has focused attention on some key points of vulnerability.  But we're not where we need to be yet.  And obviously we havent achieved all the goals that I set when I spoke in Prague at the beginning of my presidency.  Of course, I noted at the time that I didnt expect to be able to achieve all those goals during the course of my presidency or even in my lifetime.  And this is going to be an ongoing task, but it's one that I think we have to be paying a lot of attention to. Question:  One follow-up.  Mr. Kerry, your Secretary of State, called the North Korean nuclear program the biggest threat in the world right now -- the gravest threat.  Do you agree with that?  Do you see this nuclear program as the worst thing going on?", "filename": "26May2016PostG7ConferencePresser.txt"}, {"question": "President Obama:  Well, look, the world pays attention to the U.S. elections.  They pay more attention to our elections sometimes than we pay to theirs, because the United States is, as I've said before, at the heart of the international order.  And even those countries that are critical of us, even those countries that complain or question particular policy decisions that we make know that ultimately things dont hold together so well if the United States is not making good decisions, and count on us to provide a certain level of stability and direction in meeting global challenges. So they are paying very close attention to this election.  I think it's fair to say that they are surprised by the Republican nominee.  They are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements.  But they're rattled by him -- and for good reason -- because a lot of the proposals that he's made display either ignorance of world affairs, or a cavalier attitude, or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that is required to keep America safe and secure and prosperous, and what's required to keep the world on an even keel. With respect to the Democratic primary process, as I've said before, it's been my view to let this play out, let voters make up their minds.  And during primaries, people get a little grumpy with each other.  It's just the nature of the process.  You start off and everybody is thinking, oh, this is fine, this is going to be a friendly competition, we're going to debate ideas.  And somebody says one thing and then another person says another thing, and that felt a little sharper than I expected, and somebody's supporter pops off.  And there's a certain buildup of aggravation.  We saw that in my lengthy primary in 2008.  This is no different. But what I think is really important to remember is that, unlike what you've seen in the Democratic or in Republican primary, for the most part there's not that big a difference ideologically in terms of the issues.  Both Hillary and Bernie believe that every American should have health care.  Both of them think that we've got to make college more affordable.  Both of them believe that it's important for us to have a tax system that is fair, and that we should be closing corporate loopholes in order to pay for things like infrastructure investment and early childhood education. I mean, if you put their proposals side by side, they're all pointing in the same direction, and the differences are primarily tactical.  They have to do with how do you get some of this stuff done.  So that doesnt mean that those arent serious questions to ask and debate.  It does mean, though, that once the primary process is resolved, the ability for us to pull together around a common vision that is in sharp contrast to the vision that's being offered on the other side I think is one that will get done by the time of the convention. I would urge -- and have urged -- both sides to try to stick to the issues, because a lot of that grumpiness arises where folks feel as if we're not talking about an issue but we're talking about personalities and character.  And they're both good people.  I know them both well.  And I think that it's important for us to try to end this in a way that leaves both sides feeling proud of what they've done.  And both sides have run serious, competitive races, and debated issues in a serious way.  So I'm proud of Democrats for doing that. And, Carol, as you know -- I sure know, because I've been through this a bunch of times -- there is just the natural impulse when you're having to report every day on campaigns that every little blip, speed bump, conflict, trash-talking that takes place is elevated -- not to mention polls.  And the one thing I've learned after being around for a while is that kind of day-to-day choppiness is not indicative of longer-term trends.  I feel confident about the Democratic vision for the country, and I feel confident about our ability not just to win elections but, more importantly, to deliver on behalf of the American people and the issues they care about. Question:  Does this going until the end of July make it harder to defeat Mr. Trump? President Obama:  No.  Look, would it be nice if everybody was immediately unified and singing \"Kumbaya,\" and whoever the nominee ended up being could just take a nice two-week vacation to recharge?", "filename": "26May2016PostG7ConferencePresser.txt"}, {"question": "President.  You mentioned some tactical differences between the two Democratic candidates.  But when you hear Bernie Sanders speak, it seems like he's talking more about the issue of trustability and the need for a political revolution.  And just yesterday we saw that the State Department's inspector general put out a report about Secretary Clinton's emails, and it basically undermined some of what she said about her email practices.  I'm wondering if you think that undermines her trustworthiness with the American people, and if you agree with Bernie Sanders that she should release the transcripts of her highly paid speeches to Wall Street. President Obama:  Okay.  You know what, I take it back.  I'm not taking another question.  We're in Japan.  Don't we have something on Asia that we want to talk about?  I'll be talking about this in Washington the whole time. Look, I've already said a lot about those issues.  I think those are better directed to the campaign.  As I said before, during the course of a primary people say what they think might help them get some votes.  And once the campaign is over, then they move on, and they make an assessment in terms of how they can make sure that the vision they care most deeply about has the best chance of passing a Congress and getting signed by a President, and that Supreme Court nominees are confirmed, and all the things that make for a functioning, effective government. So I think that the noise that is going on back and forth between the candidates at this point, if you want insights into how theyre thinking about it, those should be directed to them. I'll take -- Question:  Can I have another question? President Obama:  Youve already had a question, so if I'm going to ask another question I think it's fair to give it to -- Question:  That's true. Question:  Can I ask you your thinking on the new Taliban leader and how that affects prospects for peace in the region? President Obama:  Well, as I was saying to my team, I wasnt expecting a liberal democrat to be the newly appointed leader of the Taliban.  So this continues to be an organization that sees violence as a strategy for obtaining its goals and moving its agenda forward in Afghanistan.  We have a democratically elected government in Afghanistan that we're supporting, and our goal right now is to make sure that that constitution and that democratic process is upheld -- not to mention that we're able to maintain the counterterrorism platforms that we need in that region so that al Qaeda and now ISIL are not able to take root and use that as bases to attack us in the United States. My hope -- although not my expectation -- is that there comes a point at which the Taliban recognizes that they are not going to simply be able to overrun the country and that what they need to be doing is to enter into serious reconciliation talks that are led by Afghans.  And I think if that happens, that's something that the United States and others in the world community would support.  But I am doubtful that that will be happening anytime soon.  And we'll have to wait and see how those things develop. In the short term, we anticipate that the Taliban will continue to pursue an agenda of violence and VBEDS and blowing up innocent people, and the kinds of actions that have characterized their approach over the last 15, 20 years.  But I do think that there will come a point, perhaps not this year, next year, but eventually, where there are those within the community that surrounds the Taliban, at least, that recognize their goals are best achieved by negotiations. Okay?", "filename": "26May2016PostG7ConferencePresser.txt"}, {"question": "Question:  Well, because you invited these people and they didnt show up. President Obama:  Well, I wasnt the one who held them up.  Look, I was very blunt with the Vietnamese government.  There is so much good going on in that country, and what I indicated to them is that these kinds of heavy-handed actions end up being entirely counterproductive.  And the folks we invited, including those who were there, are people that are prepared to have a constructive conversation with the government about how to advance peace and prosperity, and economic development, and environmental security in that country. And my general message, as you heard at the youth town hall meeting, is harness that talent.  Let them loose to create startups and to solve problems, and engage them.  It's the same message I had with Cuba.  It's the same message that I had in a wide range of countries where you still are seeing serious problems with human rights. The one thing I'm absolutely convinced of, though, is, is that by us engaging, by us meeting with civil society activists, it helps move the ball, it moves the needle.  It doesnt solve these problems immediately. Right now Burma/Myanmar is undergoing this democratic transformation, in part because of the process that we helped to spearhead.  They are going through revolutionary changes over the last several years.  But I guarantee you that theres still some human rights activists inside of Burma/Myanmar who are being harassed, are not able to speak freely, are not able to assemble the way we would expect them to be able to do in our own country. When I went to Cuba and I met with those dissidents, one of the individuals who was there still had cuts in his wrists from handcuffs because he had been detained just the day before.  I didnt come out of that meeting thinking the problems of human rights in Cuba are solved.  But what I'm pretty darn sure of is, is that by us meeting with them, by us shining a spotlight on their stories, by us indicating not that we were going to dictate how these societies develop, but that we do think there are certain universal values that we care deeply about and that we're going to stand with -- that that helps. And that, I think, is the biggest lesson over the course of the seven years as we've been engaging some of these countries with serious human rights problems.  The expectation that I think sometimes we've had that I've we just stand back and scold, that somehow that's going to change these internal dynamics has proven to be less effective than us engaging.  Indicating to governments that we're prepared to work with them, but that they need to make progress, and continually trying to lift up the actions of these civil society leaders in a way that provides them a little bit more space, and that space slowly grows and it ends up being a process -- and it's not always a process that travels in a straight line.  Sometimes you take two steps forward, you take a step back.  Sometimes you start seeing openings in some of these societies, and then governments get nervous and they clamp back down. But that steady pressure, combined with an appreciation of the history of these countries, combined with a willingness to listen, combined with an ability to mobilize the international community so that we're not thinking that we're doing this all by ourselves -- over time, we've seen results.  More modest than I would hope, but thats true of pretty much everything about foreign policy and domestic policy and the human condition.

How do you like my new entrance music?  Rush Limbaugh warned you about this -- second term, baby.  Were changing things around here a little bit. Actually, my advisors were a little worried about the new rap entrance music.  They are a little more traditional. They suggested that I should start with some jokes at my own expense, just take myself down a peg. I was like, guys, after four and a half years, how many pegs are there left? I want to thank the White House Correspondents. Ed, youre doing an outstanding job. We are grateful for -- the great work youve done. To all the dignitaries who are here, everybody on the dais -- I especially want to say thank you to [General] Ray Odierno, who does outstanding service on behalf of our country, and all our men and women in uniform every single day. And of course, our extraordinary First Lady, Michelle Obama. Everybody loves Michelle.  Shes on the cover of Vogue, high poll numbers. But dont worry -- I recently got my own magazine cover. Now, look, I get it. These days, I look in the mirror and I have to admit, Im not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be.  Time passes. You get a little gray. And yet, even after all this time, I still make rookie mistakes. Like, Im out in California, were at a fundraiser; were having a nice time. I happen to mention that Kamala Harris is the best-looking attorney general in the country.  As you might imagine, I got trouble when I got back home.  Who knew Eric Holder was so sensitive? And then theres the Easter Egg Roll, which is supposed to be just a nice, fun event with the kids. I go out on the basketball court, took 22 shots -- made two of them. Thats right: two hits, 20 misses. The executives at NBC asked, Whats your secret? So, yes, maybe I have lost a step. But some things are beyond my control. For example, this whole controversy about Jaz-Z going to Cuba -- its unbelievable. Ive got 99 problems and now Jay-Z is one.  Thats another rap reference, Bill.  Ill let you know. Of course, everybody has got plenty of advice. Maureen Dowd said I could solve all my problems if I were just more like Michael Douglas in The American President. And I know Michael is here tonight. Michael, whats your secret, man?  Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy?  Might that have something to do with it?  I dont know. Check in with me. Maybe its something else. Anyway, I recognize that this job can take a toll on you. I understand -- second term, you need a burst of new energy, try some new things. And my team and I talked about it. We were willing to try anything. So we borrowed one of Michelles tricks.  I thought this looked pretty good, but no bounce. I want to give a shout-out to our headliner, Conan OBrien.  I was just talking to Ed, and I understand that when the Correspondents Association was considering Conan for this gig, they were faced with that age-old dilemma: Do you offer it to him now, or wait for five years and then give it to Jimmy Fallon?  That was a little harsh. I love Conan. And of course, the White House press corps is here. I know CNN has taken some knocks lately, but the fact is I admire their commitment to cover all sides of a story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate. Some of my former advisors have switched over to the dark side. For example, David Axelrod now works for MSNBC, which is a nice change of pace since MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod. The History Channel is not here. I guess they were embarrassed about the whole Obama-is-a-devil thing.  Of course, that never kept Fox News from showing up. They actually thought the comparison was not fair -- to Satan. But the problem is, is that the media landscape is changing so rapidly. You cant keep up with it. I mean, I remember when BuzzFeed was just something I did in college around 2:00 a.m.  Its true. Recently, though, I found a new favorite source for political news -- these guys are great. I think everybody here should check it out, they tell it like it is. Its called WhiteHouse.gov.  I cannot get enough of it. The fact is I really do respect the press. I recognize that the press and I have different jobs to do. My job is to be President; your job is to keep me humble. Frankly, I think Im doing my job better. But part of the problem is everybody is so cynical. I mean, were constantly feeding cynicism, suspicion, conspiracies. You remember a few months ago, my Administration put out a photograph of me going skeet shooting at Camp David? You remember that? And quite a number of people insisted that this had been photoshopped. But tonight I have something to confess: You were right. Guys, can we show them the actual photo? We were just trying to tone it down a little bit.  That was an awesome day. There are other new players in the media landscape as well, like super PACs. Did you know that Sheldon Adelson spent 100 million dollars of his own money last year on negative ads? Youve got to really dislike me -- to spend that kind of money. I mean, thats Oprah money.  You could buy an island and call it Nobama for that kind of money.  Sheldon would have been better off offering me 100 million dollar to drop out of the race.  I probably wouldnt have taken it, but I'd have thought about it.  Michelle would have taken it.  You think Im joking? I know Republicans are still sorting out what happened in 2012, but one thing they all agree on is they need to do a better job reaching out to minorities. And look, call me self-centered, but I can think of one minority they could start with.  Hello? Think of me as a trial run, you know?  See how it goes. If they wont come to me, I will come to them. Recently, I had dinner -- its been well publicized -- I had dinner with a number of the Republican senators. And Ill admit it wasnt easy. I proposed a toast -- it died in committee. Of course, even after I've done all this, some folks still dont think I spend enough time with Congress. \"Why dont you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?\" they ask. Really?  Why dont you get a drink with Mitch McConnell?  I'm sorry. I get frustrated sometimes. I am not giving up. In fact, I'm taking my charm offensive on the road -- a Texas barbeque with Ted Cruz, a Kentucky bluegrass concert with Rand Paul, and a book-burning with Michele Bachmann. My charm offensive has helped me learn some interesting things about what's going on in Congress -- it turns out, absolutely nothing.  But the point of my charm offensive is simple: We need to make progress on some important issues. Take the sequester. Republicans fell in love with this thing, and now they can't stop talking about how much they hate it. It's like we're trapped in a Taylor Swift album. One senator who has reached across the aisle recently is Marco Rubio, but I dont know about 2016. I mean, the guy has not even finished a single term in the Senate and he thinks he's ready to be President.  Kids these days. I, on the other hand, have run my last campaign. On Thursday, as Ed mentioned, I went to the opening of the Bush Presidential Library in Dallas. It was a wonderful event, and that inspired me to get started on my own legacy, which will actually begin by building another edifice right next to the Bush Library -- can we show that, please? I'm also hard at work on plans for the Obama Library. And some have suggested that we put it in my birthplace, but I'd rather keep it in the United States.  Did anybody not see that joke coming?  Show of hands. Only Gallup? Maybe Dick Morris? Now, speaking of presidents and their legacies, I want to acknowledge a wonderful friend, Steven Spielberg, and Daniel Day-Lewis, who are here tonight.  We had a screening of their most recent film, Lincoln, which was an extraordinary film. I am a little nervous, though, about Steven's next project. I saw a behind-the-scenes look on HBO -- well, let's just check it out. Roll the tape. [tape rolls] It's a remarkable transformation. Do I really sound like that, though, honey?", "filename": "27April2013WhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinnerSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "My name is Anita Woo, your moderator this afternoon. Today we have the crme de la crme of ASEAN youth right here, gathered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in University of Malaya's Tunku Chancellor Hall. Having produced two Malaysia prime ministers, this venue is no stranger to young leaders, such as yourselves. We are here because, as youth under the age of 35, we currently represent 60 percent of the ASEAN population; and being the single largest demographic in ASEAN, we not only have an impact on our respective nations, but also across the region. From a global perspective, although ASEAN covers just three percent of land area, ASEAN is a single -- as a single identity would rank as the seventh largest economy in the world; however, each nation within ASEAN is in a different place in our journeys towards development, each journey unique. Deep poverty persists in the region, but one of the leaders tackling this issue is Indonesia's Dr. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who is currently managing director of World Bank Group. Similarly, although the record on upholding human rights and democratic governance within the region still leaves much to be desired, Aung San Suu Kyi heroic struggle and triumph proves that mountains can be moved with determination and tenacity. ASEAN young entrepreneurs don't have to look far to know that success is within their reach as AirAsia's Tan Sri Tony Fernandes carved his success from within this very region, Moreover, with a thriving scene in Southeast Asia -- creative scene -- who knows? The next Jimmy Choo could be amongst us this very moment. As our region faces the challenges inherent in a rapidly developing nation and economy, where perspectives on education, business, environment must change with the times, we should use our ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit to change how we plan to overcome these obstacles and emerge stronger than ever. Southeast Asia is one of the diversity-rich regions, home to an array of cultures and histories, and as we know, it was once even home to President Obama. The future of ASEAN will lie in its ability to not only celebrate this diversity, but to harness it as a key building block for our success. Today the President himself will be taking questions directly from those present here, as well as questions submitted to you -- submitted by you through Facebook and Twitter from around the region. Without further ado, please join me in welcoming to stage the 44th President of the United States, President Barack Obama! President Obama:   Hello, everybody. Well, good afternoon.  Selamat petang.  Please, everybody have a seat.  It is wonderful to be here and it is wonderful to see all these outstanding young people here. I want to thank, first of all, the University of Malaya for hosting us.  I want to thank the Malaysian people for making us feel so welcome.  Anita, thank you for helping to moderate. These trips are usually all business for me, but every once in a while I want to have some fun, so I try to hold an event like this where I get to hear directly from young people like you -- because I firmly believe that you will shape the future of your countries and the future of this region.  And I'm glad to see so many students who are here today, including young people from across Southeast Asia.  And I know some of you are joining us online and through social media, and youll be able to ask me questions, too. This is my fifth trip to Asia as President, and I plan to be back again later this year -- not just because I like the sights and the food, although I do, but because a few years ago I made a deliberate and strategic decision as President of the United States that America will play a larger, more comprehensive role in this regions future. I know some still ask what this strategy is all about.  So before I answer your questions, I just want to answer that one question -- why Asia is so important to America, and why Southeast Asia has been a particular focus, and finally, why I believe that young people like you have to be the ones who lead us forward. Many of you know this part of the world has special meaning for me.  I was born in Hawaii, right in the middle of the Pacific.  I lived in Indonesia as a boy.  Hey!  Theres the Indonesian contingent.   Yes, thats where theyre from.  My sister, Maya, was born in Jakarta.  Shes married to a man whose parents were born here -- my brother-in-laws father in Sandakan, and his mom in Kudat.  And my mother spent years working in the villages of Southeast Asia, helping women buy sewing machines or gain an education so that they could better earn a living. And as I mentioned last night to His Majesty the King, and the Prime Minister, Im very grateful for the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia for hosting an exhibit that showcased some of my mothers batik collection, because it meant a lot to her and it's part of the connection that I felt and I continue to feel to this region. So the Asia Pacific, with its rich cultures and beautiful traditions and vibrant society -- that's all part of who I am.  It helped shape how I see the world.  And it's also helped to shape my approach as President. And while our government, our financial centers, many of our traditions began along the Atlantic Coast, America has always been a Pacific nation, as well.  Our biggest, most populous state is on the Pacific Coast.  And for generations, waves of immigrants from all over Asia -- from different countries and races and religions -- have come to America and contributed to our success. From our earliest years, when our first President, George Washington, sent a trade mission to China, through last year, when the aircraft carrier that bears his name, the George Washington, helped with typhoon relief in the Philippines, America has always had a history with Asia.  And weve got a future with Asia.  This is the worlds fastest-growing region.  Over the next five years, nearly half of all economic growth outside the United States is projected to come from right here in Asia. That means this region is vital to creating jobs and opportunity not only for yourselves but also for the American people.  And any serious leader in America recognizes that fact. And because you're home to more than half of humanity, Asia will largely define the contours of the century ahead -- whether its going to be marked by conflict or cooperation; by human suffering or human progress.  This is why America has refocused our attention on the vast potential of the Asia Pacific region. My country has come through a decade in which we fought two wars and an economic crisis that hurt us badly -- along with countries all over the globe.  But weve now ended the war in Iraq; our war in Afghanistan will end this year.  Our businesses are steadily creating new jobs.  And weve begun addressing the challenges that have weighed down our economy for too long --  reforming our health care and financial systems, raising standards in our schools, building a clean energy economy, cutting our fiscal deficits by more than half since I took office. Though weve been busy at home, the crisis still confronts us in other parts of the world from the Middle East to Ukraine.  But I want to be very clear.  Let me be clear about this, because some people have wondered whether because of what happens in Ukraine or what happens in the Middle East, whether this will sideline our strategy -- it has not.  We are focused and were going to follow through on our interest in promoting a strong U.S.-Asia relationship. America has responsibilities all around the world, and were glad to embrace those responsibilities.  And, yes, sometimes we have a political system of our own and it can be easy to lose sight of the long view.  But we have been moving forward on our rebalance to this part of the world by opening ties of commerce and negotiating our most ambitious trade agreement; by increasing our defense and educational exchange cooperation, and modernizing our alliances; by participating fully in regional institutions like the East Asia Summit; building deeper partnerships with emerging powers like Indonesia and Vietnam. And increasingly, were building these partnerships throughout Southeast Asia.  Since President Johnsons visit here to Malaysia in 1966, theres perhaps no region on Earth that has changed so dramatically.  Old dictatorships have crumbled.  New voices have emerged.  Controlled economies have given way to free markets.  What used to be small villages, kampungs, are now gleaming skyscrapers.  The 10 nations that make up ASEAN are home to nearly one in 10 of the worlds citizens.  And when you put those countries together, youre the seventh largest economy in the world, the fourth largest market for American exports, the number-one destination for American investment in Asia. And Im proud to be the first American President to meet regularly with all 10 ASEAN leaders, and I intend to do it every year that I remain President.    By the way, I want to congratulate Malaysia on its turn to assume the chairmanship of ASEAN next year.    Malaysia plays a central role in this region that will only keep growing over time, with an ability to promote economic growth and opportunity, and be an anchor of stability and maritime security. Now, one of the things that makes this region so interesting is its diversity.  That diversity creates a unique intersection of humanity -- people from so many ethnic groups and backgrounds and religious and political beliefs.  It gives Malaysia, as one primary example, the chance to prove -- as America constantly tries to prove -- that nations are stronger and more successful when they work to uphold the civil rights and political rights and human rights of all their citizens. Thats why, over the past few years, Prime Minister Najib and I have worked to broaden and deepen the relationship between our two countries in the same spirit of berkerja sama that I think so many of you embody.    The United States remains the number-one investor in Malaysia.  Were partnering to promote security in shipping lanes.  Were making progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership to boost trade that supports good jobs and prosperity in both our countries.  Today, Im very pleased that weve forged a comprehensive partnership that lays the foundation for even closer cooperation for years to come. But our strategy is more than just security alliances or trade agreements.  Its also about building genuine relationships between the peoples of Asia and the peoples of the United States, especially young people.  We want you to be getting to know the young people of the United States and partnering well into the future in science and technology, and entrepreneurship, and education. One program that were proud of here in Malaysia is the Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Program.  Hey, there we go.  Over the past two years, nearly 200 Americans have come here, and they havent just taught English -- theyve made lifelong friendships with their students and their communities. One of these Americans, Im told, was a young woman named Kelsey, from a city in Boston -- the city of Boston.  Last year, after the Boston Marathon was attacked, she taught her students all about her hometown -- its history and its culture.  She taught them a phrase thats popular in Boston -- wicked awesome.  So that was part of the English curriculum. And so her students began to feel like a place -- that this place, Boston, that was a world away was actually something they understood and they connected to and they cared about.  They responded by writing get-well cards and sending them to hospitals where many of the victims were being treated. Partnerships like those remind us that the relationship between nations is not just defined by governments, but is defined by people -- especially the young people who will determine the future long after those of us who are currently in positions of power leave the stage.  And thats especially true in Southeast Asia, because almost two-thirds of the population in this region is under 35 years old.  This is a young part of the world. And Ive seen the hope and the energy and the optimism of your generation wherever I travel, from Rangoon to Jakarta to here in KL.  I've seen the desire for conflict resolution through diplomacy and not war.  I've seen the desire for prosperity through entrepreneurship, not corruption or cronyism.  Ive seen a longing for harmony not by holding down one segment of society but by upholding the rights of every human being, regardless of what they look like or who they love or how they pray.  And so you give me hope. Robert Kennedy once said, It is a revolutionary world that we live in, and thus it is young people who must take the lead. And I believe it is precisely because you come of age in such world with fewer walls, with instant information -- you have the world at your fingertips, and you can change it for the better.  And I believe that together we can do things that your parents, your grandparents, your great-grandparents would have never imagined. But today I am proud that were launching a new Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative to increase and enhance Americas engagement with young people across the region.  Youre part of this new effort.  Youre the next generation of leaders -- in government, in civil society, in business and the arts. Some of you have already founded non-profit organizations to promote human rights, or prevent human trafficking, or encourage religious tolerance and interfaith dialogue.  Some of you have started projects to educate young people on the environment, and engage them to protect our air and our water, and to prevent climate change.  Some of you have been building your own ASEAN-wide network of young leaders to meet challenges like youth unemployment.  And I know that some of you have been spending this weekend collaborating on solutions to these major issues. And over the next few months, across Southeast Asia, were going to find ways to listen to young people about your ideas and the partnerships we can then build together to empower your efforts, develop new exchanges, connect young leaders across Southeast Asia with young Americans. So thats part of what were starting here today.  And before I take your questions, let me just close by sharing with you the future that I want to work for in this region, about where we want Americas rebalance in the Asia Pacific to lead, about the work we can do together. I believe that together we can make the Asia Pacific more secure.  America has the strongest military in the world, but we dont seek conflict; we seek to keep the peace.  We want a future where disputes are resolved peacefully and where bigger nations dont bully smaller nations.  All nations are equal in the eyes of international law.  We want to deepen our cooperation with other nations on issues like counterterrorism and piracy, but also humanitarian aid and disaster relief -- which will help us respond quickly to catastrophes like the tsunami in Japan, or the typhoon in the Philippines.  We want to do that together. Together, we want to make the Asia Pacific more prosperous, with more commerce and shared innovation and entrepreneurship.  And we want to see broader and more inclusive development and prosperity.  Through agreements like the TPP, we want to make sure nations in the Asia Pacific can trade under rules that ensure fair access to markets, and support jobs and economic growth for everybody, and set high standards for the protection of workers and the environment. Together, we want to make the Asia Pacific -- and the world - cleaner and more secure.  The nations of this region are uniquely threatened by climate change.  No nation is immune to dangerous and disruptive weather patterns, so every nation is going to have to do its part.  And the United States is ready to do ours.  Last year, I introduced Americas first-ever Climate Action Plan to use more clean energy and less dirty energy, and cut the dangerous carbon pollution that contributes to climate change.  So we want to cooperate with countries in Southeast Asia to do the same, to combat the destruction of our forests.  We cant condemn future generations to a planet that is beyond fixing.  We can only do that together. Together, we can make this world more just.  America is the worlds oldest constitutional democracy; that means were going to stand up for democracy -- its a part of who we are.  And we do this not only because we think its right, but because its been proven to be the most stable and successful form of government.  In recent decades, many Asian nations have shown that different nations can realize the promise of self-government in their own way; they have their own path.  But we must recognize that democracies dont stop just with elections; they also depend on strong institutions and a vibrant civil society, and open political space, and tolerance of people who are different than you.  We have to create an environment where the rights of every citizen, regardless of race or gender, or religion or sexual orientation are not only protected, but respected. We want a future where nations that are pursuing reforms, like Myanmar, like Burma, consolidate their own democracy, and allow for people of different faiths and ethnicities to live together in peace.  We want to see open space for civil society in all our countries so that citizens can hold their governments accountable and improve their own communities. And we want to work together to ensure that were drawing on the potential of all our people - and that means ensuring women have full and equal access to opportunity, just like men. And to make sure we can sustain all these efforts, we want a future where were building an architecture of institutions and relationships.  For America, that always begins with our alliances, which serve as the cornerstone of our approach to the world.  But we also want to work with organizations like ASEAN and in forums like APEC and the East Asia Summit to resolve disputes and forge new partnerships.  And we want to cooperate with our old allies and our emerging partners, and with China.  We want to see a peaceful rise for China, because we think it can and should contribute to the stability and prosperity that we all seek. So thats the shared future I want to see in the Asia Pacific.  Now, America cannot impose that future.  Its one we need to build together, in partnership, with all the nations and peoples of the region, especially young people.  That vision is within our reach if were willing to work for it. Now, this world has its share of threats and challenges, and thats usually what makes the news.  We know that progress can always be reversed, and that positive change is achieved not through passion alone, but through patient and persistent effort. But weve seen things change for the better in this region and around the world because of the effort of ordinary people, together -- working together.  Its possible.  Weve seen it in the opportunity and progress thats been unleashed in this amazing part of the world. Ive only been in Malaysia for a day, but Ive already picked up a new phrase:  Malaysia boleh.    Malaysia can do it.  Now, I have to say, we have a similar saying in America:  Yes, we can.  Thats the spirit in which I hope America and all the nations of Southeast Asia can work together, and its going to depend on your generation to carry it forward.  As Presidents and Prime Ministers, they can help lay the foundation, but youve got to build the future. And now I want to hear directly from you.  I want to hear your aspirations for your own lives, your hopes for your communities and your culture, what you think we can do together in the years to come. Terima kasih banyak. Moderator Anita Woo:  Thank you very much, Mr. President.  If you may? President Obama:  Well, Im going to take the first question, and then I think Anita is going to take a question from social media.  This is tough because we have so many outstanding young people.  Ill call on this young lady right here, right in the front. Tell me your name.  If youre going to school, tell me what level youre at, what year you are in school, and where youre from. Question:   Hi, Mr. President.  Im from Cambodia, and I went to Institute of Foreign Languages at the Royal University of Phnom Penh.  And Ive got a very simple question for you.  What was your dream when you were in your 20s, and did you achieve it?  And if so, how did you achieve it? President Obama:  Well, its a short question but its not a simple one.   When I was in high school -- so, for those of you who are studying under a different system, when I was 15, 16, 17, before I went to the university -- I wasnt always the best student.  Sometimes I was enjoying life too much.  Dont clap.   This guy is the same way.   No, part of it I was rebelling, which is natural for young people that age.  I didnt know my father, and so my family life was complicated.  So I didnt always focus on my studies, and that probably carried over into the first two years of university. But around the age of 20, I began to realize that I could have an impact on the world if I applied myself more.  I became interested in social policy and government, and I decided that I wanted to work in the non-profit sector for people who are disadvantaged in the United States.  And so I was able to do that for three years after I graduated from college.  Thats how I moved to the city of Chicago.  I was hired by a group of churches to work in poor areas to help people get jobs and help improve housing and give young people more opportunity.  And that was a great experience for me, and it led me to go to law school and to practice civil rights laws, and then ultimately to run for elected office. And when I think back to my journey, my past, I think the most important thing for -- and maybe the most important thing for all the young people here -- is to realize that you really can have an impact on the world; you can achieve your dreams.  But in order to do so, you have to focus not so much on a title or how much money youre going to make, you have to focus more on what kind of influence and impact are you going to have on other peoples lives -- what good can you do in the world. Now, that may involve starting a business, but if you want to start a business you should be really excited about the product or the service that youre making.  It shouldnt just be how much money I can make -- because the business people who I meet who do amazing things, like Bill Gates, who started Microsoft -- theyre usually people who are really interested in what they do and they really think that it can make a difference in peoples lives. If you want to go into government, you shouldnt just want to be a particular government official.  You should want to go into government because you think it can help educate some children, or it can help provide jobs for people who need work. So I think the most important thing for me was when I started thinking more about other people and how I could have an impact in my larger society and community, and wasnt just thinking about myself.  Thats when I think your dreams can really take off -- because if youre only thinking about you, then your world is small; if youre thinking about others, then your world gets bigger. Thank you. Moderator Woo:  Thank you, Mr. President.  We now have a question from the social media, which weve been collecting over the week. President Obama:  Okay. Question:   The question comes from our friend from Burma, from Myanmar.  And he asks:  To Mr. President, what would be your own key words or encouragement for each of us leaders of our next generation while we are cooperating with numerous diversities such as different races, languages, beliefs and cultures not only in Myanmar, but also across ASEAN?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, its a great question.  If you look at the biggest source of conflict and war and hardship around the world, one of the most if not the most important reasons is people treating those who are not like them differently.  So in Myanmar right now, theyre going through a transition after decades of repressive government, theyre trying to open things up and make the country more democratic.  And thats a very courageous process that theyre going through. But the danger, now that theyre democratizing is that there are different ethnic groups and different religions inside of Myanmar, and if people start organizing politically around their religious identity or around their ethnic identity as opposed to organizing around principles of justice and rule of law and democracy, then you can actually start seeing conflicts inside those countries that could move Myanmar in a very bad direction  -- particularly, if youve got a Muslim minority inside of Myanmar right now that the broader population has historically looked down upon and whose rights are not fully being protected. Now, thats not unique to Myanmar.  Here in Malaysia, this is a majority Muslim country.  But then, there are times where those who are non-Muslims find themselves perhaps being disadvantaged or experiencing hostility.  In the United States, obviously historically the biggest conflicts arose around race.  And we had to fight a civil war and we had to have a civil rights movement over the course of generations until I could stand before you as a President of African descent.    But of course, the job is not done.  There is still discrimination and prejudice and ethnic conflict inside the United States that we have to be vigilant against. So my point is all of us have within us biases and prejudices of people who are not like us or were not raised in the same faith or come from a different ethnic background.  But the world is shrinking.  Its getting smaller.  You could think that way when we were all living separately in villages and tribes, and we didnt have contact with each other.  We now have the Internet and smart phones, and our cultures are all colliding.  The world has gotten smaller and no country is going to succeed if part of its population is put on the sidelines because theyre discriminated against. Malaysia wont succeed if non-Muslims dont have opportunity.    Myanmar wont succeed if the Muslim population is oppressed.  No society is going to succeed if half your population -- meaning women -- arent getting the same education and employment opportunities as men.    So I think the key point for all of you, especially as young people, is you should embrace your culture.  You should be proud of who you are and your background.  And you should appreciate the differences in language and food.  And how you worship God is going to be different, and those are things that you should be proud of.  But it shouldnt be a tool to look down on somebody else.  It shouldnt be a reason to discriminate. And you have to make sure that you are speaking out against that in your daily life, and as you emerge as leaders you should be on the side of politics that brings people together rather than drives them apart.    That is the most important thing for this generation.  And part of the way to do that is to be able to stand in other peoples shoes, see through their eyes. Almost every religion has within it the basic principle that I, as a Christian, understand from the teachings of Jesus.  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  Treat people the way you want to be treated.  And if youre not doing that and if society is not respecting that basic principle, then were going backwards instead of going forward. And this is true all around the world.  And sometimes, its among groups that those of us on the outside, we look -- they look exactly the same.  In Northern Ireland, there has been a raging conflict -- although they have finally come to arrive at peace -- because half or a portion of the population is Catholic, a portion is Protestant.  From the outside, you look -- why are they arguing?  Theyre both Irish.  They speak the same language. It seems as if theyd have nothing to argue about.  But thats been a part of Ireland that has been held back and is poor and less developed than the part of Ireland that didnt have that conflict. In Africa, you go to countries -- my fathers country of Kenya, where oftentimes youve seen tribal conflicts from the outside youd think, what are they arguing about?  This is a country that has huge potential.  They should be growing, but instead they spend all their time arguing and organizing politically only around tribe and around ethnicity.  And then, when one gets on top, theyre suspicious and theyre worried that the other might take advantage of them.  And when power shifts, then its payback.  And we see that in society after society.  The most important thing young people can do is break out of that mindset. When I was in Korea, I had a chance to -- or in Tokyo rather -- I had a chance to see an exhibit with an astronaut, a Japanese astronaut who was at the International Space Station and it was looking at the entire globe and theyre tracking now changing weather patterns in part because it gives us the ability to respond to disasters quicker.  And when you see astronauts from Japan or from the United States or from Russia or others working together, and theyre looking down at this planet from a distance you realize were all on this little rock in the middle of space and the differences that seem so important to us from a distance dissolve into nothing. And so, we have to have that same perspective -- respecting everybody, treating everybody equally under the law.  That has to be a principle that all of you uphold.  Great question.    Let me call on the -- Im going to go boy, girl, boy, girl so that everybody gets a fair chance.  Lets see, hold on.  This gentleman right here, right there with the glasses.    There you go. Question:   Hello, Mr. President. President Obama:  Hello. Question:   Im from Malaysia, currently with YES Alumni Malaysia.  Well, I have a question.  I wondered what was your first project -- community service project that you didnt like and how did the project impact your community?  Thank you so much. President Obama:  Thats a great question.  I told you that when I graduated from college, I wanted to work in poor neighborhoods.  And so, I moved to Chicago and I worked.  This community had gone through some very difficult times.  The steel plants there, the steel mills had closed.  A lot of manufacturing was moving out of America or becoming technologically obsolete, these old mills.  And so, these were areas that had been entirely dependent on steel.  And as those jobs left, the communities were being abandoned. And there was also racial change in the area.  They had been predominantly white, and then blacks and Latinos had moved in.  And there was fear among the various groups.  So they had a lot of problems.  I will tell you this, what I did was I organized a series of meetings listening to people to find out what they wanted to do something about first.  The most immediate problem they saw was there was a lot of crime that had emerged in the area, but they didnt quite know how to do anything about it.  So I organized a meeting with the police commander, so that they could file their complaints directly to the police commander and try to get more action to create more safe space in those communities for children and to end people standing on street corners, because it was depressing the whole community. Now, heres the main thing I want to tell you.  That first meeting, nobody came.  It was a complete failure and I was very depressed, because I thought, well, everybody said that they were concerned about crime, but when I organized the meeting nobody came.  And what it made me realize is, is that if you want to bring about change in a community or in a nation its not going to happen overnight.  Usually, its very hard to bring about change, because people are busy in their daily lives.  They have things to do.  One of the things I realized was I hadnt organized the meeting at the right time.  It was right around dinner time, and if people were working they were coming home and picking up their kids, and they couldnt get to the meeting fast enough. So, first of all, youve got to try to get people involved.  And a lot of people are busy in their own lives or they dont think its going to make a difference or theyre scared if theyre speaking out against authority.  And many of the problems that were facing, like trying to create jobs or better opportunity or dealing with poverty or dealing with the environment, these are problems that have been going on for decades.  And so, to think that somehow youre going to change it in a day or a week, and then if it doesnt happen you just give up, well, then you definitely wont succeed. So the most important thing that I learned as a young person trying to bring about change is you have to be persistent, and you have to get more people involved, and you have to form relationships with different groups and different organizations. And you have to listen to people about what theyre feeling and what theyre concerned about, and build trust.  And then, you have to try to find a small part of the problem and get success on that first, so that maybe from there you can start something else and make it bigger and make it bigger, until over time you are really making a difference in your community and in that problem. But you cant be impatient.  And the great thing about young people is theyre impatient.  The biggest problem with young people is theyre impatient.  Its a strength, because its what makes you want to change things.  But sometimes, you can be disappointed if change doesnt happen right away and then you just give up.  And you just have to stay with it and learn from your failures, as well as your successes. Anita. Moderator Woo:  Mr. President, thank you very much.  We have a question from our friend in Singapore.  He asks, what is the legacy you wish to leave behind? President Obama:  Ive still got two and a half years left as President, so I hope hes not rushing me.   But what is true is that as President of the United States, you have so many issues coming at you every day, but sometimes I try to step back and think about 20 years from now when I look back what will I be most proud of or what do I think will be most important in the work that Ive done. Now, my most important legacy is Malia and Sasha, who are turning out to be wonderful young people.    So your children, if youre a parent the most important legacy you have is great children -- and I have those -- who are happy and healthy, and I think theyre going to do great things.  Another important legacy is being a good husband.  So Ive tried to do that.    Thats important, because if you dont do those things well, then everything else youre going to have some problems with. But I think as President, what Ive tried to do in the United States is really focus on how do you create opportunity for all people.  And when I first came into office, we were in a huge financial crisis that had hit the entire world.  And it was the worst crisis the United States had had since the 1930s.  So the first thing I had to do was just make sure that we stop the crisis and start allowing the economy to recover.  And we've now created more than 9 million jobs and the economy is beginning to improve for a lot of people.  But what youve also seen is a trend in the United States but also around the world in which even when the economy grows, it tends to benefit a lot of people at the very top, but the vast majority of people, they don't benefit as much.  And you're starting to see bigger and bigger gaps in inequality and in wealth and in opportunity. And that's true not just in the United States, it's true in Europe; it's long been true in parts of Asia; it's been true in Latin America.  And I believe that economies work best when growth and development is broad-based, when it's shared -- when ordinary people, if they work hard and they take responsibility, they can succeed.  Not everybody is going to be rich, but everybody should be able to live a good life.  Not everybody is going to be a billionaire, but everybody should be able to have a nice home and educate their children and feel some sense of security. So that's not something that I can do by myself as President of the United States, but everything that I do -- whether it's providing more help for people to go to college, or giving early childhood education to young children because we know that the younger children get some additional schooling, especially poor children, the better off theyll do in school for all the years to come, to the work that we're trying to do in providing health care for all Americans so that they don't experience a crisis when somebody in their family gets sick -- all of those efforts are with the objective of making sure that ordinary people, if they work hard and act responsibly, they can succeed. And internationally, my main goal has been to work with other partners to promote a system of rules so that conflicts can be resolved peacefully, so that nations observe basic rules of behavior, so that whether you're a big country or a small country, you know that there are certain principles that are observed -- that might doesnt just make right, but that theres a set of ideals and theres justice both inside countries and between countries. Now, that means trying to end the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which are a threat to humanity.  And we've made progress in that front, me negotiating the reduction of our nuclear stockpiles with the Russians, and trying to resolve through diplomacy the problem that Iran has been trying to pursue nuclear weapons, and working with countries like Malaysia to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. That means working to get chemical weapons out of Syria.  It means trying to promote a just peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  It means opening up to Burma.  And I was the first President to visit there, and seeing if we could take advantage of the opportunity with Aung San Suu Kyis release to create a country that was a responsible part of the world order. Sometimes our efforts have been successful; sometimes, as I told this young man here, my efforts initially haven't been as successful and I've had to keep on trying.  And I am confident that when I'm done as President theres still going to be parts of the world that are having war, that are having conflict, that are oppressing their own people.  So I'm not going to solve all these problems.  I've got to leave some work for all of you. But what I do hope is that I will have made progress on each of those fronts -- that if when I leave I can say there are a few more countries that are democracies now and the United States helped; if there are countries where I can say -- or areas of the world where I can say we avoided conflict between two countries because we helped to mediate a dispute, I'll be proud of that.  If there are countries where a spotlight has been shined internationally on the oppression of a minority group and it has forced that country to change its practices, that will be a success. I don't consider -- I don't think I can do that by myself, of course.  I can only do that not only with the cooperation and consultation of other leaders, but it's also other citizens of the world -- all of you and people in various regions, theyve got to want more justice and more peace in order for us to achieve it. Sometimes the United States is viewed as, on the one hand, the cause of everybodys problem, or on the other hand, the United States is expected to solve everybodys problem.  And we are a big, powerful nation and we take our responsibilities very seriously, but we can only do so much.  Ultimately, the people in these countries themselves have to partner with us -- because we have problems in our own country that we have to solve.  But hopefully, I'm also lifting up certain universal principles and ideals that all of us can embrace and share. All right, its a womans turn.  It's a young womans turn. I've got to -- lets see who is back here.  No, it's a young ladys turn.  Okay, this young lady right here -- since the microphone is right there. Question:  Good afternoon, Mr. President, and welcome to Malaysia. Gathering from what youve said, I think it's a shared consensus that youth worldwide can be the catalyst, planting the seeds for an early conditioning on certain global issues here.  So my question is how exactly can America lead us youth internationally in championing such issues, for example, climate change, women empowerment, poverty eradication -- the goal being to bring the human race together?  It appears that a lot of policies have been put in place, but a lot of the policies that have been put in place by the Gen Xers, the Baby Boomers.  People like us, the Gen Ys, we don't have a say in this policy, so we are supposed to champion them, but how are we supposed to do all these things? President Obama:  I'm trying to figure out which generation I am.  You got Baby Boomers, then Gen X, and then theres a Gen Y -- we're on Y?  Is that Z, are they here yet, or -- that's next? Well, first of all, just to be very specific, as I said in my speech, part of the reason that I like to meet with young people is to get their suggestions and their ideas.  But then what we try to do is set up a process and a network of young leaders who can share ideas with each other and with us, to let us know how they think we can empower you. So coming out of this meeting, there will be mechanisms through social media and in our embassies in each of the 10 ASEAN countries where we're going to be bringing together youth leaders to talk to each other about their plans, what their priorities are, how they think the United States can be most helpful.  And we're going to take your suggestions. And lets take the example of something like climate change. The voice of young people on this issue is so important because you are the ones who are going to have to deal with the consequences of this most significantly.  I rode with Prime Minister Najib from our press conference to the new MaGIC Center that's been set up -- entrepreneurial center that came out of our global entrepreneur summit that was hosted here in Malaysia.  And on the ride over, it hadnt started raining yet, but you could tell it was going to be raining soon.  And he said that here in Malaysia youve already seen a change in weather patterns -- it used to be that the dry season and the rainy season was very clear.  Now it all just kind of is blurring together. Now, not all of that can be directly attributed precisely to climate change.  But when you look at whats been happening all across the country or all around the world, theres no doubt that weather patterns are changing.  It is getting warmer.  That is going to have impacts in terms of more flooding, more drought, displacement.  It could affect food supplies.  It could affect the incidences of diseases.  Coastal communities could be severely affected.  And what happens when humans are placed under stress is the likelihood of conflict increases. There is a theory that one of the things that happened in Syria to trigger the protests that resulted in the terrible, violent efforts to suppress them by President Assad was repeated drought in Syria that drove people off their land, so they could no longer afford to make the traditional living that they had made.  Now, whether thats true or not we dont know precisely. But what we do know is that you see in communities that are under severe weather pressure -- drought, famine, food prices increasing -- theyre more likely to be in conflict. And youre going to have to deal with this, unless we do something about it.  So the question is what can we do?  Every country should be coming up with a Climate Action Plan to try to reduce its carbon emissions.  In Southeast Asia, one of the most important issues is deforestation.  In Indonesia and Malaysia, what youve seen is huge portions of tropical forests that actually use carbon and so reduce the effects of climate change, reduce carbon being released into the atmosphere and warming the planet -- theyre just being shredded because of primarily the palm oil industry.  And there are large business interests behind that industry. Now, the question is are we going to in each of those countries say how can we help preserve these forests while using a different approach to economic development that does less to damage the atmosphere?  And that means engaging then with the various stakeholders.  Youve got to talk to the businesses involved.  Youve got to talk to the government, the communities who may be getting jobs -- because their first priority is feeding themselves, so if you just say, weve got to stop cutting down the forests, but you dont have an alternative opportunity for people then they may just ignore you.  So there are going to be all kinds of pieces just to that one part of the problem.  And each country may have a different element to it. The point, though, is that you have to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.  You have to say, this is important.  You dont have to be a climate science expert, but you can educate yourselves on the issue.  You can discuss it with your peer groups.  You can organize young people to interact with international organizations that are already dealing with this issue.  You can help to publicize it.  You can educate your parents, friends, coworkers.  And through that process, you can potentially change policy. So it may take -- it will take years.  It will not happen next week.  But our hope is that through this network that were going to be developing that we can be a partner with you in that process. So I just want to check how many -- how much time do we have here?  Who is in charge? Moderator Woo:  Weve got time, Mr. President. President Obama:  How much time? Moderator Woo:  A couple more questions. President Obama:  A couple more questions -- all right, because I just want to make sure that Im being fair here.  All right, its a guys turn.  Lets see -- all right, how about this guy, because I like his hair cut, the guy with the spiky hair right there. Question:   In your opinion, what are the top three advice to fellow Malaysians and government to become a developed country in six years time?  As this is one of countrys missions and I think its important for fellow Malaysians to contribute together in order to achieve that.  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, I had an extensive conversation with Prime Minister Najib about his development strategy.  First of all, Malaysia is now a middle-income country.  Its done much better than many other countries in per capita income and growth over the last two decades, and theres been some wise leadership that has helped to promote Malaysian exports and to help to train its people. Youve got high literacy rates, which is critically important.  Investing in people is the single most important thing in the knowledge economy.  Traditionally, wealth was defined by land and natural resources.  Today the most important resources is between our ears.  And Malaysia has made a good investment in young people.  So that continues to be I think the most important strategy for growth in the 21st century. And in the United States, my main focus is improving our education system and lifelong learning.  Because part of whats changed in the economy -- in the 20th century, you got a change at a company, you might stay there for 30 years; things didnt change that much.  Now you may be at one company and that company may be absorbed, and you might have to retrain for a new job because the thing that you were doing before has been made obsolete because of technology. So we have to keep on investing in not only elementary school and secondary school and even universities.  But in the United States, for example, we have a system of community colleges and job training where somebody whos in their 30s or even 40s or 50s can go back, get retrained, get more skills, adapt to a new industry, and then be a productive citizen.  Thats a critical investment that needs to be made. The second thing that I know Prime Minister Najib is focused on -- and this applies throughout the region -- is if you want to move to the next level of development, then you have to open up an economy to innovation and entrepreneurship.  The initial push for growth in Southeast Asia initially started with exporting raw materials, and then shifted to manufacturing and light assembly and being part of the global supply chain.  And thats all a very important ladder into development.  But now a lot of wealth is being created by new products and new ideas. And at least in the United States, for example, we dont want to just assemble the latest smartphone, we want to invent the latest smartphone.  We want to invent the apps and the content for those smartphones.  And then we have an asset that whoever is manufacturing it, some of the value is still flowing to us.  Well, what that requires then is changes in the economy to make it more open, to make it more entrepreneurial.  Some of the old systems have to be broken down. Now, different countries in ASEAN and different countries around the world are at different stages of development.  In some countries, the most important thing for development is just basic rule of law, and something that I said earlier, which is making sure that the law applies to everybody in the same way.  I believe if Malaysia is going to take that next leap, then its going to have to make sure that the economy is one where everybody has the opportunity, regardless of where they started, to succeed.    And that energy has to be unleashed. And I think Prime Minister Najib understands that. And the trade agreement that were trying to create, the TPP, part of what were trying to do is to create higher standards for labor protection, higher standards for environmental protection, more consistent protection of intellectual property -- because increasingly thats the next phase of wealth.  All those things require more transparency and more accountability and more rule of law, and I think that its entirely consistent with Malaysia moving into the next phase. Now, its hard to change old ways of doing things -- and thats true for every country.  I mean, China right now, after unprecedented growth over the last 20 years, realizes its got to change its whole strategy.  Its been so export-oriented, but now theyre starting to realize that if they want to continue to grow theyve got to develop consumer markets inside their own country. And what that means is, is that theyve got to give workers more ability to spend on consumer goods, and that they have to have a social safety net so that workers arent just saving all the time, because if they get sick they dont have any social insurance programs and they dont have any retirement groups.  And so theyre starting to make these shifts, but these are hard shifts. Even in a country thats controlled by the central party thats not democratic.  Its because certain people have gotten accustomed to and done very well with an export-driven strategy. So when you shift, theres going to be somebody who resists. Thats true in every country.  Its true in the United States.  Weve got to change how we do things.  And when you try to change, somebody somewhere is benefiting from the status quo.  Malaysia is no different.  But Im confident that you can make it happen. Ill take two more questions.  And its a young ladys turn. So, guys, you can all put down your hands.   Lets see -- this young lady with the yellow. Question:  Good morning.  Im from Indonesia. President Obama:  Apa kabar? Question:  Baik-baik saja. President Obama:  Baik. Question:  Well, okay, I have a very short question.  What does happiness mean for you? President Obama:  What does happiness mean to me? Question:  Yes. President Obama:  Wow, you guys -- thats a big, philosophical question.    I mentioned earlier my family, and it really is true that the older I get the more -- when I think about when Im on my deathbed -- I mean, I dont think about this all the time.   I dont want you to think -- Im still fairly young.  But when I think, at the end of my life and Im looking back, what will have been most important to me, I think its the time I will have spent with the people I love.  And so that makes me happy. But I also think that, as I get older, whats most important to me is feeling as if Ive been true to my beliefs and that Ive lived with some integrity.  Now, that doesnt always make you happy in the sense of youre laughing or just enjoying life -- because sometimes, being true to your beliefs is uncomfortable.  Sometimes doing things that you think are right may put you in some conflict with somebody.  Sometimes people may not appreciate it and it may be inconvenient. But I think that part of being satisfied at least with life as you get older is feeling as if you know that every day you wake up and theres certain things you believe in -- for example, respecting other people, or showing kindness to others, or trying to promote justice, or whatever it is that you think is best in you -- that at the end of each day you can say, okay, you know what, I was consistent with what I say Im about, what I say I believe in -- the image I have of myself. And when Im uncomfortable is when I think, you know, I didnt do my best today.  Maybe I didnt speak out when I should have spoken out.  Maybe I didnt work as hard on this issue as I should have worked.  Then Im tossing and turning and I dont feel good. And I think that having that kind of integrity is important -- where you can look at yourself in the mirror and you can say, okay, I am who I want -- who I say I want to be.  And nobody is perfect and everybody is going to make mistakes, but I think if you feel as if youre always striving towards your ideals, then youll feel okay at the end. Okay, last question.  And its -- lets see.  No, no, its a guys question.  Women, put down your hands.   Okay, Ill call on this gentleman here because he -- there you go, with the glasses. Question:   Good evening, Mr. President Obama.  Im from Malaysia. Im an undergrad from University of Malaya.  So my question is, in your position right now, what values that you uphold the most that you think is very important, that makes you what you are today?  And what do you wish to bring that value to the young people of today that can change the world to become a better world?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, thank you.  Im going to take another question after that, because Ive already answered this question.  Wait, wait, wait -- let me -- let me explain the -- what I think is most important is showing people respect who you disagree with, right?    And so, for example, theres a note over there -- I dont know what those young people are putting a note about -- but I think that the basic idea that if somebody is not like you, if they look differently than you, if they believe differently than you -- that you are treating them as you want to be treated.  If you are applying those ideas, I think youre going to be halfway there in terms of solving most of the worlds problems. And a lot of that is around some of the traditional divisions that we have in our society -- race, ethnicity, religion, gender.  Treat people with respect, whoever they are, and expect your governments to treat everybody with respect.    And if you do that, then youre going to be okay. All right, last question.  Young ladies -- wait, wait, wait, everybody put down their hands for a second.  Okay, now Ive heard from -- Ive had an Indonesian, a Malaysian, a Cambodian, Myanmar.  Thailand didnt get called on.  So I think -- all right, Thailand.  Where -- okay.  And the Philippines -- well, see, I cant call on everybody.   Thailand said -- they were the first ones to shout.  Go ahead, this young lady right here. Question:  Hi, President.  Very short question.  What are the things that you regret now that you have done in the past? President Obama:  What are the things that I regret?", "filename": "27April2014YoungLeadersTownHallMalaysia.txt"}, {"question": "I want to thank Michelle for the introduction and, more importantly, for the great work shes doing, what she symbolizes, and what she represents in terms of the city bouncing back.  I want to acknowledge a great friend and somebody who has been working tirelessly on behalf of this city, and hes following a family legacy of service -- your mayor, Mitch Landrieu.  Proud of him.  And his beautiful wife, Cheryl.  Senator Bill Cassidy is here.  Where did Senator Cassidy go?  There he is.  Congressman Cedric Richmond.  Wheres the Congressman?  There he is over there.  Weve got a lifelong champion of Louisiana in your former senator, Mary Landrieu in the house.  Mary! I want to acknowledge a great supporter to the efforts to recover and rebuild, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries from New York, who has traveled down here with us. To all the elected officials from Louisiana and Mississippi who are here today, thank you so much for your reception. Im here to talk about a specific recovery.  But before I begin to talk just about New Orleans, I want to talk about Americas recovery, take a little moment of presidential privilege to talk about whats been happening in our economy.  This morning, we learned that our economy grew at a stronger and more robust clip back in the spring than anybody knew at the time.  The data always lags.  We already knew that over the past five and a half years, our businesses have created 13 million new jobs.  These new numbers that came out, showing that the economy was growing at a 3.7 percent clip, means that the United States of America remains an anchor of global strength and stability in the world -- that we have recovered faster, more steadily, stronger than just about any economy after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. And its important for us to remember that strength.  Its been a volatile few weeks around the world.  And theres been a lot of reports in the news, and the stock market swinging, and worries about China and about Europe.  But the United States of America, for all the challenges that we still have, continue to have the best cards.  We just got to play them right.  Our economy has been moving, and continues to grow.  And unemployment continues to come down.  And our work is not yet done, but we have to have that sense of steadiness and vision and purpose in order to sustain this recovery so that it reaches everybody and not just some.  Its why we need to do everything we can in government to make sure our economy keeps growing.  That requires Congress to protect our momentum -- not kill it.  Congress is about to come back from a six-week recess.  The deadline to fund the government is, as always, the end of September.  And so I want everybody just to understand that Congress has about a month to pass a budget that helps our economy grow.  Otherwise, we risk shutting down the government and services that we all count on for the second time in two years.  That would not be responsible.  It does not have to happen.  Congress needs to fund America in a way that invests in our growth and our security, and not cuts us off at the knees by locking in mindless austerity or shortsighted sequester cuts to our economy or our military.  Ive said I will veto a budget like that.  I think most Americans agree weve got to invest in, rather than cut, things like military readiness, infrastructure, schools, public health, the research and development that keeps our companies on the cutting edge.  Thats what great nations do.  Thats what great nations do.  And you know, eventually, were going to do it anyway, so lets just do it without too much drama.  Lets do it without another round of threats to shut down the government.   Lets not introduce unrelated partisan issues.  Nobody gets to hold the American economy hostage over their own ideological demands.  You, the people who send us to Washington, expect better.  Am I correct?  So my message to Congress is:  Pass a budget.  Prevent a shutdown.  Dont wait until the last minute.  Dont worry our businesses or our workers by contributing unnecessarily to global uncertainty.  Get it done, and keep the United States of America the anchor of global strength that we are and always should be. Now, thats a process of national recovery that from coast to coast weve been going through.  But theres been a specific process of recovery that is perhaps unique in my lifetime, right here in the state of Louisiana, right here in New Orleans. Not long ago, our gathering here in the Lower 9 probably would have seemed unlikely.  As I was flying here today with a homegirl from Louisiana, Donna Brazile, she was -- she saved all the magazines, and she was whipping them out, and one of them was a picture of the Lower 9th right after the storm had happened.  And the notion that there would be anything left seemed unimaginable at the time. Today, this new community center stands as a symbol of the extraordinary resilience of this city, the extraordinary resilience of its people, the extraordinary resilience of the entire Gulf Coast and of the United States of America.  You are an example of what is possible when, in the face of tragedy and in the face of hardship, good people come together to lend a hand, and, brick by brick, block by block, neighborhood by neighborhood, you build a better future.  And that, more than any other reason, is why Ive come back here today -- plus, Mitch Landrieu asked me to.  Its been 10 years since Katrina hit, devastating communities in Louisiana and Mississippi, across the Gulf Coast.  In the days following its landfall, more than 1,800 of our fellow citizens -- men, women and children -- lost their lives.  Some folks in this room may have lost a loved one in that storm. Thousands of people saw their homes destroyed, livelihoods wiped out, hopes and dreams shattered.  Many scattered in exodus to cities across the country, and too many still havent returned.  Those who stayed and lived through that epic struggle still feel the trauma sometimes of what happened.  As one woman from Gentilly recently wrote me, A deep part of the whole story is the grief.  So theres grief then and theres still some grief in our hearts.   Here in New Orleans, a city that embodies a celebration of life, suddenly seemed devoid of life.  A place once defined by color and sound -- the second line down the street, the crawfish boils in backyards, the music always in the air -- suddenly it was dark and silent.  And the world watched in horror.  We saw those rising waters drown the iconic streets of New Orleans.  Families stranded on rooftops.  Bodies in the streets.  Children crying, crowded in the Superdome.  An American city dark and under water.   And this was something that was supposed to never happen here -- maybe somewhere else.  But not here, not in America.  And we came to realize that what started out as a natural disaster became a manmade disaster -- a failure of government to look out for its own citizens.  And the storm laid bare a deeper tragedy that had been brewing for decades because we came to understand that New Orleans, like so many cities and communities across the country, had for too long been plagued by structural inequalities that left too many people, especially poor people, especially people of color, without good jobs or affordable health care or decent housing.  Too many kids grew up surrounded by violent crime, cycling through substandard schools where few had a shot to break out of poverty.  And so like a body weakened already, undernourished already, when the storm hit, there was no resources to fall back on. Shortly after I visited -- shortly after the storm, I visited with folks not here because we couldnt distract local recover efforts.  Instead, I visited folks in a shelter in Houston -- many who had been displaced.  And one woman told me, We had nothing before the hurricane.  And now we have less than nothing.  We had nothing before the hurricane -- now we had less than nothing. And we acknowledge this loss, and this pain, not to dwell on the past, not to wallow in grief; we do it to fortify our commitment and to bolster our hope, to understand what it is that weve learned, and how far weve come.  Because this is a city that slowly, unmistakably, together, is moving forward.  Because the project of rebuilding here wasnt just to restore the city as it had been.  It was to build a city as it should be -- a city where everyone, no matter what they look like, how much money theyve got, where they come from, where they're born has a chance to make it. And Im here to say that on that larger project of a better, stronger, more just New Orleans, the progress that you have made is remarkable.   The progress you've made is remarkable. Thats not to say things are perfect.  Mitch would be the first one to say that.  We know that African Americans and folks in hard-hit parishes like Plaquemines and St. Bernard are less likely to feel like theyve recovered.  Certainly we know violence still scars the lives of too many youth in this city.  As hard as rebuilding levees are, as hard as -- Auditor:  [Inaudible] Mental health.  President Obama:  I agree with that.  But Ill get to that.  Thank you, maam. As hard as rebuilding levees is, as hard as rebuilding housing is, real change -- real lasting, structural change -- that's even harder.  And it takes courage to experiment with new ideas and change the old ways of doing things.  Thats hard.  Getting it right, and making sure that everybody is included and everybody has a fair shot at success -- that takes time.  That's not unique to New Orleans.  Weve got those challenges all across the country. But Im here to say, Im here to hold up a mirror and say because of you, the people of New Orleans, working together, this city is moving in the right direction.  And I have never been more confident that together we will get to where we need to go.  You inspire me. Your efforts inspire me.  And no matter how hard its been and how hard and how long the road ahead might seem, youre working and building and striving for a better tomorrow.  I see evidence of it all across this city.  And, by the way, along the way, the people of New Orleans didn't just inspire me, you inspired all of America.  Folks have been watching whats happened here, and theyve seen a reflection of the very best of the American spirit. As President, Ive been proud to be your partner.  Across the board, Ive made the recovery and rebuilding of the Gulf Coast a priority.  I made promises when I was a senator that Id help.  And Ive kept those promises. Were cutting red tape to help you build back even stronger.  Were taking the lessons weve learned here, weve applied them across the country, including places like New York and New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy. If Katrina was initially an example of what happens when government fails, the recovery has been an example of whats possible when government works together -- state and local, community -- everybody working together as true partners.  Together, weve delivered resources to help Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida rebuild schools and hospitals, roads, police and fire stations, restore historic buildings and museums.  And were building smarter, doing everything from elevating homes to retrofitting buildings to improving drainage, so that our communities are better prepared for the next storm. Working together, weve transformed education in this city.  Before the storm, New Orleans public schools were largely broken, leaving generations of low-income kids without a decent education.  Today, thanks to parents and educators, school leaders, nonprofits, were seeing real gains in achievement, with new schools, more resources to retain and develop and support great teachers and principals.  We have data that shows before the storm, the high school graduation rate was 54 percent.  Today, its up to 73 percent.  Before the storm, college enrollment was 37 percent.  Today, its almost 60 percent.  We still have a long way to go, but that is real progress.  New Orleans is coming back better and stronger.  Working together, were providing housing assistance to more families today than before the storm, with new apartments and housing vouchers.  And we will keep working until everybody who wants to come home can come home.   Together, were building a New Orleans that is as entrepreneurial as any place in the country, with a focus on expanding job opportunities and making sure that more people benefit from a growing economy here.  Were creating jobs to rebuild the citys transportation infrastructure, expanding training programs for industries like high-tech manufacturing, but also water management, because weve been building some good water management around here and we want to make sure everybody has access to those good, well-paying jobs.  Small businesses like Michelles are growing.  Its small businesses like hers that are helping to fuel 65 straight months of private sector job growth in America.  Thats the longest streak in American history. Together, were doing more to make sure that everyone in this city has access to great health care.  More folks have access to primary care at neighborhood clinics so that they can get the preventive care that they need.  Were building a brand new VA Medical Center downtown, alongside a thriving biosciences corridor thats attracting new jobs and investment.  We are working to make sure that we have additional mental health facilities across the city and across the country, and more people have access to quality, affordable health care - some of the more than 16 million Americans who have gained health insurance over the past few years. All of this progress is the result of the commitment and drive of the people of this region.  I saw that spirit today.  Mitch and I started walking around a little bit.  Such a nice day outside.  And we went to Faubourg Lafitte, we were in Trem, and we saw returning residents living in brand new homes, mixed income -- new homes near schools and clinics and parks, child care centers; more opportunities for working families.  We saw that spirit today at Willie Maes Scotch House.  After Katrina had destroyed that legendary restaurant, some of the best chefs from the country decided America could not afford to lose such an important place.  So they came down here to help -- helped rebuild.  And I just sampled some of her fried chicken.  --  It was really good.  --  Although I did get a grease spot on my suit.  --  But that's okay.  If you come to New Orleans and you don't have a grease spot somewhere -- then you didnt enjoy the city.  Just glad I didnt get it on my tie.  We all just heard that spirit of New Orleans in the remarkable young people from Roots of Music.  When the storm washed away a lot of middle school music programs, Roots of Music helped fill that gap.  And today, its building the next generation of musical talent -- the next Irma Thomas, or the next Trombone Shorty, or the next Dr. John.  Theres a Marsalis kid in here somewhere.  How you doing?   And I saw it in the wonderful young men I met earlier who are part of NOLA for Life, which is focused on reducing the number of murders in the city of New Orleans.  This is a program that works with the White Houses My Brothers Keeper initiative to make sure that all young people, and particularly our boys and young men of color who so disproportionately are impacted by crime and violence, have the opportunity to fulfill their full potential. In fact, after the storm, this city became a laboratory for urban innovation across the board.  And weve been tackling with you, as a partner, all sorts of major challenges -- fighting poverty, supporting our homeless veterans.  And as a result, New Orleans has become a model for the nation as the first city, the first major city to end veterans homelessness -- which is a remarkable achievement. Youre also becoming a model for the nation when it comes to disaster response and resilience.  We learned lessons from Katrina.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers developed stricter standards, more advanced techniques for levees.  Here in Louisiana, we built a 14 billion dollar system of improved levees and pump stations and gates -- a system that stood the test of Hurricane Isaac.  Weve revamped FEMA -- and I just have to say, by the way, theres a man named Craig Fugate who runs FEMA --and has been doing extraordinary work, and his team, all across the country, every time theres a disaster.  I love me some Craig Fugate.  --  Although it's a little disturbing -- he gets excited when there are disasters -- because he gets restless if everything is just quiet.  But under his leadership, we've revamped FEMA into a stronger, more efficient agency.  In fact, the whole federal government has gotten smarter at preventing and recovering from disasters, and serving as a better partner to local and state governments. And as Ill talk about next week, when I visit Alaska, making our communities more resilient is going to be increasingly important, because were going to see more extreme weather events as the result of climate change -- deeper droughts, deadlier wildfires, stronger storms.  Thats why, in addition to things like new and better levees, weve also been investing in restoring wetlands and other natural systems that are just as critical for storm protection.  So weve made a lot of progress over the past 10 years. Youve made a lot of progress.  That gives us hope.  But it doesnt allow for complacency.  It doesnt mean we can rest.  Our work here wont be done when almost 40 percent of children still live in poverty in this city. Thats not a finished job.  Thats not a full recovery.  Our work wont be done when a typical black household earns half the income of white households in this city.  The work is not done yet. Our work is not done when theres still too many people who have yet to find good, affordable housing, and too many people -- especially African American men -- who cant find a job.  Not when there are still too many people who havent been able to come back home; folks who, around the country, every day, live the words sung by Louis Armstrong, Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans? But the thing is, the people of New Orleans, theres something in you guys that is just irrepressible.  You guys have a way of making a way out of no way.  You know the sun comes out after every storm.  Youve got hope -- especially your young people reflect hope -- young people like Victor York-Carter.  Wheres Victor?", "filename": "27August2015OnHurricaneKatrina&10-YearAftermath.txt"}, {"question": "Everybody, please have a seat.  Nothing fills me with more hope than when I hear incredible young people like Neha and all the outstanding work that she's doing on behalf of India's youth and for representing this nation's energy and its optimism and its idealism.  She makes me very, very proud.  And I'm sure -- I think they may be her -- is that somebody related to you?", "filename": "27January2015SpeechtothePeopleofIndiainNewDelhi.txt"}, {"question": "What an extraordinary honor to be with you as we honor four Righteous individuals whose courage is measured in the lives they saved -- one child, one refugee, one comrade at a time -- and who, in so doing, helped save our world. I deliver a lot of speeches.  Very rarely am I so humbled by the eloquence that has preceded me -- not just in words, but in the acts that we commemorate today. To my dear friend, Steven Spielberg, thanks for your moving and generous words.  You spoke of the importance of finding your voice and using it for good, and I know that your work -- whether a masterpiece like Schindlers List or the stories that you have so persistently preserved through the Shoah Foundation -- is deeply personal.  Steven once said that the story of the Shoah is the story that he was born to tell, rooted in those childhood memories that he just gave you a taste of -- the relatives lost, the stories you heard from your family.  And, Steven, the whole world is grateful that you found your voice, and for the good that youve done with that voice.  It will endure for generations.  And so, on behalf of all of us, we are grateful. To Ambassador and Mrs. Dermer, to Nina Totenberg, our friends from the Israeli Embassy and Yad Vashem -- thank you so much for hosting us today.  Let me just add tonight that our thoughts are also with former Israeli President Shimon Peres.  I had the opportunity to speak with Shimon earlier this week.  I thanked him for his friendship, which has always meant so much to me, personally.  And I thanked him, once again, for the shining example of his leadership.  With his extraordinary life -- in the Haganah, and as a founding father of the State of Israel, a statesman who has never given up on peace, an embodiment of the great alliance between our two nations -- Shimon inspires us all.  And this evening we speak for all of us -- Israelis, Americans, people around the world -- in wishing him a full and speedy recovery. I also want to just note the presence of two of our outstanding senators from the great state of Tennessee.  I know that its rare where you have such a extraordinary native of the state being honored in this way, but I think its also worth noting that this represents the bipartisan and steadfast support of members of Congress for the security and prosperity of the state of Israel.  And they act on that every single day. To the survivors, families of the Righteous and those they saved, to all the distinguished guests:  We gather to honor the newest of the Righteous Among the Nations and make real the call to never forget, not just on this day of remembrance, but for all days and for all time.   And at moments like this, as I listened to the extraordinary stories of the four that we honor, memories come rushing back of the times that Ive encountered the history and the horror of the Shoah -- growing up, hearing the stories of my great uncle who helped liberate Ohrdruf, part of Buchenwald, and who returned home so shaken by the suffering that he had seen that my grandmother would tell me he did not speak to anyone for six months, just went up in his attic, couldnt fully absorb the horror that he had witnessed.  Then having the opportunity to go to Buchenwald myself with my dear friend, Elie Wiesel, and seeing the ovens, the Little Camp where he was held as a boy.  Standing with survivors in the Old Warsaw Ghetto.  And then the extraordinary honor of walking through Yad Vashem with Rabbi Lau and seeing the faces and hearing the voices of the lost, of blessed memory. And then taking my own daughters to visit the Holocaust Museum -- because our children must know this chapter of our history, and that we must never repeat it. The four lives we honor tonight make a claim on our conscience, as well as our moral imagination.  We hear their stories, and we are forced to ask ourselves, under the same circumstances, how would we act?  How would we answer Gods question, where are you?  Would we show the love of Walery and Maryla Zbijewski?  There, in Warsaw, they could have been shot for opening their home to a five-year-old girl.  Yet they cared for her like one of their own, gave her safety and shelter and moments of warmth, of family and music -- a shield from the madness outside until her mother could return. Would we have the extraordinary compassion of Lois Gunden?  She wrote that she simply hoped to add just another ray of love to the lives of these youngsters who had already endured so much.  And by housing and feeding as many Jewish children as she could, her ray of love always shone through, and still burns within the families of those she saved. Would we have the courage of Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds? I know your dad said he was just doing his job, but he went above and beyond the call of duty, and so did all those who joined in that line.  Faced with a choice of giving up his fellow soldiers or saving his own life, Roddie looked evil in the eye and dared a Nazi to shoot.  His moral compass never wavered.  He was true to his faith, and he saved some 200 Jewish American soldiers as a consequence.  Its an instructive lesson, by the way, for those of us Christians.  I cannot imagine a greater expression of Christianity than to say, I, too, am a Jew. And I ask these questions because, even as the Holocaust is unique, a crime without parallel in history, the seeds of hate that gave rise to the Shoah -- the ignorance that conspires with arrogance, the indifference that betrays compassion -- those seeds have always been with us.  They have found root across cultures, and across faiths, and across generations.  The Ambassador mentioned the story of Cain and Abel.  It's deep within us.  Too often, especially in times of change, especially in times of anxiety and uncertainty, we are too willing to give into a base desire to find someone else -- someone different -- to blame for our struggles.  Here, tonight, we must confront the reality that around the world, anti-Semitism is on the rise.  We cannot deny it.  When we see some Jews leaving major European cities -- where their families have lived for generations -- because they no longer feel safe; when Jewish centers are targeted from Mumbai to Overland Park, Kansas; when swastikas appear on college campuses -- when we see all that and more, we must not be silent.  An attack on any faith is an attack on all of our faiths.  It is an attack on that Golden Rule at the heart of so many faiths -- that we ought to do unto others as we would have done to us.  For Americans, in particular, we should understand that its an attack on our diversity, on the very idea that people of different backgrounds can live together and thrive together.  Which is why -- your father was right -- we are all Jews.  Because anti-Semitism is a distillation, an expression of an evil that runs through so much of human history, and if we do not answer that, we do not answer any other form of evil.  When any Jew anywhere is targeted just for being Jewish, we all have to respond as Roddie Edmonds did -- We are all Jews. We know that well never be able to wipe out hatred from every single mind.  We won't entirely erase the scourge of anti-Semitism.  But like the Righteous, we must do everything we can. All of us have a responsibility. Certainly government has a responsibility.  As President, Ive made sure that the United States is leading the global fight against anti-Semitism.  And its why, with Israel and countries around the world, we organized the first United Nations General Assembly meeting on anti-Semitism.  Its why weve urged other nations to dedicate a special envoy to this threat, as we have.  Its why, when a statue of an anti-Semitic leader from World War II was planned in Hungary, we led the charge to convince their government to reverse course.  This was not a side note to our relations with Hungary, this was central to maintaining a good relationship with the United States, and we let them know. Its why, when voices around the world veer from criticism of a particular Israeli policy to an unjust denial of Israels right to exist, when Israel faces terrorism, we stand up forcefully and proudly in defense of our ally, in defense of our friend, in defense of the Jewish State of Israel.  Americas commitment to Israels security remains, now and forever, unshakeable.  And I've said this before -- it would be a fundamental moral failing if America broke that bond. All nations that prize diversity and tolerance and pluralism must speak out whenever and wherever Jews and other religious minorities are attacked.  In recent years, weve seen leaders in France, Germany, and Great Britain stand strongly against anti-Semitism.  In Israel, President Rivlin has spoken eloquently about the need for tolerance and acceptance among all Israelis -- Jewish and Arab.  Meanwhile, governments have an obligation to care for the survivors of the Shoah -- because no one who endured that horror should have to scrape by in their golden years.  So, with our White House initiative, were working to improve care for Holocaust survivors in need here in the United States.  And with the compensation fund we helped create, claims are finally being paid that even more Jews deported from France during the Holocaust, including survivors here in America, can benefit from. But the task before us does not fall on government alone.  Every faith community has a responsibility.  Just as all religions speak out against those who try to twist their faith to justify terrorism and violence, just as all faiths need to speak out when interpretations of their religion veer in an ugly direction, so, too, must they speak out against those who use their faith to justify bias against Jews, or people of any faith.  We know that there were Muslims -- from Albanians to Arabs  -- who protected Jews from Nazis.  In Morocco, leaders from Muslim-majority countries around the world just held a summit on protecting religious minorities, including Jews and Christians.  His Holiness Pope Francis has spoken forcefully against anti-Semitism, saying, Every human being, as a creature of God, is our brother, regardless of his origins or religious beliefs.  These are the voices we must heed.  And anyone who claims to be a religious leader must project that vision, that truth. And finally, all of us have a responsibility to speak out, and to teach whats right to our children, and to examine our own hearts.  Thats the lesson of the Righteous we honor today -- the lesson of the Holocaust itself:   Where are you?  Who are you?", "filename": "27January2016RighteousAmongNationsAwardCeremonyAddress.txt"}, {"question": "Tonight is a particular honor for me because, lets face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father -- my grandfather -- was a cook, a domestic servant to the British. But my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place, America, that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor my grandfather signed up for duty; joined Pattons army, marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised a baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. And they, too, had big dreams for their daughter. A common dream, born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or blessed, believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined -- They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they werent rich, because in a generous America you dont have to be rich to achieve your potential. They're both passed away now. And yet, I know that on this night they look down on me with great pride. They stand here, and I stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents dreams live on in my two precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our Nation -- not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That is the true genius of America, a faith -- a faith in simple dreams, an insistence on small miracles; that we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm; that we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door; that we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will be counted -- at least most of the time. This year, in this election we are called to reaffirm our values and our commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we're measuring up to the legacy of our forbearers and the promise of future generations. And fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, I say to you tonight: We have more work to do --  more work to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant thats moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour; more to do for the father that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears, wondering how he would pay 4500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on; more to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesnt have the money to go to college. Now, dont get me wrong. The people I meet -- in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks -- they dont expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead,  and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they dont want their tax money wasted, by a welfare agency or by the Pentagon. Go in -- Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone cant teach our kids to learn; they know that parents have to teach, that children cant achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. They know those things. People dont expect -- People don't expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a slight change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice. In this election, we offer that choice. Our Party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. And that man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and service because theyve defined his life. From his heroic service to Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he's devoted himself to this country. Again and again, weve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us. John Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded; so instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he offers them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we arent held hostage to the profits of oil companies, or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the Constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties, nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world war must be an option sometimes, but it should never be the first option. You know, a while back -- awhile back I met a young man named Shamus in a V.F.W. Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid -- six two, six three, clear eyed, with an easy smile. He told me hed joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. And as I listened to him explain why hed enlisted, the absolute faith he had in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all that any of us might ever hope for in a child. But then I asked myself, \"Are we serving Shamus as well as he is serving us?\" I thought of the 900 men and women -- sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who wont be returning to their own hometowns. I thought of the families Ive met who were struggling to get by without a loved ones full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or nerves shattered, but still lacked long-term health benefits because they were Reservists. When we send our young men and women into harms way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why theyre going, to care for their families while theyre gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world. Now -- Now let me be clear. Let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued. And they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows that its not enough for just some of us to prosper -- for alongside our famous individualism, theres another ingredient in the American saga,  a belief that were all connected as one people. If there is a child on the south side of Chicago who cant read, that matters to me, even if its not my child. If there is a senior citizen somewhere who cant pay for their prescription drugs, and having to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if its not my grandparent. If theres an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It is that fundamental belief -- It is that fundamental belief: I am my brothers keeper. I am my sisters keeper that makes this country work. Its what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one American family. E pluribus unum: \"Out of many, one.\" Now even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us -- the spin masters, the negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of \"anything goes.\" Well, I say to them tonight, there is not a liberal America and a conservative America -- there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America -- theres the United States of America. The pundits, the pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But Ive got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we dont like federal agents poking around in our libraries in the red states. We coach Little League in the blue states and yes, weve got some gay friends in the red states. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and there are patriots who supported the war in Iraq. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America. In the end -- In the end -- In the end, thats what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or do we participate in a politics of hope?", "filename": "27July2004DemocraticNationalConventionKeynoteSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Why do we come to this place, to Hiroshima?", "filename": "27May2016AddressattheHiroshimaPeaceMemorial.txt"}, {"question": "Chuck Todd -- love you, brother.  Im delighted to see some of the cast members of Glee are here.  And Jimmy Kimmel, its an honor, man.  Whats so funny? My fellow Americans, we gather during a historic anniversary.  Last year at this time -- in fact, on this very weekend -- we finally delivered justice to one of the worlds most notorious individuals. [photo of Donald Trump appears onscreen] Now, this year, we gather in the midst of a heated election season.  And Axelrod tells me I should never miss a chance to reintroduce myself to the American people.  So tonight, this is how Id like to begin:  My name is Barack Obama.  My mother was born in Kansas.  My father was born in Kenya.  And I was born, of course, in Hawaii. In 2009, I took office in the face of some enormous challenges.  Now, some have said I blame too many problems on my predecessor, but lets not forget thats a practice that was initiated by George W. Bush.  Since then, Congress and I have certainly had our differences; yet, Ive tried to be civil, to not take any cheap shots.  And thats why I want to especially thank all the members who took a break from their exhausting schedule of not passing any laws to be here tonight.  Lets give them a big round of applause. Despite many obstacles, much has changed during my time in office.  Four years ago, I was locked in a brutal primary battle with Hillary Clinton.  Four years later, she wont stop drunk-texting me from Cartagena. Four years ago, I was a Washington outsider.  Four years later, Im at this dinner.  Four years ago, I looked like this.  Today, I look like this.  And four years from now, I will look like this.  Thats not even funny. Anyway, its great to be here this evening in the vast, magnificent Hilton ballroom -- or what Mitt Romney would call a little fixer-upper.  I mean, look at this party.  Weve got men in tuxes, women in gowns, fine wine, first-class entertainment.  I was just relieved to learn this was not a GSA conference.  Unbelievable.  Not even the mind reader knew what they were thinking. Of course, the White House Correspondents Dinner is known as the prom of Washington D.C. -- a term coined by political reporters who clearly never had the chance to go to an actual prom. Our chaperone for the evening is Jimmy Kimmel -- who is perfect for the job since most of tonights audience is in his key demographic -- people who fall asleep during Nightline.  Jimmy got his start years ago on The Man Show.  In Washington, thats what we call a congressional hearing on contraception. And plenty of journalists are here tonight.  I'd be remiss if I didnt congratulate the Huffington Post on their Pulitzer Prize.  You deserve it, Arianna.  There's no one else out there linking to the kinds of hard-hitting journalism that HuffPo is linking to every single day.  Give them a round of applause.  And you dont pay them -- it's a great business model. Even Sarah Palin is getting back into the game, guest hosting on The Today Show -- which reminds me of an old saying:  What's the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull?  A pit bull is delicious.  A little soy sauce. Now, I know at this point many of you are expecting me to go after my likely opponent, Newt Gingrich.  Newt, there's still time, man.  But I'm not going to do that -- I'm not going to attack any of the Republican candidates.  Take Mitt Romney -- he and I actually have a lot in common.  We both think of our wives as our better halves, and polls show, to a alarmingly insulting extent, the American people agree.  We also both have degrees from Harvard; I have one, he has two.  What a snob. Of course, we've also had our differences.  Recently, his campaign criticized me for slow jamming the news with Jimmy Fallon.  In fact, I understand Governor Romney was so incensed he asked his staff if he could get some equal time on The Merv Griffin Show.  Still, I guess Governor Romney is feeling pretty good about things because he took a few hours off the other day to see The Hunger Games -- some of you have seen it.  It's a movie about people who court wealthy sponsors and then brutally savage each other until only one contestant is left standing.  I'm sure this was a really good change of pace for him.  I have not seen The Hunger Games; not enough class warfare for me. Of course, I know everybody is predicting a nasty election, and thankfully, we've all agreed that families are off limits.  Dogs, however, are apparently fair game.  And while both campaigns have had some fun with this, the other day I saw a new ad from one of these outside groups that, frankly, I think crossed the line.  I know Governor Romney says he has no control over what his super PACs do, but can we show the ad real quick?", "filename": "28April2012WhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinnerSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Today, the Philippines welcomes President Obama and his delegation on his first state visit to the Philippines. The United States is a key ally, a strategic partner, and a reliable friend of the Philippines. With this visit, we reaffirm the deep partnership between our countries, one founded on democratic values, mutual interest in our shared history and aspirations, and one that will definitely give us the momentum to propel our peoples to even greater heights. We witnessed the most recent and tangible manifestations of this in the immediate outpouring of assistance from the government of the United States and the American people in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan (or Yolanda), and your nations clear expression of solidarity with the typhoon survivors. Mr. President, in your State of the Union address earlier this year, you spoke of how American volunteers and troops were greeted with gratitude in the affected areas.  Today, I reiterate formally the Filipino people will never forget such kindness and compassion.  On behalf of my countrymen, I thank the United States of America once more for being a true friend to our people. The friendship and partnership between our countries, however, are evident not only in times of crisis and immediate need, but also in other aspects of our relations.  Our defense alliance has been a cornerstone of peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region for more than 60 years.  And our strategic partnership spans a broad range of areas of cooperation, contributing to the growth and prosperity of both our nations, and fostering closer bonds between our peoples. As such, President Obama and I met today with the shared resolve to ensure that our deepening relations are attune to the realities and needs that have emerged in the 21st century, which affect not only our two countries, but also the entire community of nations. I thank President Obama for the U.S.s support for our governments efforts in modernizing and enhancing its defense capabilities.  The Philippines-U.S. Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement takes our security cooperation to a higher level of engagement, reaffirms our countrys commitment to mutual defense and security, and promotes regional peace and stability. Both President Obama and I shared the conviction that territorial and maritime disputes in the Asia Pacific region should be settled peacefully based on international law.  We affirm that arbitration is an open, friendly and peaceful approach to seeking a just and durable solution.  We also underscored the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Declaration of Conduct and the expeditious conclusion of a substantive and legally binding Code of Conduct in the South China Sea -- all towards fostering peace and stability in our part of the world. We, likewise, welcome the active participation of the United States in regional mechanisms such as the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit.  Typhoon Haiyan showed the entire world how vulnerable the Philippines as well as other developing countries are to natural disasters.  As such, humanitarian assistance and disaster response is an essential component of our cooperation.  As the United States and the American people have always been ready to support us in the aftermath of disasters, so too do we look forward to the continued cooperation of the United States and the rest of our partners in the international community as we undertake the task of building back the communities affected by Typhoon Haiyan. This morning we made a promising start as we discussed how our partnership can be enhanced through building climate resilient communities.  These kind of strong communities are important not only in withstanding disasters, but also in fostering inclusive growth across the entire country. President Obama and I recognize the importance of strong economic engagement for the continued growth of both the Philippines and the United States. On this note, we expressed our appreciation for the U.S.s support for our governments programs under the Partnership for Growth framework, which enhances the policy environment for economic growth through US $145 million total plan contribution from the USAID.  U.S. support is also coursed through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which supports the implementation of projects and road infrastructure, poverty reduction, and good governance, with $434 million grant from 2011 to 2016. Recently, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration reinstated the Philippines to a Category 1 status.  This will redound to mutual benefit for our countries from opening more routes for travel between the United States and the Philippines to creating more business opportunities to facilitate the increased tourism and business travel. We welcome the substantive agreement between our countries on the terms and concessions for the U.S. to support the Philippines request for the extension of special treatment for rice imports until 2017.  We also discussed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a high-standard trade agreement that will shape the global and regional economic architecture in the 21st century.  The Philippines is working to assert in how participation in TPP can be realized.  The signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro last March 27 brings a just and lasting peace within our reach  -- a peace that will serve as a strong foundation for stability, inclusivity, and progress in Mindanao.  This was born of the steadfast commitment and the hard work of our administration, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and other partners and stakeholders, the U.S. included. We thank President Obama for the United States significant assistance and support for the Philippine peace process.  Our meeting today was comprehensive, historic and significant, embodying our shared values and aspirations.  It afforded President Obama and myself the opportunity to build on the relations between our countries, and discuss our strategic mission for the future of the Philippines-United States relationship -- a relationship that is modern, mature and forward-looking, and one that allows us to surpass challenges towards the benefit of our peoples, the entire region and the world. Thank you. President Obama:  Mabuhay.  Thank you, President Aquino, for your warm welcome and your very kind words.  With the Presidents indulgence, I want to begin by saying a few words about some terrible storms and tornadoes back home in the United States.  Over the weekend, a series of storms claimed at least a dozen lives and damaged or destroyed homes and businesses and communities across multiple states, with the worst toll in Arkansas.  So I want to offer my deepest condolences to all those who lost loved ones.  I commend the heroic efforts of first responders and neighbors who rushed to help. I want everyone affected by this tragedy to know that FEMA and the federal government is on the ground and will help our fellow Americans in need, working with state and local officials.  And I want everybody to know that your country will be there to help you recover and rebuild as long as it takes. Now, this is my first visit to the Philippines as President, and Im proud to be here as we mark the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, when Americans and Filipinos fought together to liberate this nation during World War II.  All these years later, we continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder to uphold peace and security in this region and around the world.  So, Benigno, I want to thank you and the Filipino people not only for your generous hospitality today, but for a friendship that has spanned generations.  And Id add that our friendship is deeper and the United States is stronger because of the contributions and patriotism of millions of proud Filipino-Americans. As Ive made clear throughout this trip, the United States is renewing our leadership in the Asia Pacific, and our engagement is rooted in our alliances.  And that includes the Philippines, which is the oldest security treaty alliance that we have in Asia.  As a vibrant democracy, the Philippines reflects the desire of citizens in this region to live in freedom and to have their universal rights upheld.  As one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, the Philippines represents new opportunities for the trade and investment that creates jobs in both countries.  And given its strategic location, the Philippines is a vital partner on issues such as maritime security and freedom of navigation.  And let me add that the recent agreement to end the insurgency in the south gives the Philippines an historic opportunity to forge a lasting peace here at home, with greater security and prosperity for the people of that region. I was proud to welcome President Aquino to the White House two years ago, and since then weve worked to deepen our cooperation and to modernize our alliances.  Our partnership reflects an important Filipino concept -- bayanihan -- the idea that we have to work together to accomplish things that we couldnt achieve on our own.  Thats what we saw last year when Typhoon Yolanda devastated so many communities.  Our armed forces and civilians from both our countries worked as one to rescue victims and to deliver lifesaving aid.  Thats what friends do for each other.  And, Mr. President, I want to say to you and the people of the Philippines:  The United States will continue to stand with you as you recover and rebuild.  Our commitment to the Philippines will not waver.  Today, Im pleased that were beginning an important new chapter in the relationship between our countries, and it starts with our security -- with the new defense cooperation agreement that was signed today.  I want to be very clear:  The United States is not trying to reclaim old bases or build new bases.  At the invitation of the Philippines, American servicemembers will rotate through Filipino facilities.  Well train and exercise more together so that were prepared for a range of challenges, including humanitarian crises and natural disasters like Yolanda. Well work together to build the Philippines defense capabilities and to work with other nations to promote regional stability, such as in the South China Sea.  And Im looking forward to my visit with forces from both our nations tomorrow to honor their service and to look ahead to the future we can shape together. As we strengthen our bilateral security cooperation, were also working together with regional institutions like ASEAN and the East Asia Summit.  When we met in the Oval Office two years ago, Benigno and I agreed to promote a common set of rules, founded in respect for international law, that will help the Asia Pacific remain open and inclusive as the region grows and develops.  Today, we have reaffirmed the importance of resolving territorial disputes in the region peacefully, without intimidation or coercion.  And in that spirit, I told him that the United States supports his decision to pursue international arbitration concerning territorial disputes in the South China Sea.  Finally, we agreed to keep deepening our economic cooperation.  I congratulated President Aquino on the reforms that hes pursued to make the Philippines more competitive.  Through our Partnership for Growth and our Millennium Challenge Corporation compact, were going to keep working together to support these efforts so that more Filipinos can share in this nations economic progress -- because growth has to be broad-based and it has to be inclusive.  We discussed the steps that the Philippines could take to position itself for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  And I encouraged the President to seize the opportunity hes created by opening the next phase of economic reform and growth.  Today, Im announcing that my Commerce Secretary, Penny Pritzker, will lead a delegation of American business leaders to the Philippines this June to explore new opportunities.  And Id add that weve also committed to work together to address the devastating effects of climate change and to make Philippine communities less vulnerable to extreme storms like Yolanda. So, Mr. President, let me once again thank you for everything youve done to strengthen our alliance and our friendship.  Im looking forward to paying tribute to the bonds between our people at the dinner tonight and to working with you as we write the next chapter in the relationship between our two countries. Question:  Good afternoon, Your Excellencies.  President Aquino, President Obama -- welcome to the Philippines.  My questions are:  How did the United States reassure the Philippines that the U.S. is genuinely committed to countering an increasingly assertive China in the region?  Will the U.S. defend the Philippines in case the territorial dispute with China in the West Philippine Sea or the South China Sea becomes an armed conflict?  And how do you think will China react to the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement?  And what are you going to do with this that is consistent with your position to have the territorial disputes resolved in arbitration?  Thank you. President Obama:  Well, Ive been consistent throughout my travels in Asia.  We welcome Chinas peaceful rise.  We have a constructive relationship with China.  There is enormous trade, enormous business thats done between the United States and China.  There are a whole range of issues on the international stage in which cooperation between the U.S. and China are vital.  So our goal is not to counter China.  Our goal is not to contain China.  Our goal is to make sure that international rules and norms are respected, and that includes in the area of maritime disputes.  We do not have claims in this area territorially.  Were an Asia Pacific nation and our primary interest is the peaceful resolution of conflict, the freedom of navigation that allows for continued progress and prosperity.  And we dont even take a specific position on the disputes between nations.  But as a matter of international law and international norms, we dont think that coercion and intimidation is the way to manage these disputes.  And for that reason were very supportive of President Benignos approach to go before the tribunal for the law of the sea and to seek international arbitration that can resolve this in a diplomatic fashion.  With respect to the new Defense Cooperation Agreement thats been signed, the goal here is wide-ranging.  Weve had decades of alliance with the Philippines, but obviously in the 21st century we have to continue to update that.  And the goal for this agreement is to build Philippine capacity, to engage in training, to engage in coordination -- not simply to deal with issues of maritime security, but also to enhance our capabilities so that if theres a natural disaster that takes place, were able to potentially respond more quickly; if there are additional threats that may arise, that we are able to work in a cooperative fashion.  This is consistent with, for example, the agreement that we have with Australia, in Darwin.  Obviously, weve had a longstanding alliance with Australia, but we also recognize that as circumstances change, as capacities change, we have to update that alliance to meet new needs and new challenges.  And so, I think this is going to be a terrific opportunity for us to work with the Philippines to make sure that our navies, our air force are coordinated, to make sure that theres information-sharing to allow us to respond to new threats, and to work with other countries, ASEAN countries -- Australia, Japan.  My hope is, is that at some point were going to be able to work cooperatively with China as well, because our goal here is simply to make sure that everybody is operating in a peaceful, responsible fashion.  When that happens, that allows countries to focus on whats most important to people day to day, and that is prosperity, growth, jobs.  Those are the things that we as leaders should be focused on, need to be focused on.  And if we have security arrangements that avoid conflict and dispute, then were able to place our attention on where we should be focused. Mr. Carney:  The next question comes from Margaret Talev of Bloomberg. Question:  Mr. President, later today we are expecting to hear about new sanctions on people close to President Putin.  And I wanted to ask you, do you see this as a way to get to Mr. Putins personal wealth?  Do you believe that he has amassed personal wealth thats unreported?  Or is it just a means of ratcheting up pressure before a move to sectoral sanctions?  You mentioned yesterday specifically the defense industry as an area where it doesnt make sense to move without Europe moving.  I wanted to ask you, are we likely to see defense sanctions soon, banking and energy sanctions soon?  What kind of timeframe? And then, President Aquino, if I may, I also wanted to ask you about China and the new agreement.  What I wanted to ask you is what message should China take away from the U.S. and the G7s approach to Russia and Ukraine when it comes to territorial disputes?  And do you believe that the military agreement that weve just been talking about will in and of itself deter China from being aggressive territorially, or should the U.S. begin  developing military options that could be possible contingencies if you needed to go that course?  Thanks. President Obama:  Youre right, Margaret, that later today there will be an announcement made, and I can tell you that it builds on the sanctions that were already in place.  As I indicated, we saw an opportunity through the Geneva talks to move in the direction of a diplomatic resolution to the situation in Ukraine.  The G7 statement accurately points out that the government in Kyiv, the Ukrainian government, has, in fact, abided by that agreement and operated in good faith.  And we have not seen comparable efforts by the Russians.  And as a consequence, we are going to be moving forward with an expanded list of individuals and companies that will be affected by sanctions.  They remain targeted.  We will also focus on some areas of high-tech defense exports to Russia that we dont think are appropriate to be exporting in this kind of climate.  The goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin, personally.  The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that hes engaging in in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul, and to encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis in Ukraine.  There are specific steps that Russia can take.  And if it takes those steps, then you can see an election taking place in Ukraine; you can see the rights of all people inside of Ukraine respected.  The Ukrainian government has put forward credible constitutional reforms of the sort that originally Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the south and east said were part of their grievances, the failure to have their voices heard and represented.  Kyiv has responded to those.  And so theres a path here to resolve this.  But Russia has not yet chosen to move forward, and these sanctions represent the next stage in a calibrated effort to change Russias behavior.  We dont yet know whether its going to work.  And thats why the next phase if, in fact, we saw further Russian aggression towards Ukraine could be sectoral sanctions, less narrowly targeted, addressing sectors like banking or the defense industry.  So those would be more broad-based.  Those arent what well be announcing today.  Todays will be building on what weve already done and continue to be narrowly focused but will exact some additional costs on the Russians.  But we are keeping in reserve additional steps that we could take should the situation escalate further.  President Aquino:  First of all, I think China shouldnt be concerned about this agreement, especially if you look at what is being contemplated -- for instance, training for emergency disaster relief operations.  Ill give you a perfect example.  The Americans have the V-22 Osprey aircraft, which is quite a significant upgrade in capabilities in terms of reaching out to very remote areas.  We dont have a comparable aircraft.  We have smaller helicopters.  And we had 44 of our provinces devastated by Typhoon Haiyan.  Now, the training will not just train our people on how to operate this particular aircraft, but more importantly, even help the Office of Civil Defense, for instance, manage this resource in case a storm or another natural disaster of the scale that transpired does happen. Secondly, I think the statements that America has been making with regards to Ukraine is the same message that has been said to China, and I guess not only by America but so many other countries.  China itself has said repeatedly that they will and have been conforming to international law.  And the rest of the world is I think saying we are expecting you to confirm and, by actions, that which you have already been addressing by words, and not distort international law.  The Philippines has not just won through arbitration, but we did remind obviously the President and our dialogue partners that in 2002 they tried to come up with a code of conduct with regards to the South China Sea and the portion which the Philippines claims, which we call the West Philippine Sea.  And in 2012, the 10th anniversary, there had still been no progress even -- in the meeting.  So the Philippines felt it was timely to raise the matter up and to remind everybody that there is no code of conduct that binds us that sets the operational parameters for all to manage any potential conflict.  And as a result of that, there has been preparatory meetings towards the formal meeting to try and constitute a code of conduct.  So at the end of the day, we are not a threat militarily to any country.  We dont even have -- and I have said this often enough -- we dont even have presently a single fighter aircraft in our inventory.  Now, we have I think legitimate needs.  We have a 36,000 kilometer coastline.  We do have an exclusive economic zone.  We do have concerns about poaching on our waters and preserving the environment and even protecting endangered species.  So I think no country should begrudge us our rights to be able to attend to our concerns and our needs.  Question:  Good afternoon, Your Excellencies.  This question goes to President Obama, but I would also like to hear the thoughts of President Aquino.  I understand the tough balancing act that you need to do between China and your allies in Asia.  But do you believe that Chinas expansionism is a threat to regional peace and stability?  And will the Mutual Defense Treaty apply in the event that the territorial conflict with China escalates into an armed conflict? President Obama:  Well, let me repeat what I said earlier.  I think that it is good for the region and good for the world if China is successfully developing, if China is lifting more of its people out of poverty.  There are a lot of people in China, and the more theyre able to develop and provide basic needs for their people and work cooperatively with other countries in the region, thats only going to strengthen the region -- thats not going to weaken it. I do think that, as President Aquino said very persuasively, that China as a large country has already asserted that it is interested in abiding by international law.  And really, our message to China consistently on a whole range of issues is we want to be a partner with you in upholding international law.  In fact, larger countries have a greater responsibility in abiding by international norms and rules because when we move, it can worry smaller countries if we dont do it in a way thats consistent with international law. And I think that there are going to be territorial disputes around the world.  We have territorial disputes with some of our closest allies.  I suspect that there are some islands and rocks in and around Canada and the United States where there are probably still some arguments dating back to the 1800s.  But we dont go around sending ships and threatening folks.  What we do is we sit down and we have some people in a room -- its boring, its not exciting, but its usually a good way to work out these problems and work out these issues.  And I think that all the countries that Ive spoken to in the region during the course of my trip -- Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and now the Philippines -- their message has been the same everywhere I go, which is they would like to resolve these issues peacefully and diplomatically.  Thats why I think that the approach that President Aquino has been taking, putting this before international arbitration, is a sound one. And if China I think listens to its neighbors and recognizes that theres another approach to resolve these disputes, what China will find is theyve got ready and willing partners throughout the Asia Pacific region that want to work with them on trade and commerce and selling goods and buying goods.  And its inevitable that China is going to be a dominant power in this region just by sheer size.  Nobody, I think, denies that.  The question is just whether other countries in the region are also able to succeed and prosper on their own terms and tend to the various interests and needs that they and their people have as well.  And thats what we support. President Aquino:  I think from the onset, our message to China has been I think were all focused on achieving greater prosperity for all our respective peoples, and prosperity and continued prosperity does not happen in a vacuum.  There has to be stability.  And in turn, they have responded that the disputes in the South China Sea/West Philippine Sea are not the end all, be all of our relationships.  And we have had good cooperation with them on so many different fronts, and perhaps one could even argue that this is the only sore point in our relationship. Now, having said that, perhaps -- we have tried to work on that particular premise of building up our ties on different aspects where there is no conflict or very little conflict.  And in this particular instance, I have to find the way and means by which we can both achieve our respective goals, which I believe are not -- or should not be mutually exclusive, but rather should be inclusive if at the end of the day, we do want to strive for the prosperity of our respective peoples. That I think has to be the primordial concern, rather than disputes on a few rocks that are not possible to be inhabited.  And I think in due time, given the fact that theres so much commerce that traverses this particular -- both in the maritime and the air domain -- China, which has achieved its goals of improving the life of its people, will see the soundness of this proposal and perhaps will act more, shall we say, consistently and actively towards achieving that stability for all.  That is our hope.  Question:  Thank you to both Presidents.  President Aquino, as a journalist, Id like to ask you why 26 journalists have been killed since you took office.  And I understand that there have only been suspects arrested in six of those cases.  What are you doing to fix that? President Obama, as you grappled here with all these national security challenges, I have two questions.  One, back home weve learned that 40 military veterans died while they were waiting for health care, a very tragic situation.  I know you dont run the Phoenix Office of Veterans Affairs, but as Commander-in-Chief, what specifically will you pledge to fix that?  And, secondly, more broadly -- big picture -- as you end this trip, I dont think I have to remind you there have been a lot of unflattering portraits of your foreign policy right now.  And rather than get into all the details or red lines, et cetera, Id like to give you a chance to lay out what your vision is more than five years into office, what you think the Obama doctrine is in terms of what your guiding principle is on all of these crises and how you answer those critics who say they think the doctrine is weakness.  President Obama:  Well, Ed, I doubt that Im going to have time to lay out my entire foreign policy doctrine.  And there are actually some complimentary pieces as well about my foreign policy, but Im not sure you ran them.  Heres I think the general takeaway from this trip.  Our alliances in the Asia Pacific have never been stronger; I can say that unequivocally.  Our relationship with ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia have never been stronger.  I dont think thats subject to dispute.  As recently as a decade ago, there were great tensions between us and Malaysia, for example.  And I think you just witnessed the incredible warmth and strength of the relationship between those two countries.  Were here in the Philippines signing a defense agreement.  Ten years ago, fifteen years ago there was enormous tensions around our defense relationship with the Philippines.  And so its hard to square whatever it is that the critics are saying with facts on the ground, events on the ground here in the Asia Pacific region.  Typically, criticism of our foreign policy has been directed at the failure to use military force.  And the question I think I would have is, why is it that everybody is so eager to use military force after weve just gone through a decade of war at enormous costs to our troops and to our budget?  And what is it exactly that these critics think would have been accomplished? My job as Commander-in-Chief is to deploy military force as a last resort, and to deploy it wisely.  And, frankly, most of the foreign policy commentators that have questioned our policies would go headlong into a bunch of military adventures that the American people had no interest in participating in and would not advance our core security interests.  So if you look at Syria, for example, our interest is in helping the Syrian people, but nobody suggests that us being involved in a land war in Syria would necessarily accomplish this goal.  And I would note that those who criticize our foreign policy with respect to Syria, they themselves say, no, no, no, we dont mean sending in troops.  Well, what do you mean?  Well, you should be assisting the opposition -- well, were assisting the opposition.  What else do you mean?  Well, perhaps you should have taken a strike in Syria to get chemical weapons out of Syria.  Well, it turns out were getting chemical weapons out of Syria without having initiated a strike.  So what else are you talking about?  And at that point it kind of trails off. In Ukraine, what weve done is mobilize the international community.  Russia has never been more isolated.  A country that used to be clearly in its orbit now is looking much more towards Europe and the West, because theyve seen that the arrangements that have existed for the last 20 years werent working for them.  And Russia is having to engage in activities that have been rejected uniformly around the world.  And weve been able to mobilize the international community to not only put diplomatic pressure on Russia, but also weve been able to organize European countries who many were skeptical would do anything to work with us in applying sanctions to Russia.  Well, what else should we be doing?  Well, we shouldnt be putting troops in, the critics will say.  Thats not what we mean.  Well, okay, what are you saying?  Well, we should be arming the Ukrainians more.  Do people actually think that somehow us sending some additional arms into Ukraine could potentially deter the Russian army?  Or are we more likely to deter them by applying the sort of international pressure, diplomatic pressure and economic pressure that were applying? The point is that for some reason many who were proponents of what I consider to be a disastrous decision to go into Iraq havent really learned the lesson of the last decade, and they keep on just playing the same note over and over again.  Why?", "filename": "28April2014JointPresserwithPhilippinePresidentBenignoAquinoIII.txt"}, {"question": "Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time? I -- I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change. The truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives -- on health care and education and the economy, Senator McCain has been anything but independent. He says that our economy has made great progress under this President. He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. And when one of his chief advisors -- the man who wrote his economic plan -- was talking about the anxieties that Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession, and that we've become -- and I quote -- \"a nation of whiners.\" A nation of whiners. Tell that to the proud autoworkers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up everyday and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made. Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burden silently as they watch their loved ones leave for there third or fourth or fifth tour of duty. These are not whiners. They work hard and they give back and they keep going without complaint. These are the Americans I know. Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans. I just think he doesn't know. Why else would he define \"middle-class\" as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement? It's not because John McCain doesn't care; it's because John McCain doesn't get it. For over two decades -- For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy: Give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. In Washington, they call this the \"Ownership Society,\" but what it really means is that you're on your own. Out of work? Tough luck, you're on your own. No health care? The market will fix it. You're on your own. Born into poverty? Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, even if you don't have boots. You are on your own. Well, it's time for them to own their failure. It's time for us to change America. And that's why I'm running for President of the United States. You see -- You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country. We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage, whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma. We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President, when the average American family saw its income go up 7,500 dollars instead of go down 2,000 dollars, like it has under George Bush. We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off and look after a sick kid without losing her job, an economy that honors the dignity of work. The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great, a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight. Because, in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the G.I. Bill. In the face of that young student, who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree, who once turned to food stamps, but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. When I -- When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed. And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business or making her way in the world, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman. She's the one who taught me about hard work. She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life. She poured everything she had into me. And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight and that tonight is her night, as well. Now -- Now , I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine. These are my heroes; theirs are the stories that shaped my life. And it is on behalf of them that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States. What -- What is that American promise? It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have obligations to treat each other with dignity and respect. It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, to look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road. Ours -- Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves: protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools, and new roads, and science, and technology. Our government should work for us, not against us. It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work. That's the promise of America, the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation, the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper, I am my sister's keeper. That's the promise we need to keep. That's the change we need right now. So -- So let me -- let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President. Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it. You know, unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America. I'll eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow. I will -- listen now -- I will cut taxes -- cut taxes -- for 95 percent of all working families, because, in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class. And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: In 10 years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East. We will do this. Washington -- Washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years. And, by the way, John McCain has been there for 26 of them. And in that time, he has said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investment in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels. And today, we import triple the amount of oil than we had on the day that Senator McCain took office. Now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution, not even close. As President -- As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars. And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy -- wind power, and solar power, and the next generation of biofuels -- an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced. America, now is not the time for small plans. Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy. You know, Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education. And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance. I'll invest in early childhood education. I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries, and give them more support. And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability. And we will keep our promise to every young American: If you commit to serving your community or our country, we will make sure you can afford a college education. Now -- Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American. If you have health care -- If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums. If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves. And -- And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most. Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their job and caring for a sick child or an ailing parent. Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses, and the time to protect Social Security for future generations. And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have the exact same opportunities as your sons. Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime: by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow. But I will also go through the federal budget line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less, because we cannot meet 21st-century challenges with a 20th-century bureaucracy. And, Democrats -- Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money. It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F. Kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength. Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient. Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair. But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents, that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework, that fathers must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children. Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility, that's the essence of America's promise. And just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad. If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have. For -- For while -- while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats that we face. When John McCain said we could just muddle through in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights. You know, John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the gates of Hell, but he won't even follow him to the cave where he lives. And today -- today, as my call for a timeframe to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has 79 billion dollars in surplus while we are wallowing in deficit, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war. That's not the judgment we need; that won't keep America safe. We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past. You don't defeat -- You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in 80 countries by occupying Iraq. You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington. You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances. If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice, but that is not the change that America needs. We are the Party of Roosevelt. We are the Party of Kennedy. So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country. Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe. The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, have built, and we are here to restore that legacy. As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home. I will end this war in Iraq responsibly and finish the fight against Al Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts, but I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression. I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation, poverty and genocide, climate change and disease. And I will restore our moral standing so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future. These -- These are the policies I will pursue. And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain. But what I will not do is suggest that the senator takes his positions for political purposes, because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and each other's patriotism. The times are too serious; the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook. So let us agree that patriotism has no Party. I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain. The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and independents, but they have fought together, and bled together, and some died together under the same proud flag. They have not served a red America or a blue America; they have served the United States of America. So I've got news for you, John McCain: We all put our country first. America, our work will not be easy. The challenges we face require tough choices. And Democrats, as well as Republicans, will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past, for part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits. What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose, and that's what we have to restore. We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country. The -- The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals. I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in a hospital and to live lives free of discrimination. You know, passions may fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers. But this, too, is part of America's promise, the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort. I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk. They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer, and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values. And that's to be expected, because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare voters. If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from. You make a big election about small things. And you know what?", "filename": "28August2008DNCPresidentialNominationAcceptanceSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "In 1963, almost 200 years after those words were set to paper, a full century after a great war was fought and emancipation proclaimed, that promise -- those truths -- remained unmet.  And so they came by the thousands from every corner of our country, men and women, young and old, blacks who longed for freedom and whites who could no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of others. Across the land, congregations sent them off with food and with prayer.  In the middle of the night, entire blocks of Harlem came out to wish them well.  With the few dollars they scrimped from their labor, some bought tickets and boarded buses, even if they couldnt always sit where they wanted to sit.  Those with less money hitchhiked or walked.  They were seamstresses and steelworkers, students and teachers, maids and Pullman porters.  They shared simple meals and bunked together on floors.  And then, on a hot summer day, they assembled here, in our nations capital, under the shadow of the Great Emancipator -- to offer testimony of injustice, to petition their government for redress, and to awaken Americas long-slumbering conscience. We rightly and best remember Dr. Kings soaring oratory that day, how he gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions; how he offered a salvation path for oppressed and oppressors alike.  His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time. But we would do well to recall that day itself also belonged to those ordinary people whose names never appeared in the history books, never got on TV.  Many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters.  They lived in towns where they couldnt vote and cities where their votes didnt matter.  They were couples in love who couldnt marry, soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home.  They had seen loved ones beaten, and children fire-hosed, and they had every reason to lash out in anger, or resign themselves to a bitter fate. And yet they chose a different path.  In the face of hatred, they prayed for their tormentors.  In the face of violence, they stood up and sat in, with the moral force of nonviolence.  Willingly, they went to jail to protest unjust laws, their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs.  A lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that God grants us.  They had learned through hard experience what Frederick Douglass once taught -- that freedom is not given, it must be won, through struggle and discipline, persistence and faith. That was the spirit they brought here that day.  That was the spirit young people like John Lewis brought to that day.  That was the spirit that they carried with them, like a torch, back to their cities and their neighborhoods.  That steady flame of conscience and courage that would sustain them through the campaigns to come -- through boycotts and voter registration drives and smaller marches far from the spotlight; through the loss of four little girls in Birmingham, and the carnage of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and the agony of Dallas and California and Memphis.  Through setbacks and heartbreaks and gnawing doubt, that flame of justice flickered; it never died. And because they kept marching, America changed.  Because they marched, a Civil Rights law was passed.  Because they marched, a Voting Rights law was signed.  Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody elses laundry or shining somebody elses shoes.  Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and, yes, eventually, the White House changed. Because they marched, America became more free and more fair -- not just for African Americans, but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans; for Catholics, Jews, and Muslims; for gays, for Americans with a disability.  America changed for you and for me.  and the entire world drew strength from that example, whether the young people who watched from the other side of an Iron Curtain and would eventually tear down that wall, or the young people inside South Africa who would eventually end the scourge of apartheid. Those are the victories they won, with iron wills and hope in their hearts.  That is the transformation that they wrought, with each step of their well-worn shoes.  Thats the debt that I and millions of Americans owe those maids, those laborers, those porters, those secretaries; folks who could have run a company maybe if they had ever had a chance; those white students who put themselves in harms way, even though they didn't have; those Japanese Americans who recalled their own internment; those Jewish Americans who had survived the Holocaust; people who could have given up and given in, but kept on keeping on, knowing that weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning. On the battlefield of justice, men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all in ways that our children now take for granted, as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together, and fight alongside one another, and love one another, and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on Earth. To dismiss the magnitude of this progress -- to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed -- that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years. Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, Martin Luther King Jr. -- they did not die in vain.  Their victory was great.  But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete.  The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesnt bend on its own.  To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency.  Whether by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote, or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all, and the criminal justice system is not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails, it requires vigilance. And we'll suffer the occasional setback.  But we will win these fights.  This country has changed too much.  People of goodwill, regardless of party, are too plentiful for those with ill will to change historys currents. In some ways, though, the securing of civil rights, voting rights, the eradication of legalized discrimination -- the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the March.  For the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract ideal.  They were there seeking jobs as well as justice -- not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity. For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he cant afford the meal?", "filename": "28August2013LetFreedomRingCeremonySpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Second, in Iraq, our dedicated pilots and crews continue to carry out the targeted strikes that I authorized to protect Americans there and to address the humanitarian situation on the ground.  As Commander-in-Chief, I will always do what is necessary to protect the American people and defend against evolving threats to our homeland.  Because of our strikes, the terrorists of ISIL are losing arms and equipment.  In some areas, Iraqi government and Kurdish forces have begun to push them back.  And we continue to be proud and grateful to our extraordinary personnel serving in this mission. Now, ISIL poses an immediate threat to the people of Iraq and to people throughout the region.  And thats why our military action in Iraq has to be part of a broader, comprehensive strategy to protect our people and to support our partners who are taking the fight to ISIL.  And that starts with Iraqs leaders building on the progress that theyve made so far and forming an inclusive government that will unite their country and strengthen their security forces to confront ISIL. Any successful strategy, though, also needs strong regional partners.  Im encouraged so far that countries in the region -- countries that dont always agree on many things -- increasingly recognize the primacy of the threat that ISIL poses to all of them.  And Ive asked Secretary Kerry to travel to the region to continue to build the coalition thats needed to meet this threat.  As Ive said, rooting out a cancer like ISIL will not be quick or easy, but Im confident that we can -- and we will -- working closely with our allies and our partners.  For our part, Ive directed Secretary Hagel and our Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a range of options.  Ill be meeting with my National Security Council again this evening as we continue to develop that strategy.  And Ive been consulting with members of Congress and Ill continue to do so in the days ahead. Finally, I just spoke with Chancellor Merkel of Germany on the situation in Ukraine.  We agree -- if there was ever any doubt -- that Russia is responsible for the violence in eastern Ukraine.  The violence is encouraged by Russia.  The separatists are trained by Russia.  They are armed by Russia.  They are funded by Russia.  Russia has deliberately and repeatedly violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.  And the new images of Russian forces inside Ukraine make that plain for the world to see.  This comes as Ukrainian forces are making progress against the separatists. As a result of the actions Russia has already taken, and the major sanctions weve imposed with our European and international partners, Russia is already more isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War.  Capital is fleeing.  Investors are increasingly staying out.  Its economy is in decline.  And this ongoing Russian incursion into Ukraine will only bring more costs and consequences for Russia.  Next week, Ill be in Europe to coordinate with our closest allies and partners.  In Estonia, I will reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the defense of our NATO allies.  At the NATO Summit in the United Kingdom, well focus on the additional steps we can take to ensure the Alliance remains prepared for any challenge.  Our meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Commission will be another opportunity for our alliance to continue our partnership with Ukraine.  And I look forward to reaffirming the unwavering commitment of the United States to Ukraine and its people when I welcome President Poroshenko to the White House next month.   So with that, Im going to take a few questions.  And Im going to start with somebody who I guess is now a big cheese -- hes moved on.  But I understand this is going to be his last chance to ask me a question in the press room.  So I want to congratulate Chuck Todd and give him first dibs. Q:  Im glad you said in the press room.  Let me start with Syria.  The decision that you have to make between -- first of all, is it a if or when situation about going after ISIL in Syria?  Can you defeat ISIL or ISIS without going after them in Syria?  And then how do you prioritize?  You have said that Assad has lost legitimacy to lead.  Defeating ISIS could help Assad keep power.  Talk about how you prioritize those two pieces of your foreign policy. President Obama: Well, first of all, I want to make sure everybody is clear on what were doing now, because it is limited.  Our focus right now is to protect American personnel on the ground in Iraq; to protect our embassy, to protect our consulates, to make sure that critical infrastructure that could adversely affect our personnel is protected.  Where we see an opportunity that allows us with very modest risk to help the humanitarian situation there as we did in Sinjar Mountain, we will take those opportunities after having consulted with Congress.  But our core priority right now is just to make sure that our folks are safe and to do an effective assessment of Iraqi and Kurdish capabilities.   As I said I think in the last press conference, in order for us to be successful, weve got to have an Iraqi government that is unified and inclusive.  So we are continuing to push them to get that job done.  As soon as we have an Iraqi government in place, the likelihood of the Iraqi security forces being more effective in taking the fight to ISIL significantly increases.  And the options that Im asking for from the Joint Chiefs focuses primarily on making sure that ISIL is not overrunning Iraq.  What is true, though, is that the violence thats been taking place in Syria has obviously given ISIL a safe haven there in ungoverned spaces.  And in order for us to degrade ISIL over the long term, were going to have to build a regional strategy.  Now, were not going to do that alone.  Were going to have to do that with other partners, and particularly Sunni partners, because part of the goal here is to make sure that Sunnis both in Syria and in Iraq feel as if theyve got an investment in a government that actually functions, a government that can protect them, a government that makes sure that their families are safe from the barbaric acts that weve seen in ISIL.  And right now, those structures are not in place.   And thats why the issue with respect to Syria is not simply a military issue, its also a political issue.  Its also an issue that involves all the Sunni states in the region and Sunni leadership recognizing that this cancer that has developed is one that they have to be just as invested in defeating as we are.   And so to cut to the chase in terms of what may be your specific concerns, Chuck, my priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that ISIL made in Iraq are rolled back, and that Iraq has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself.   But when we look at a broader strategy that is consistent with what I said at West Point, thats consistent with what I said at the National Defense College, clearly ISIL has come to represent the very worst elements in the region that we have to deal with collectively.  And thats going to be a long-term project.  Its going to require us to stabilize Syria in some fashion, and stabilizing Syria in some fashion means that weve got to get moderate Sunnis who are able to govern and offer a real alternative and competition to what ISIL has been doing in some of these spaces.   Now, the last point with respect to Assad, its not just my opinion -- I think it would be international opinion -- that Assad has lost legitimacy in terms of dropping barrel bombs on innocent families and killing tens of thousands of people.  And right now, what were seeing is the areas that ISIL is occupying are not controlled by Assad anyway.  And, frankly, Assad doesnt seem to have the capability or reach to get into those areas.  So I dont think this is a situation where we have to choose between Assad or the kinds of people who carry on the incredible violence that weve been seeing there.  We will continue to support a moderate opposition inside of Syria, in part because we have to give people inside of Syria a choice other than ISIL or Assad.   And I dont see any scenario in which Assad somehow is able to bring peace and stability to a region that is majority Sunni and has not so far shown any willingness to share power with them or in any kind of significant way deal with the longstanding grievances that they have there.   Q:  Do you need Congresss approval to go into Syria? President Obama:  I have consulted with Congress throughout this process.  I am confident that as Commander-in-Chief I have the authorities to engage in the acts that we are conducting currently.  As our strategy develops, we will continue to consult with Congress.  And I do think that it will be important for Congress to weigh in, or that our consultations with Congress continue to develop so that the American people are part of the debate.  But I dont want to put the cart before the horse.  We dont have a strategy yet.  I think what Ive seen in some of the news reports suggests that folks are getting a little further ahead of where were at than we currently are.  And I think thats not just my assessment, but the assessment of our military as well.  We need to make sure that weve got clear plans, that were developing them.  At that point, I will consult with Congress and make sure that their voices are heard.  But theres no point in me asking for action on the part of Congress before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done.  Colleen McCain Nelson. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Do you consider todays escalation in Ukraine an invasion?  And when you talk about additional costs to Russia, are you ready at this point to impose broader economic sanctions?  Or are you considering other responses that go beyond sanctions? President Obama:  I consider the actions that weve seen in the last week a continuation of whats been taking place for months now.  As I said in my opening statement, there is no doubt that this is not a homegrown, indigenous uprising in eastern Ukraine.  The separatists are backed, trained, armed, financed by Russia.  Throughout this process, weve seen deep Russian involvement in everything that theyve done.   I think in part because of the progress that you had seen by the Ukrainians around Donetsk and Luhansk, Russia determined that it had to be a little more overt in what it had already been doing.  But its not really a shift.  What we have seen, though, is that President Putin and Russia have repeatedly passed by potential off-ramps to resolve this diplomatically.  And so in our consultations with our European allies and partners, my expectation is, is that we will take additional steps primarily because we have not seen any meaningful action on the part of Russia to actually try to resolve this in diplomatic fashion.  And I think that the sanctions that weve already applied have been effective.  Our intelligence shows that the Russians know theyve been effective, even though it may not appear on Russian television.  And I think there are ways for us to deepen or expand the scope of some of that work.   But ultimately, I think whats important to recognize is the degree to which Russian decision-making is isolating Russia.  They're doing this to themselves.  And what Ive been encouraged by is the degree to which our European partners recognize even though they are bearing a cost in implementing these sanctions, they understand that a broader principle is at stake.  And so I look forward to the consultations that well have when I see them next week.   Zeke Miller.  Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Last year, you said that you believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress.  In response to Chucks question you said you dont have a strategy yet, but youll reconsider that going forward.  But why didnt you go to Congress before this current round of strikes in Iraq?  Do you not believe that thats the case anymore, what you said last year?  And throughout your career youve also said that -- you raised concerns with the expansion of powers of the executive.  Are you concerned that your recent actions, unilaterally, had maybe -- have cut against that? President Obama:  No.  And heres why:  It is not just part of my responsibility, but it is a sacred duty for me as Commander-in-Chief to protect the American people.  And that requires me to act fast, based on information I receive, if an embassy of ours or a consulate of ours is being threatened.  The decisions I made were based on very concrete assessments about the possibility that Erbil might be overrun in the Kurdish region and that our consulate could be in danger.  And I cant afford to wait in order to make sure that those folks are protected. But throughout this process, weve consulted closely with Congress, and the feedback Ive gotten from Congress is, is that were doing the right thing.  Now, as we go forward -- as Ive described to Chuck -- and look at a broader regional strategy with an international coalition and partners to systematically degrade ISILs capacity to engage in the terrible violence and disruptions that theyve been engaging in not just in Syria, not just in Iraq, but potentially elsewhere if we dont nip this at the bud, then those consultations with Congress for something that is longer term I think become more relevant. And it is my intention that Congress has to have some buy-in as representatives of the American people.  And, by the way, the American people need to hear what that strategy is.  But as I said to Chuck, I dont want to put the cart before the horse.  And in some of the media reports the suggestion seems to have been that were about to go full scale on an elaborate strategy for defeating ISIL, and the suggestion, I guess, has been that well start moving forward imminently and somehow Congress -- still out of town -- is going to be left in the dark.  Thats not whats going to happen. We are going to continue to focus on protecting the American people.  Were going to continue, where we can, to engage in the sort of humanitarian acts that saved so many folks who were trapped on a mountain.  We are going to work politically and diplomatically with folks in the region.  And were going to cobble together the kind of coalition that we need for a long-term strategy as soon as we are able to fit together the military, political and economic components of that strategy.  There will be a military aspect to that, and its going to be important for Congress to know what that is, in part because it may cost some money. Ill just take a couple more.  Yes. Q:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Do you regret not moving on ISIS earlier?  There are some reports indicating that most of the weapons, the U.S. weapons that they have, they got it or they acquired it after the fall of Mosul.  And also, the Iraqi President said today that the Iraqi forces are in no position to stand up to ISIS.  What makes you think that forming a new government will change the situation? President Obama:  Well, once ISIL got into Mosul that posed a big problem, because theres no doubt that they were able to capture some weapons and resources that they then used to finance additional operations. And at that stage, we immediately contacted the Iraqi government.  Keep in mind we had been in communications with the Iraqi government for more than a year indicating that we saw significant problems in the Sunni areas.  Prime Minister Maliki was not as responsive perhaps as we would have liked to some of the underlying political grievances that existed at the time. There is no doubt that in order for Iraq security forces to be successful, they're going to need help.  They're going to need help from us.  They're going to need help from our international partners.  They're going to need additional training.  They're going to need additional equipment.  And we are going to be prepared to offer that support.  There may be a role for an international coalition providing additional air support for their operations.  But the reason its so important that an Iraqi government be in place is this is not simply a military problem.  The problem we have had consistently is a Sunni population that feels alienated from Baghdad and does not feel invested in whats happening, and does not feel as if anybody is looking out for them. If we can get a government in place that provides Sunnis some hope that a national government serves their interest, if they can regain some confidence and trust that it will follow through on commitments that were made way back in 2006 and 2007 and 2008 and earlier about how you arrive at, for example, de-Baathification laws and give people opportunities so they're not locked out of government positions -- if those things are followed through on, and we are able to combine it with a sound military strategy, then I think we can be successful.  If we can't, then the idea that the United States or any outside power would perpetually defeat ISIS I think is unrealistic.  As Ive said before -- I think I said in the previous press conference -- our military is the best in the world.  We can route ISIS on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily.  But then as soon as we leave, the same problems come back again.  So weve got to make sure that Iraqis understand in the end they're going to be responsible for their own security.  And part of that is going to be the capacity for them to make compromises. It also means that states in the region stop being ambivalent about these extremist groups.  The truth is that weve had state actors who at times have thought that the way to advance their interests is, well, financing some of these groups as proxies is not such a bad strategy.  And part of our message to the entire region is this should be a wake-up call to Sunni,to Shia -- to everybody -- that a group like ISIS is beyond the pale; that they have no vision or ideology beyond violence and chaos and the slaughter of innocent people.  And as a consequence, weve got to all join together -- even if we have differences on a range of political issues -- to make sure that theyre rooted out. Last question. Q:  Mr. President, despite all of the actions the West has taken to get Russia to pull back from Ukraine, Russia seems intent on taking one step after another -- convoys, transports of arms.  At what point do sanctions no longer work?  Would you envisage the possibility of a necessity of military action to get Russia to pull back from Ukraine?  President Obama:  We are not taking military action to solve the Ukrainian problem.  What were doing is to mobilize the international community to apply pressure on Russia.  But I think it is very important to recognize that a military solution to this problem is not going to be forthcoming.  Now, the fact that Russia has taken these actions in violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Ukrainians has resulted, I believe, in a weakening of Russia, not a strengthening of Russia.  That may not be apparent immediately, but I think it will become increasingly apparent. What its also done is isolated Russia from its trading partners, its commercial partners, international business in ways that I think are going to be very difficult to recover from.  And we will continue to stand firm with our allies and partners that what is happening is wrong, that there is a solution that allows Ukraine and Russia to live peacefully.  But it is not in the cards for us to see a military confrontation between Russia and the United States in this region.  Keep in mind, however, that Im about to go to a NATO conference.  Ukraine is not a member of NATO, but a number of those states that are close by are.  And we take our Article 5 commitments to defend each other very seriously, and that includes the smallest NATO member, as well as the largest NATO member.  And so part of the reason I think this NATO meeting is going to be so important is to refocus attention on the critical function that NATO plays to make sure that every country is contributing in order to deliver on the promise of our Article 5 assurances. Part of the reason Ill be going to Estonia is to let the Estonians know that we mean what we say with respect to our treaty obligations.  We dont have those treaty obligations with Ukraine.  We do, however, stand shoulder to shoulder with them, and were doing not just a lot of work diplomatically but also financially in order to make sure that they have the best chance at dealing with what is admittedly a very difficult situation.   Thank you very much, everybody.   Q: On immigration?  President Obama:  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Q:  Immigration?  Q:  Mr. President, how are external events and your executive decision-making going to impact your decision on immigration reform?", "filename": "28August2014PressStatementontheEconomyIraqandUkraine.txt"}, {"question": "And I know that theres some countries that don't say anything -- and maybe that's easier for leaders to deal with.   But you're kind of stuck with us -- this is how we are.  We believe in these things and we're going to keep on talking about them. And I want to repeat, we do this not because we think our democracy is perfect, or we think that every country has to follow precisely our path.  For more than two centuries since our independence, were still working on perfecting our union.  We're not immune from criticism.  When we fall short of our ideals, we strive to do better.  But when we speak out for our principles, at home and abroad, we stay true to our values and we help lift up the lives of people beyond our borders.  And we think that's important.  And it's especially important, I believe, for those of us of African descent, because we've known what it feels like to be on the receiving end of injustice.  We know what it means to be discriminated against.  We know what it means to be jailed.  So how can we stand by when it's happening to somebody else?", "filename": "28July2015AddresstoAfricanContinentRepresentatives.txt"}, {"question": "We know that the best way to protect Americans ultimately is going to stop this outbreak at the source.  And I just had the privilege of speaking with some of the men and women who are working to do just that -- our Disaster Assistance Response Team on the ground in West Africa. First and foremost, I thanked them for their incredible dedication and compassion.  These are the folks that, from the minute that we saw this Ebola outbreak growing larger than we had seen traditionally, were deployed, were on the ground, and were helping to coordinate the countries where the outbreak is happening to make sure that the response was effective. And it's typical of what America does best -- when others are in trouble, when disease or disaster strikes, Americans help. And no other nation is doing as much to make sure that we contain and ultimately eliminate this outbreak than America. We deployed this DART team to West Africa back in early August.  Theyre now the strategic and operational backbone of Americas response.  Theyve increased the number of Ebola treatment units and burial teams.  Theyve expanded the pipeline of medical personnel and equipment and supplies.  Theyve launched an aggressive education campaign in-country.  The bottom line is, is that theyre doing what it takes to make sure that medical personnel and health care workers from all countries have what they need to get the job done. And the good news is that it's starting to have an impact.  Based on the conversations that I had today with them, theyre starting to see some progress in Liberia, and the infrastructure is beginning to get built out.  That's thanks to the incredible work and dedication of folks from the United States who are leading the way in helping Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. And it's critical that we maintain that leadership.  The truth is that we're going to have to stay vigilant here at home until we stop the epidemic at its source.  And for that, we're going to need to make sure that our doctors and our health care professionals here in the United States are properly trained and informed and that they are coordinated if and when an Ebola case crops up here in the United States.  But whats also critically important is making sure that all the talent, skill, compassion, professionalism, dedication and experience of our folks here can be deployed to help those countries deal with this outbreak at the source. And that's why, yesterday, the CDC announced that we're going to have new monitoring and movement guidance that is sensible, based in science, and tailored to the unique circumstances of each health worker that may be returning from one of these countries after they have provided the kind of help that they need.  In fact, tomorrow I'm going to have a chance to meet with doctors and public health workers whove already returned from fighting this disease in West Africa or who are about to go -- not only to say thank you to them and give them encouragement, but to make sure that we're getting input from them based on the science, based on the facts, based on experience, about how the battle to deal with Ebola is going and how our policies can support the incredible heroism that they are showing. So we don't want to discourage our health care workers from going to the frontlines and dealing with this in an effective way.  Our medical teams here are getting better and better prepared and trained for the possibility of an isolated Ebola case here in the United States.  But in the meantime, we've got to make sure that we continue to provide the support of health workers who are going overseas to deal with the disease where it really has been raging. It's also important for the American people to remind themselves that only two people so far have contracted Ebola on American soil -- the two Dallas nurses who treated a patient who contracted it in West Africa.  Today both of them are disease-free.  I met with one of them, Nina Pham, last week, and she is doing wonderfully.  And I just had a chance to get off the phone with Amber Vinson, who is on her way back home and also, as many of you saw in her press statement today, is doing well also. Of the seven Americans treated for Ebola so far, all have survived.  Right now, the only American still undergoing treatment is Dr. Craig Spencer, who contracted the disease abroad while working to protect others.  And we should be saluting his service.  And we are focused on getting him the best care possible, as well.  And our thoughts and prayers are with him. Meanwhile, the West African nations of Senegal and Nigeria have now been declared Ebola-free.  That's in part because of outstanding work led in many cases by Americans working in coordination with those countries to make sure that we did not see an outbreak there. So the point is, is that this disease can be contained.  It will be defeated.  Progress is possible.  But we're going to have to stay vigilant and we've got to make sure that we're working together.  We have to keep leading the global response.  America cannot look like it is shying away because other people are watching what we do, and if we don't have a robust international response in West Africa, then we are actually endangering ourselves here back home.  In order to do that, we've got to make sure that those workers who are willing and able and dedicated to go over there in a really tough job, that theyre applauded, thanked and supported.  That should be our priority. And we can make sure that when they come back they are being monitored in a prudent fashion.  But we want to make sure that we understand that they are doing Gods work over there.  And theyre doing that to keep us safe.  And I want to make sure that every policy we put in place is supportive of their efforts, because if they are successful then we're not going to have to worry about Ebola here at home. America in the end is not defined by fear.  That's not who we are.  America is defined by possibility.  And when we see a problem and we see a challenge, then we fix it.  We don't just react based on our fears.  We react based on facts and judgment and making smart decisions.  That's how we have built this country and sustained this country and protected this country.  That's why America has defined progress -- because we're not afraid when challenges come up. Thanks to our military, our dedicated medical and health care professionals, the men and women who I spoke to today in West Africa, that leadership and progress continues.  And we're going to keep on making progress and we are going to solve this particular problem just like weve solved every other problem. But it starts with us having the confidence and understanding that, as challenging as this may be, this is something that will get fixed -- in large part because we've got extraordinary Americans with experience, talent, dedication, who are willing to put themselves on the frontlines to get things done. I'll have more to say about this tomorrow when I have those workers here.  But I just wanted to emphasize how proud I am of the people who are already involved in this effort, and how confident I am after speaking to them that, in fact, we're going to get this problem under control. All right?  Thank you. Question:  Are you concerned, sir, that there might be some confusion between the quarantine rules used by the military and used by health care workers and by some states? President Obama:  Well, the military is a different situation, obviously, because they are, first of all, not treating patients. Second of all, they are not there voluntarily, its part of their mission that's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me, the Commander-in-Chief.  So we don't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians.  They are already, by definition, if they're in the military, under more circumscribed conditions. When we have volunteers who are taking time out from their families, from their loved ones and so forth, to go over there because they have a very particular expertise to tackle a very difficult job, we want to make sure that when they come back that we are prudent, that we are making sure that they are not at risk themselves or at risk of spreading the disease, but we don't want to do things that arent based on science and best practices.  Because if we do, then were just putting another barrier on somebody whos already doing really important work on our behalf. And that's not something that I think any of us should want to see happen. All right?", "filename": "28October2014EbolaResponseUpdateSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentlemen:  Seventy years after the founding of the United Nations, it is worth reflecting on what, together, the members of this body have helped to achieve.   Out of the ashes of the Second World War, having witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic age, the United States has worked with many nations in this Assembly to prevent a third world war -- by forging alliances with old adversaries; by supporting the steady emergence of strong democracies accountable to their people instead of any foreign power; and by building an international system that imposes a cost on those who choose conflict over cooperation, an order that recognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people.   That is the work of seven decades.  That is the ideal that this body, at its best, has pursued.  Of course, there have been too many times when, collectively, we have fallen short of these ideals.  Over seven decades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims.  But we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make a system of international rules and norms that are better and stronger and more consistent.  It is this international order that has underwritten unparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity.  It is this collective endeavor thats brought about diplomatic cooperation between the worlds major powers, and buttressed a global economy that has lifted more than a billion people from poverty.  It is these international principles that helped constrain bigger countries from imposing our will on smaller ones, and advanced the emergence of democracy and development and individual liberty on every continent.  This progress is real.  It can be documented in lives saved, and agreements forged, and diseases conquered, and in mouths fed. And yet, we come together today knowing that the march of human progress never travels in a straight line, that our work is far from complete; that dangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, more disordered world.   Today, we see the collapse of strongmen and fragile states breeding conflict, and driving innocent men, women and children across borders on an *epoch epic scale.  Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the vacuum.  Technologies that empower individuals are now also exploited by those who spread disinformation, or suppress dissent, or radicalize our youth.

Audience Member:  I love you, Mr. President! President Obama:  I love you back. Now, last week, I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as President of the United States. And during my inaugural address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesnt require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have, but it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose.  It requires us to act. I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others.  Some debates will be more contentious.  Thats to be expected.  But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling; where a broad consensus is emerging; and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America.  Im here today because the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform. The time is now.  Now is the time.  Now is the time.  Now is the time. Audience:  S se puede!  S se puede! President Obama:  Now is the time. Im here because most Americans agree that its time to fix a system thats been broken for way too long.  Im here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement, and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity.  Now is the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our countrys future. Think about it -- we define ourselves as a nation of immigrants.  Thats who we are -- in our bones.  The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, thats always been one of our greatest strengths.  It keeps our workforce young.  It keeps our country on the cutting edge.  And its helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known. After all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo!.  They created entire new industries that, in turn, created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens.  In recent years, one in four high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants.  One in four new small business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada -- folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans. But we all know that today, we have an immigration system thats out of date and badly broken; a system thats holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class. Right now, we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America; 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows.  Yes, they broke the rules.  They crossed the border illegally.  Maybe they overstayed their visas.  Those are facts.  Nobody disputes them.  But these 11 million men and women are now here.  Many of them have been here for years.  And the overwhelming majority of these individuals arent looking for any trouble.  Theyre contributing members of the community.  They're looking out for their families.  They're looking out for their neighbors.  They're woven into the fabric of our lives. Every day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living.  Often they do that in a shadow economy -- a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay.  And when that happens, its not just bad for them, its bad for the entire economy.  Because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing -- that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules -- theyre the ones who suffer.   They've got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules.  And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened, too. So if we're truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it into the middle class, we've got to fix the system. We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules.  We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable -- businesses for who they hire, and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law.  Thats common sense.  And thats why we need comprehensive immigration reform. Theres another economic reason why we need reform.  Its not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy.  Its also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so, and the effect that has on our economy. Right now, there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities.  Theyre earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science.  But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, theres a good chance theyll have to leave our country.  Think about that. Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.  Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here.  Right now in one of those classrooms, theres a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea -- their Intel or Instagram -- into a big business.  Were giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then were going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else?", "filename": "29January2013ComprehensiveImmigrationReformSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Second, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities.  And today, deportations of criminals is at its highest level ever. And third, we took up the cause of the DREAMers -- the young people who were brought to this country as children, young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here.  We said that if youre able to meet some basic criteria like pursuing an education, then well consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong. But because this change isnt permanent, we need Congress to act -- and not just on the DREAM Act.  We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now.  That's what we need. Now, the good news is that for the first time in many years, Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together.  Members of both parties, in both chambers, are actively working on a solution.  Yesterday, a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles Ive proposed and campaigned on for the last few years.  So at this moment, it looks like theres a genuine desire to get this done soon, and thats very encouraging. But this time, action must follow.  We can't allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate.  We've been debating this a very long time.  So it's not as if we don't know technically what needs to get done.  As a consequence, to help move this process along, today Im laying out my ideas for immigration reform.  And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas Im proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush.  You don't get that matchup very often. So we know where the consensus should be. Now, of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details, and every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process.  But its important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place.  And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away. So the principles are pretty straightforward.  There are a lot of details behind it.  We're going to hand out a bunch of paper so that everybody will know exactly what we're talking about.  But the principles are pretty straightforward. First, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement.  That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders.  It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers.  To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out whos here legally, whos not.  So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someones employment status.  And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties. Second, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally.  We all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship.  But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship. Weve got to lay out a path -- a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line, behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally.  That's only fair, right? So that means it wont be a quick process but it will be a fair process.  And it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to a green card and eventually to citizenship. And the third principle is weve got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time. For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldnt have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America.  You shouldn't have to wait years. If youre a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology, or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here.  Because if you succeed, youll create American businesses and American jobs.  Youll help us grow our economy.  Youll help us strengthen our middle class. So thats what comprehensive immigration reform looks like:  smarter enforcement; a pathway to earned citizenship; improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world.  Its pretty straightforward. The question now is simple:  Do we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a government to finally put this issue behind us?", "filename": "29January2013ComprehensiveImmigrationReformSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "And thats still true today.  Just ask Alan Aleman.  Alan is here this afternoon -- where is Alan?", "filename": "29January2013ComprehensiveImmigrationReformSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "There are a lot of folks out there who are still struggling with the effects of the recession. Many people are still looking for work or looking for a job that pays more. Families are wondering how they'd deal with a broken refrigerator or a busted transmission, or how they're going to finance their kids' college education, and they're also worrying about the possibility of layoffs. The struggles of middle-class families were a big problem long before the recession hit in 2007. They werent created overnight, and the truth is our economic challenges are not going to be solved overnight. But there are more steps that we can take right now that would help businesses create jobs here in America. Today, our administration is trying to take those steps, so we're reviewing government regulations so that we can fix any rules in place that are an unnecessary burden on businesses. Were working with the private sector to get small businesses and start-ups the financing they need to grow and expand. And because of the partnership that weve launched with businesses and community colleges, 500,000 workers will be able to receive the right skills and training for manufacturing jobs in companies all across America -- jobs that companies are looking to fill. In addition to the steps that my administration can take on our own, there are also things that Congress could do right now that will help create good jobs. Right now, Congress can send me a bill that would make it easier for entrepreneurs to patent a new product or idea -- because we cant give innovators in other countries a big leg up when it comes to opening new businesses and creating new jobs. That's something Congress could do right now. Right now, Congress could send me a bill that puts construction workers back on the job rebuilding roads and bridges -- not by having government fund and pick every project, but by providing loans to private companies and states and local governments on the basis of merit and not politics. That's pending in Congress right now.     Right now, Congress can advance a set of trade agreements that would allow American businesses to sell more of their goods and services to countries in Asia and South America -- agreements that would support tens of thousands of American jobs while helping those adversely affected by trade. That's pending before Congress right now.   And right now, we could give middle-class families the security of knowing that the tax cut I signed in December will be there for one more year.   So there are a number of steps that my administration is taking, but there are also a number of steps that Congress could be taking right now on items that historically have had bipartisan support and that would help put more Americans back to work. Many of these ideas have been tied up in Congress for some time. But, as I said, all of them enjoy bipartisan support, and all of them would help grow the economy. So I urge Congress to act on these ideas now. Of course, one of the most important and urgent things we can do for the economy is something that both parties are working on right now -- and thats reducing our nations deficit. Over the last few weeks, the Vice President has been leading negotiations with Democrats and Republicans on this issue, and theyve made some real progress in narrowing down the differences. As of last week, both parties had identified more than 1 trillion dollars worth of spending cuts already. But everyone also knows that well need to do more to close the deficit.  We cant get to the 4 trillion dollars in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we cant just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare. So were going to need to look at the whole budget, as I said several months ago. And weve got to eliminate waste wherever we find it and make some tough decisions about worthy priorities. And that means trimming the defense budget, while still meeting our security needs. It means well have to tackle entitlements, as long as we keep faith with seniors and children with disabilities by maintaining the fundamental security that Medicare and Medicaid provide. And, yes, were going to have to tackle spending in the tax code. Theres been a lot of discussion about revenues and raising taxes in recent weeks, so I want to be clear about what were proposing here. I spent the last two years cutting taxes for ordinary Americans, and I want to extend those middle-class tax cuts. The tax cuts Im proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires; tax breaks for oil companies and hedge fund managers and corporate jet owners. It would be nice if we could keep every tax break there is, but weve got to make some tough choices here if we want to reduce our deficit. And if we choose to keep those tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires, if we choose to keep a tax break for corporate jet owners, if we choose to keep tax breaks for oil and gas companies that are making hundreds of billions of dollars, then that means weve got to cut some kids off from getting a college scholarship. That means weve got to stop funding certain grants for medical research. That means that food safety may be compromised. That means that Medicare has to bear a greater part of the burden.  Those are the choices we have to make. So the bottom line is this: Any agreement to reduce our deficit is going to require tough decisions and balanced solutions. And before we ask our seniors to pay more for health care, before we cut our childrens education, before we sacrifice our commitment to the research and innovation that will help create more jobs in the economy, I think its only fair to ask an oil company or a corporate jet owner that has done so well to give up a tax break that no other business enjoys. I dont think thats real radical. I think the majority of Americans agree with that. So the good news is, because of the work thats been done, I this we can actually bridge our differences. I think there is a conceptual framework that would allow us to make huge progress on our debt and deficit, and do so in a way that does not hurt our economy right here and right now. And its not often that Washington sees both parties agree on the scale and the urgency of the challenge at hand. Nobody wants to put the creditworthiness of the United States in jeopardy. Nobody wants to see the United States default. So weve got to seize this moment, and we have to seize it soon. The Vice President and I will continue these negotiations with both leaders of both parties in Congress for as long as it takes, and we will reach a deal that will require our government to live within its means and give our businesses confidence and get this economy moving. So, with that, I will take your questions. Ive got my list here. Starting off with Ben Feller, Associated Press. Question: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Id like to follow up on the comments you just made as you try to reach a deal to raise the debt limit and cut the deficit. You keep saying that there needs to be this balanced approach of spending cuts and taxes.  But Republicans say flatly, they wont -- President Obama: That they dont want a balanced approach. Question: They dont want any tax increases, as they put it. And the House Speaker says not only that he doesnt support that, but that plan wont -- will not pass the House. So my question is will you insist, ultimately, that a deal has to include those tax increases that you just laid out? Is that an absolute red line for you? And if it is, can you explain to us how that can possibly get through the Congress? President Obama: Look, I think that what weve seen in negotiations here in Washington is a lot of people say a lot of things to satisfy their base or to get on cable news, but that hopefully, leaders at a certain point rise to the occasion and they do the right thing for the American people. And thats what I expect to happen this time. Call me nave, but my expectation is that leaders are going to lead. Now, I just want to be clear about whats at stake here. The Republicans say they want to reduce the deficit. Every single observer whos not an elected official, whos not a politician, says we cant reduce our deficit in the scale and scope that we need to without having a balanced approach that looks at everything. Democrats have to accept some painful spending cuts that hurt some of our constituencies and we may not like. And weve shown a willingness to do that for the greater good. To say, look, there are some things that are good programs that are nice to have; we cant afford them right now. I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to have difficult conversations with the Pentagon saying, you know what, theres fat here; were going to have to trim it out. And Bob Gates has already done a good job identifying 400 billion dollars in cuts, but were going to do more. And I promise you the preference of the Pentagon would not to cut any more, because they feel like theyve already given. So were going to have to look at entitlements -- and thats always difficult politically. But Ive been willing to say we need to see where we can reduce the cost of health care spending and Medicare and Medicaid in the out-years, not by shifting costs on to seniors, as some have proposed, but rather by actually reducing those costs. But even if were doing it in a smart way, that's still tough politics. But its the right thing to do. So the question is, if everybody else is willing to take on their sacred cows and do tough things in order to achieve the goal of real deficit reduction, then I think it would be hard for the Republicans to stand there and say that the tax break for corporate jets is sufficiently important that were not willing to come to the table and get a deal done. Or, were so concerned about protecting oil and gas subsidies for oil companies that are making money hand over fist -- that's the reason were not going to come to a deal. I don't think that's a sustainable position. And the truth of the matter is, if you talk to Republicans who are not currently in office, like Alan Simpson who co-chaired my bipartisan commission, he doesnt think that's a sustainable position. Pete Domenici, Republican, co-chaired something with Alice Rivlin, the Democrat, says that's -- he doesnt think that's a sustainable position. You cant reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix. And the revenue were talking about isnt coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling. Its coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you are a wealthy CEO or a health -- hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. Theyre lower than theyve been since the 1950s. And you can afford it. Youll still be able to ride on your corporate jet; youre just going to have to pay a little more. And if we -- I just want to emphasize what I said earlier. If we do not have revenues, that means there are a bunch of kids out there who are not getting college scholarships. If we do not have those revenues, then the kinds of cuts that would be required might compromise the National Weather Service. It means that we would not be funding critical medical research. It means that food inspection might be compromised. And Ive said to some of the Republican leaders, you go talk to your constituents, the Republican constituents, and ask them are they willing to compromise their kids safety so that some corporate jet owner continues to get a tax break. And Im pretty sure what the answer would be. So were going to keep on having these conversations. And my belief is, is that the Republican leadership in Congress will, hopefully sooner rather than later, come to the conclusion that they need to make the right decisions for the country; that everybody else has been willing to move off their maximalist position -- they need to do the same. Question: You think they'll ultimately give in? President Obama: My expectation is that theyll do the responsible thing. Chuck Todd. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President. There have been a lot of questions about the constitutionality -- constitutional interpretations of a few decisions youve made, so Ill just simply ask: Do you believe the War Powers Act is constitutional? Do you believe that the debt limit is constitutional, the idea that Congress can do this? And do you believe that marriage is a civil right? President Obama: Well, that was a hodgepodge. Chuck, were going to assign you to the Supreme Court, man. Im not a Supreme Court justice so Im not going to -- putting my constitutional law professor hat on here.  Let me focus on, initially, the issue of Libya. I want to talk about the substance of Libya because theres been all kinds of noise about process and congressional consultation and so forth. Lets talk about concretely whats happened. Muammar Qaddafi, who, prior to Osama bin Laden, was responsible for more American deaths than just about anybody on the planet, was threatening to massacre his people. And as part of an international coalition, under a U.N. mandate that is almost unprecedented, we went in and took out air defense systems so that an international coalition could provide a no-fly zone, could protect -- provide humanitarian protection to the people on the ground. I spoke to the American people about what we would do. I said there would be no troops on the ground. I said that we would not be carrying the lions share of this operation, but as members of NATO, we would be supportive of it because its in our national security interest and also because its the right thing to do. We have done exactly what I said we would do. We have not put any boots on the ground.  And our allies -- who, historically, weve complained arent willing to carry enough of the load when it comes to NATO operations -- have carried a big load when it comes to these NATO operations. And as a consequence, weve protected thousands of people in Libya; we have not seen a single U.S. casualty; theres no risks of additional escalation. This operation is limited in time and in scope. So I said to the American people, heres our narrow mission. We have carried out that narrow mission in exemplary fashion. And throughout this process we consulted with Congress. Weve had 10 hearings on it. Weve sent reams of information about what the operations are. Ive had all the members of Congress over to talk about it.  So a lot of this fuss is politics. And if you look substantively at what weve done, we have done exactly what we said to do, under a U.N. mandate, and we have protected thousands of lives in the process. And as a consequence, a guy who was a state sponsor of terrorist operations against the United States of America is pinned down and the noose is tightening around him. Now, when you look at the history of the War Powers resolution, it came up after the Vietnam War in which we had half-a-million soldiers there, tens of thousands of lives lost, hundreds of billions of dollars spent -- and Congress said, you know what, we dont want something like that happening again. So if youre going to start getting us into those kinds of commitments youve got to consult with Congress beforehand. And I think that such consultation is entirely appropriate. But do I think that our actions in any way violate the War Powers resolution? The answer is no. So I dont even have to get to the constitutional question. There may be a time in which there was a serious question as to whether or not the War Powers resolution -- act was constitutional. I dont have to get to the question. We have engaged in a limited operation to help a lot of people against one of the worst tyrants in the world -- somebody who nobody should want to defend -- and we should be sending a unified message to this guy that he should step down and give his people a fair chance to live their lives without fear. And this suddenly becomes the cause clbre for some folks in Congress? Come on. So you had, what, a three-parter? What are the other two? Question: There is some question about the constitutionality of the War Powers Act. President Obama: Im just saying I dont have to reach it. Thats a good legal answer. Question: [Inaudible.] President Obama: Let me start by saying that this administration, under my direction, has consistently said we cannot discriminate as a country against people on the basis of sexual orientation. And we have done more in the two and a half years that Ive been in here than the previous 43 Presidents to uphold that principle, whether its ending dont ask, dont tell, making sure that gay and lesbian partners can visit each other in hospitals, making sure that federal benefits can be provided to same-sex couples. Across the board -- hate crimes  -- we have made sure that that is a central principle of this administration, because I think its a central principle of America. Now, what weve also done is weve said that DOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, is unconstitutional. And so weve said we cannot defend the federal government poking its nose into what states are doing and putting the thumb on the scale against same-sex couples. What Ive seen happen over the last several years, and what happened in New York last week I think was a good thing, because what you saw was the people of New York having a debate, talking through these issues. It was contentious; it was emotional; but, ultimately, they made a decision to recognize civil marriage. And I think thats exactly how things should work. And so I think it is -- I think it is important for us to work through these issues -- because each community is going to be different and each state is going to be different -- to work through them. In the meantime, we filed a -- we filed briefs before the Supreme Court that say we think that any discrimination against gays, lesbians, transgenders is subject to heightened scrutiny, and we don't think that DOMA is unconstitutional [sic]. And so I think the combination of what states are doing, what the courts are doing, the actions that were taking administratively, all are how the process should work. Question: Are you at all uncomfortable that there could be different rules in different states, you know, and for somebody to make the argument that's what we saw during segregation -- President Obama: Chuck, I think what youre seeing is a profound recognition on the part of the American people that gays and lesbians and transgender persons are our brothers, our sisters, our children, our cousins, our friends, our co-workers, and that theyve got to be treated like every other American. And I think that principle will win out. Its not going to be perfectly smooth, and it turns out that the President -- Ive discovered since Ive been in this office -- cant dictate precisely how this process moves. But I think were moving in a direction of greater equality and I think thats a good thing. Julianna. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. I only have a two-parter. President Obama: Thanks. Question: Are you concerned that the current debate over debt and deficits is preventing you from taking the kind of decisive and more balanced action needed to create jobs in this country, which is the number one concern for Americans? And also, one of the impediments to job growth that the business community repeatedly cites is the regulatory environment. So do you think that the NLRB complaint against Boeing, that this has created some of the -- is an example of the kinds of regulations that chill job growth, and also that you yourself have called just plain dumb? President Obama: I think its important to understand that deficit reduction, debt reduction, should be part of an overall package for job growth over the long term. Its not the only part of it, but its an important part of it. President Obama: So as I mentioned at the top, I think its important for us to look at rebuilding our transportation infrastructure in this country. That could put people back to work right now -- construction workers back to work right now. And it would get done work that America needs to get done. We used to have the best roads, the best bridges, the best airports. We dont anymore. And thats not good for our long-term competitiveness. So we could put people to work right now and make sure that were in a good position to win the future, as well. I think -- Question: -- spending and [inaudible.] President Obama: Im going to get to it. I think that its important for us to look at the tax code and figure out, are there ways that we can simplify it and also build on the work that weve already done, for example, saying to small businesses or start-up businesses, you don't have to pay capital gains when youre in start-up mode, because we want you to get out there and start a business. That's important. Making sure that SBA is helping to get financing to small businesses, that's important. So there are a whole range of things that we can be doing. I think these trade deals will be important -- because right now South Korea, frankly, has a better deal when it comes to our trading relationship than we do. Part of the reason I want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States and you don't see any American cars in Korea. So lets rebalance that trading relationship. That's why we should get this passed. So there are a range of things that we could be doing right now. Deficit and debt reduction should be seen as part of that overall process, because I think if businesses feel confident that weve got our act together here in Washington, that not only is the government not going to default but were also preparing for a future in which the population is getting older and were going to have more expenses on the Medicare side and Social Security, that businesses will feel more confident about investing here in the United States of America. So I don't think theyre contradictory. And as Ive said before, certainly in my job, but I think Congress, as well, theyve got to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. So we can focus on jobs at the same time as were focusing on debt and deficit reduction. Now, one of the things that my administration has talked about is, is there, in fact, a bunch of -- a tangle of regulations out there that are preventing businesses from growing and expanding as quickly as they should. Keep in mind that the business community is always complaining about regulations. When unemployment is at 3 percent and they're making record profits, they're going to still complain about regulations because, frankly, they want to be able to do whatever they think is going to maximize their profits. Ive got an obligation to make sure that were upholding smart regulations that protect our air and protect our water and protect our food. If youre flying on a plane, you want to make sure that there are some regulations in place to assure safety in air travel, right? So there are some core regulations that weve got to maintain.  But what I have done -- and this is unprecedented, by the way, no administration has done this before -- is Ive said to each agency, don't just look at current regulations -- or don't just look at future regulations, regulations that were proposing, lets go backwards and look at regulations that are already on the books, and if they don't make sense, lets get rid of them. And we are in the process of doing that, and weve already identified changes that could potentially save billions of dollars for companies over the next several years.   Now, you asked specifically about one decision that was made by the National Labor Relations Board, the NLRB, and this relates to Boeing. Essentially, the NLRB made a finding that Boeing had not followed the law in making a decision to move a plant.  And its an independent agency. Its going before a judge. So I don't want to get into the details of the case. I don't know all the facts. That's going to be up to a judge to decide. What I do know is this -- that as a general proposition, companies need to have the freedom to relocate. They have to follow the law, but thats part of our system. And if theyre choosing to relocate here in the United States, thats a good thing. And what it doesnt make -- what I think defies common sense would be a notion that we would be shutting down a plant or laying off workers because labor and management cant come to a sensible agreement. So my hope is, is that even as this thing is working its way through, everybody steps back for a second and says, look, if jobs are being created here in the United States, lets make sure that were encouraging that. And we cant afford to have labor and management fighting all the time, at a time when were competing against Germany and China and other countries that want to sell goods all around the world. And obviously, the airplane industry is an area where we still have a huge advantage, and I want to make sure that we keep it. Mark Lander. Question: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Yesterday, Admiral McRaven testified before Congress that he was concerned that there wasnt a clear procedure to be followed if a terrorist were captured alive abroad. The administration has also been clear that it doesnt want to continue to send suspected terrorists to Guantanamo. What message do you have for American men and women in uniform who are undertaking missions, like the very risky one to capture and kill bin Laden, about what they should do in the event that they capture someone alive? And does the lack of these clear procedures raise the risk that forces might be more inclined to kill suspected terrorists in the field, rather than capture them alive, thus depriving the U.S. of the intelligence that they could provide? President Obama: Well, first of all, my top priority in each and every one of these situations is to make sure that were apprehending those who would attack the United States; that we are getting all the intelligence that we can out of these individuals, in a way thats consistent with due process of law; and that we try them, we prosecute them, in a way thats consistent with rule of law. And, frankly, there are going to be different dispositions of the case depending on the situation. And there are going to be sometimes where a military commission may be appropriate. There are going to be some times where Article III courts are appropriate in terms of prosecution. And we do have a process to work through all the agencies -- Department of Defense, Department of Justice, FBI, anybody else who might be involved in these kinds of operations -- to think through on a case-by-case basis how a particular individual should be dealt with. And I think that when it comes to our men and women in uniform who might be carrying out these missions, the instructions are not going to be based on whether or not the lawyers can sort out how we detain them or how we prosecute them. Their mission is to make sure that they apprehend the individual; they do so safely with minimum risk to American lives. And thats always going to be the priority, is just carrying out the mission. And that message is sent consistently to our men and women in uniform anytime they start carrying out one of these missions. But I think its important to understand, and the American people need to be assured that anytime we initiate a mission like this, our top priorities are making sure this person is not able to carry out attacks against the United States and that were able to obtain actionable intelligence from those individuals. And so that mitigates against this danger that youre suggesting that our main goal is going to be to kill these individuals as opposed to potentially capturing them. Okay? Mike Emanuel, FOX. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Last week when you gave your Afghanistan drawdown speech, the word victory, in terms of the overall war in Afghanistan, was not in your speech. So Im wondering, sir, if you can define for the 100,000 troops you have in harms way in Afghanistan victory in the war, and for their families, as well, sir. President Obama: Well, I didn't use victory in my West Point speech, either.  What I said was we can be successful in our mission, which is narrowly drawn, and that is to make sure that al Qaeda cannot attack the United States of America or our allies or our interests overseas, and to make sure that we have an Afghan government that -- and an Afghan people that can provide for their own security. We are being successful in those missions. And the reason that were in a position to draw down 10,000 troops this year and a total of 33,000 troops by the end of next summer is precisely because of the extraordinary work of our men and women in uniform. What theyve been able to do is to severely cripple al Qaedas capacities. Obviously bin Laden got the most attention, but even before the bin Laden operation we had decimated the middle ranks and some of the upper ranks of al Qaeda.  Theyre having a great deal of difficulty operating, a great deal of difficulty communicating and financing themselves, and we are going to keep the pressure on.  And in part that's because of the extraordinary sacrifices that have been made by our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan. What weve also been able to do is to ramp up the training of Afghan forces. So weve got an additional 100,000 Afghan troops, both Army and police, that have been trained as a consequence of this surge. And that is going to give the Afghans more capacity to defend themselves because it is in our national interest to make sure that you did not have a collapse of Afghanistan in which extremist elements could flood the zone once again, and over time al Qaeda might be in a position to rebuild itself.   So what I laid out was a plan in which we are going to be drawing down our troops from Afghanistan after 10 very long years and an enormous sacrifice by our troops. But we will draw them in a -- draw them down in a responsible way that will allow Afghanistan to defend itself and will give us the operational capacity to continue to put pressure on al Qaeda until that network is entirely defeated. Question: The attack on the Intercontinental Hotel yesterday, sir? And does that concern you that Afghan forces may not be able to step up if these guys are able to attack a high-profile target in the nations capital? President Obama: Well, keep in mind the drawdown hasnt begun. So we understood that Afghanistan is a dangerous place, that the Taliban is still active, and that there are still going to be events like this on occasion. The question is, in terms of overall trend, is Afghanistan capacity increasing. Kabul, for example, which contains a huge proportion of the Afghan population as a whole, has been largely policed by Afghan forces for quite some time. And theyve done a reasonably good job. Kabul is much safer than it was, and Afghan forces in Kabul are much more capable than they were. That doesnt mean that there are not going to be events like this potentially taking place, and that will probably go on for some time. Our work is not done. But as I said in my speech, the tide of war is receding. We have shifted to a transition phase. And much like weve seen in Iraq, where we've drawn down our troops, the remainder of our troops will be coming out by the end of this year, but Iraq has been able to maintain a democratic government and to tamp down violence there -- we think a similar approach makes sense in Afghanistan. But even in Iraq, you still see the occasional attack. These are still countries that are digging themselves out of a lot of war, a lot of conflict. Theyre dangerous places.  And so theyre not going to be perfectly safe, even if we were there. But we can improve the chances for the Afghan people to defend themselves. Jim Sciutto. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. Youre aware that Senators Kerry and McCain have a proposal on the Senate floor to give you the leeway to continue operations in Libya for a further year. Youve just said that this, from the beginning, has been an operation limited in time and scope.  Initially you said days, not weeks. Are you prepared, are the American people prepared for this operation, with American support, to continue for a further year? And is there any other definition of success than Qaddafi being removed from power? President Obama: Well, first of all, Jim, just a slight correction. What I told the American people was that the initial phase where Americans were in the lead would take days, perhaps weeks. And thats exactly what happened, right? I mean, after -- around two weeks, a little less than two weeks, we had transitioned where NATO had taken full control of the operation. So promise made, promise kept. Second, I think when you have the former Republican nominee for President, John McCain, and the former nominee for President on the Democratic side, John Kerry, coming together to support what were doing in Libya, that should tell the American people that this is important. And I very much appreciate their efforts in that regard. Third, when it comes to our definitions of success, the U.N. mandate has said that we are there to make sure that you do not see a massacre directed against Libyan civilians by the Libyan regime. The Libyan regimes capacity has been greatly reduced as a consequence of our operation. Thats already been successful. What weve seen both in the East and in the West is that opposition forces have been able to mobilize themselves and start getting organized, and people are starting to see the possibility of a more peaceful future on the horizon. What is also true is, as long as Qaddafi is still presenting himself as the head of the Libyan government, and as long as he still controls large numbers of troops, the Libyan people are going to be in danger of counter-offensives and of retribution. So there is no doubt that Qaddafi stepping down from power is -- from the international communitys perspective -- going to be the primary way that we can assure that the overall mission of Libyas people being protected is accomplished. And I just want to point out -- I know it's something you know -- the International Criminal Court identified Qaddafi as having violated international law, having committed war crimes. What weve seen is reports of troops engaging in horrible acts, including potentially using rape as a weapon of war. And so when you have somebody like that in charge of large numbers of troops, I think it would be hard for us to feel confident that the Libyan people are going to be protected unless he steps down. Now, what that means, whether theres the possibility of Libyans arriving at some sort of political settlement, that I think is something that ultimately the Libyan people are going to have to make a decision about -- because the international community is there in service of that broader goal, of a peaceful Libya. Question: Would you accept a political settlement with him involved as success from the American perspective? President Obama: I would accept him stepping down so that he is not directing armed forces against the Libyan people. He needs to step down. He needs to go. Laura Meckler. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. In these debt talks, would you accept -- would you like to see some sort of tax breaks aimed at stimulating the economy, even though that would of course add to the deficit itself? And Id also like to follow up on one of your earlier answers about same-sex marriage. You said that its a positive step that so many states, including New York, are moving towards that. Does that mean that you personally now do support same-sex marriage, putting aside what individual states decide? Is that your personal view? President Obama: Im not going to make news on that today. Good try, though. And with respect to the deficit and debt talks and where we need to go, I do think its important, since were looking at how do we reduce the debt and deficit both in a 10-year window as well as beyond a 10-year window, to understand that one of the most important things we can do for debt and deficit reduction is to grow the economy. And so if there are steps that in the short term may reduce the amount of cash in the treasury but in the long term mean that were growing at 3.5 percent instead of 2.5 percent, then those ideas are worth exploring. Obviously that was what we did in December during the lame duck session, when Democrats and Republicans came together and we said, you know what, a payroll tax cut makes sense in order to boost the economy; unemployment insurance makes sense in order to boost the economy. All that stuff puts money in peoples pockets at a time when theyre still struggling to dig themselves out of this recession. And so the American people have an extra thousand dollars, on average, in their pockets because of the tax cuts that we initiated. And that has helped cushion some of the tough stuff that happened in the first six months of this year, including the effects on oil prices as a consequence of what happened in the Middle East as well as what happened in Japan. I think that it makes perfect sense for us to take a look at can we extend the payroll tax, for example, an additional year, and other tax breaks for business investment that could make a big difference in terms of creating more jobs right now. What we need to do is to restore business confidence and the confidence of the American people that were on track -- that were not going to get there right away, that this is a tough slog, but that we still are moving forward. And I think that it makes sense, as were looking at an overall package, to see, are there some things that we can do to sustain the recovery, so long as the overall package achieves our goals -- the goals that I set out, which is $4 trillion within a 10-to 12-year window, and making sure that were bending the costs of things like health care over the long term. Question: I'm sorry, I know you dont want to say anything further on the same-sex marriage issue, but what you said before really led me to believe that thats what is in your personal mind. And Im wondering what's the distinction youre drawing. President Obama: Laura, I think this has been asked and answered. I'll -- I'll just -- I'll...keep on giving you the -- the same answer until I give you a different one, all right? And that wont be today. Question: That's going to be -- [inaudible.] President Obama: Yes, exactly. I thought youd like that one. Antonieta Cdiz?  There you are. Question: Thank you very much, Mr. President. First, if you receive a mandatory E-verify bill only without legalization, are you planning to veto that deal? And second, on Fast and Furious, members of Congress and the government of Mexico are still waiting for answers. Are you planning to replace ATF leadership?  And when can we expect the results of the current investigation? President Obama: On the second question, as you know, my attorney general has made clear that he certainly would not have ordered gun running to be able to pass through into Mexico. The investigation is still pending. Im not going to comment on a current investigation. Ive made very clear my views that that would not be an appropriate step by the ATF, and we got to find out how that happened. As soon as the investigation is completed, I think appropriate actions will be taken. With respect to E-verify, we need comprehensive immigration reform. Ive said it before. I will say it again. I will say it next week. And Ill say it six months from now.  Weve got to have a system that makes sure that we uphold our tradition as a nation of laws and that we also uphold our tradition as a nation of immigrants. And that means tough border security, going after employers that are illegally hiring and exploiting workers, making sure that we also have a pathway for legal status for those who are living in the shadows right now. We may not be able to get everything that I would like to see in a package, but we have to have a balanced package. E-verify can be an important enforcement tool if its not riddled with errors, if U.S. citizens are protected -- because what I don't want is a situation in which employers are forced to set up a system that they cant be certain works. And we don't want to expose employers to the risk where they end up rejecting a qualified candidate for a job because the list says that that person is an illegal immigrant, and it turns out that the person isnt an illegal immigrant. That wouldnt be fair for the employee and would probably get the employer in trouble as well. So I think the goal right now is to lets continue to see if we can perfect the E-verify system. Lets make sure that we have safeguards in place to prevent the kind of scenarios that I talked about. But lets also not lose sight of some of the other components to immigration reform. For example, making sure that DREAM Act kids -- kids who have grown up here in the United States, think of themselves as Americans, who are not legal through no fault of their own, and who are ready to invest and give back to our country and go to school and fight in our military and start businesses here -- lets make sure that those kids can stay. We need to have a more balanced approach than just a verification system. Question: Mr. President -- Mr. President, you don't have any timeline for the [inaudible] President Obama: I dont have an answer as to whether the investigation is completed yet, and it wouldnt be appropriate for me to comment on the investigation if I dont -- if its not yet completed. Jessica Yellin.  Congratulations, your first question here. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. President Obama: No pressure. Youre going to do great. Question: Thank you. Your administration has laid out four different dates by which youve said that the debt ceiling must be raised or the U.S. would face potential dire consequences. Three of those dates have come and gone and we havent faced financial calamity. Some of your critics have argued that these are then scare tactics to force a deal. So why should the American people believe that the August 2nd deadline is the final deadline by which a deal must be raised? And would you also spell out for us what you believe will happen if the debt ceiling is not raised by that date? President Obama: Jessica, lets be clear. We havent given out four different dates.  We have given out dates that are markers for us getting into trouble. Its the equivalent of youre driving down the street and the yellow light starts flashing. The yellow light is flashing. Now, it hasnt been a red light yet. So what Tim Geithner has said is, technically speaking, were in a position now where were having to do a whole bunch of things to make sure that our bills are paid. By August 2nd, we run out of tools to make sure that all our bills are paid. So that is a hard deadline. And I want everybody to understand that this is a jobs issue. This is not an abstraction. If the United States government, for the first time, cannot pay its bills, if it defaults, then the consequences for the U.S. economy will be significant and unpredictable. And that is not a good thing.   We dont know how capital markets will react. But if capital markets suddenly decide, you know what, the U.S. government doesnt pay its bills, so were going to start pulling our money out, and the U.S. Treasury has to start to raise interest rates in order to attract more money to pay off our bills, that means higher interest rates for businesses; that means higher interest rates for consumers. So all the headwinds that were already experiencing in terms of the recovery will get worse. Thats not my opinion. I think thats a consensus opinion. And that means that job growth will be further stymied, it will be further hampered, as a consequence of that decision. So thats point number one. Point number two, I want to address what Ive been hearing from some quarters, which is, well, maybe this debt limit thing is not really that serious; we can just pay interest on the debt. This idea has been floating around in some Republican circles. This is the equivalent of me saying, you know what, I will choose to pay my mortgage, but Im not going to pay my car note. Or Im going to pay my car note but Im not going to pay my student loan. Now, a lot of people in really tough situations are having to make those tough decisions. But for the U.S. government to start picking and choosing like that is not going to inspire a lot of confidence. Moreover, which bills are we going to decide to pay? These guys have said, well, maybe we just pay the interest on -- for bondholders. So are we really going to start paying interest to Chinese who hold treasuries and were not going to pay folks their Social Security checks? Or were not going to pay to veterans for their disability checks? I mean, which bills, which obligations, are we going to say we dont have to pay? And last point I want to make about this. These are bills that Congress ran up. The money has been spent. The obligations have been made. So this isnt a situation -- I think the American people have to understand this -- this is not a situation where Congress is going to say, okay, we wont -- we wont buy this car or we wont take this vacation. They took the vacation. They bought the car. And now theyre saying maybe we dont have to pay, or we dont have to pay as fast as we said we were going to, or -- thats not how responsible families act. And were the greatest nation on Earth, and we cant act that way. So this is urgent and it needs to get settled. Question: So is August 2nd a yellow light or a red light? President Obama: I think people should think of -- look, Im the President of the United States and I want to make sure that I am not engaging in scare tactics. And Ive tried to be responsible and somewhat restrained so that folks dont get spooked.   August 2nd is a very important date. And theres no reason why we cant get this done now. We know what the options are out there. This is not a technical problem any longer. This is a matter of Congress going ahead and biting the bullet and making some tough decisions. Because we know what the decisions are. We've identified what spending cuts are possible. We've identified what defense cuts are possible.  We've identified what health care cuts are possible. We've identified what loopholes in the tax code can be closed that would also raise revenue. Weve identified what the options are. And the question now is are we going to step up and get this done. And, you know, Malia and Sasha generally finish their homework a day ahead of time. Malia is 13, Sasha is 10. Question: Impressive. President Obama: It is impressive. They dont wait until the night before. Theyre not pulling all-nighters. Theyre 13 and 10.  Congress can do the same thing.  If you know youve got to do something, just do it. And Ive got to say, Im very amused when I start hearing comments about, well, the President needs to show more leadership on this. Let me tell you something. Right after we finished dealing with the government shutdown, averting a government shutdown, I called the leaders here together. I said weve got to get done -- get this done. I put Vice President Biden in charge of a process -- that, by the way, has made real progress -- but these guys have met, worked through all of these issues. I met with every single caucus for an hour to an hour and a half each -- Republican senators, Democratic senators; Republican House, Democratic House. Ive met with the leaders multiple times. At a certain point, they need to do their job. And so, this thing, which is just not on the level, where we have meetings and discussions, and were working through process, and when they decide theyre not happy with the fact that at some point youve got to make a choice, they just all step back and say, well, you know, the President needs to get this done -- they need to do their job.   Now is the time to go ahead and make the tough choices. Thats why theyre called leaders. And Ive already shown that Im willing to make some decisions that are very tough and will give my base of voters further reason to give me a hard time. But its got to be done. And so theres no point in procrastinating. Theres no point in putting it off.  Weve got to get this done. And if by the end of this week, we have not seen substantial progress, then I think members of Congress need to understand we are going to start having to cancel things and stay here until we get it done. They're in one week, they're out one week. And then they're saying, Obama has got to step in. You need to be here. Ive been here. Ive been doing Afghanistan and bin Laden and the Greek crisis. You stay here. Lets get it done. All right.  I think you know my feelings about that. Caren Bohan. Question: Thank you, Mr. President. You talked about the payroll tax holiday and possibly extending that. Are you worried, though, that by adding a discussion of short-term measures on the economy into these discussions about long-term deficit reductions that that may complicate the conversation and make it harder to pass a debt limit?", "filename": "29June2011PresseronCongressionalActiontoPromoteJobGrowth.txt"}, {"question": "Thank you. Thank you! Thank you so much. Please, please be seated. Audience Member: I love you, Obama! President Obama: Oh, I love Joplin! I love Joplin. President Obama: To -- Audience Member: We love Joplin! President Obama: We love Joplin. Thank you, Governor, for that powerful message, but more importantly, for being here with and for your people every step of the way. We are grateful to you, to Reverend Gariss, Father Monaghan. Im so glad you got in that tub. To Reverend Brown for that incredibly powerful message. To Senator Claire McCaskill, whos been here, and Congressman Billy Long; Mayor Woolston. To Craig Fugate. It doesnt get a lot of attention, but he heads up FEMA, our emergency response at the federal level. Hes been going from Tuscaloosa to Joplin and everywhere in between tirelessly doing outstanding work. Were grateful for him. Gail McGovern, the President of the National Red Cross, which has contributed mightily to the rebuilding efforts here. Most of all, to the family and friends of all those whove been lost and all those whove been affected. Today we gather to celebrate the lives of those weve lost to the storms here in Joplin and across the Midwest, to keep in our prayers those still missing, to mourn with their families, to stand together during this time of pain and trial. And as Reverend Brown alluded to, the question that weighs on us at a time like this is: Why? Why our town? Why our home? Why my son, or husband, or wife, or sister, or friend? Why?", "filename": "29May2011SpeechattheMemorialforJoplinTornadoVictims.txt"}, {"question": "As the governor said, you have shown the world what it means to love thy neighbor. Youve banded together. Youve come to each others aid. Youve demonstrated a simple truth: that amid heartbreak and tragedy, no one is a stranger. Everybody is a brother. Everybody is a sister. We can all love one another. As you move forward in the days ahead, I know that rebuilding what youve lost wont be easy. I just walked through some of the neighborhoods that have been affected, and you look out at the landscape, and there have to be moments where you just say, where to begin? How to start?", "filename": "29May2011SpeechattheMemorialforJoplinTornadoVictims.txt"}, {"question": "Let me summarize just by saying that Im extraordinarily grateful for the cooperation of our state and local officials.  The conversations that Ive had with all the governors indicate that at this point there are no unmet needs.  I think everybody is taking this very seriously.  Weve gotten prepositioned all the resources that we need. But right now, the key is to make sure that the public is following instructions.  For those of you who still need additional information about how to respond, you can go to Ready.gov -- thats Ready.gov.  And that website should provide you with all the information that your family needs in terms of how you can prepare for this storm. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the people who are potentially affected.  We are extraordinarily grateful for our first responders, because theyre going to be working 24/7 around the clock, non-stop.  And I want to make sure that our thoughts and prayers go out to all those who may end up be dealing with a very difficult situation over the next several days. Last point Ill make, though -- this is going to be a big storm.  Its going to be a difficult storm.  The great thing about America is when we go through tough times like this we all pull together.  We look out for our friends.  We look out for our neighbors.  And we set aside whatever issues we may have otherwise to make sure that we respond appropriately and with swiftness.  And thats exactly what I anticipate is going to happen here. So I want to thank all the federal teams, state and local teams that are in place.  Im confident that were ready.  But I think the public needs to prepare for the fact that this is going to take a long time for us to clean up.  The good news is we will clean up and we will get through this. Question: What about the impact on the election, sir?", "filename": "29October2012StatementonHurricaneSandyAfterEmergencyTeamBriefings.txt"}, {"question": "Secretary James, for your service to our Air Force and to our nation. Governor Hickenlooper, Academy leaders, faculty and staff -- especially your outstanding Superintendent, Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson. And most of all, congratulations to the Class of 2016! As he prepares to conclude a remarkable 40-year career in the Air Force -- a career that started on this day 40 years ago  -- please join me in saluting someone who many of you look up to and whose counsel I've relied on as well -- Chief of Staff General Mark Welsh.  Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Mark, and thank you, Betty. And although hes not here today, I am proud to have nominated another Academy graduate -- and a combat-tested pilot  -- to serve as the 21st Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein. Cadets, you can take enormous pride in all the hard work that has brought you to this day.  I also ask you to give a big round of applause to all your moms and dads, grandparents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles who supported you and sacrificed for you so you could be here today. Give them another round of applause. Now, I have to tell you, some days I spend more time with the Air Force than my own family.  Especially on Air Force One.   You take good care of me.  You are always on time.  You never lose my luggage.  I don't have to take off my shoes before I get on.  So Im really going to miss Air Force One -- as well as the incredible Airmen that Ive come to know.  And that includes the pilots who flew me here -- Lieutenant Colonels Dan Thorn and Rob Tobler and Major Brett Ellis -- all three of them proud Air Force Academy graduates.  Give them a big round of applause. This Academy is one of our nations most selective academic institutions. Just being accepted is a big deal -- a testament to your talent and your leadership.  And we are particularly grateful to those of you with prior enlisted service, including Cameron Kistler, who deployed to Iraq -- Robert Parati and Clayton Logan, who deployed to Afghanistan.   We thank you.  Your country thanks you. Cadets, here you were tested by fire -- literally.  When you went through Beast, as General Johnson noted, Waldo Canyon was actually on fire. During Recognition, you ran to the Rock in a blizzard.  So you have more than earned your unofficial motto -- forged in fire and tempered in ice. Which is a great motto -- although it does sound like something out of Game of Thrones. And through it all, youve become like family.  You survived morning accountability formations, survived living in Sijan Hall.  That night in F-1 where you learned to earn each day.   You cheered Coach Calhoun and the Falcons as Ive welcomed them to the White House to present the Commander-in-Chief Trophy -- which Air Force has won a record 19 times. And I look out into your ranks and I see Airmen who will excel as pilots and engineers, analysts -- so many specialties.  The first cyber graduates in this Academys history.  And David Higgins, a marksman whos going to the Olympics in Rio -- bring home the gold, David!   No pressure. In you, I see men and women of integrity and service and excellence. And youve made us all proud.  And perhaps no one would have been more proud of your success than Major David Brodeur, whose sacrifice in Afghanistan we honor, and whose family joins us today -- 2016. Youve learned other lessons, as well, like what happens when you paint one of the planes on the Terrazo in your class color.   With such achievements in mind -- I hereby grant amnesty to all cadets serving restrictions and confinements for minor offenses.  Only minor. Today, we congratulate our newest Air Force officers.  On behalf of the American people, I thank you for choosing a life of service.  In the coming weeks, some of you will head to the chapel to get married.  In the years ahead, you and your families will serve around the world.  As officers, youll be responsible for the lives of those under your command, and youll be called upon to lead with wisdom, courage and compassion.  Thats what I want to talk with you about today. Ive served as Commander-in-Chief for nearly eight years now.  It has been the highest honor of my life to lead the greatest military in the history of the world.  It inspires me every day.   Today will be the last time that I have the honor of addressing a graduating class of military officers. And theres a debate going on in our country about our nations role in the world.  So, with that in mind, I hope you don't mind if I share some lessons Ive learned as Commander-in-Chief -- lessons that you may find useful as you lead those under your command, and as we work together to keep our nation strong and secure. First, as you look at the world, be guided by an honest and clear-eyed assessment.  Remember what you learned at this Academy -- the importance of evidence and facts and judgment.  And heres a fact:  The United States of America remains the most powerful nation on Earth and a force for good. We have big challenges in our country -- in our politics, our economy, our society.  Those are challenges we have to address.  But look around.  We have the worlds strongest economy.  Our scientists, our researchers, our entrepreneurs are global leaders in innovation.  Our colleges and universities attract the best talent from around the world.  Our values -- freedom, equality, opportunity -- those values inspire people everywhere, including immigrants who come here, ready to work, and integrate and help renew our country. Our standing in the world is higher.  I see it in my travels from Havana to Berlin to Ho Chi Minh City -- where huge crowds of Vietnamese lined the streets, some waving American flags.  So make no mistake, the United States is better positioned to lead in the 21st century than any other nation. And heres another fact:  Our military is, by a mile, the strongest in the world.   Yes, after two major ground wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, were drawing down the size of our Armed Forces, which is natural and necessary.  And we have to keep improving readiness and modernizing our force.  But it is undeniable -- our military is the most capable fighting force on the planet.  Its not close. Our soldiers are the best-trained, best-equipped land force on Earth, tested by years of combat, able to sustain power anywhere in the globe. Nobody can match our Army.  Our sailors serve on aircraft carriers that can go almost anywhere, and submarines that move undetected -- the largest and most lethal Navy in the world, on track to surpass 300 ships.  Nobody can match our Navy.  Our Marines are ready at a moments notice, first to fight or deliver help in a crisis, the worlds only truly global expeditionary force.  Nobody can match our Marines. Our Coast Guardsmen serve on the most advanced cutters in history, and special teams can shoot smugglers engines, hook and climb or repel aboard, protecting our shores.  Nobody can match our Coast Guard. And as for our Airmen -- with your unequaled vigilance and reach, unrivaled fifth-generation fighters, a new generation of remotely piloted aircraft pilots, astonishing precision that calls to mind your actual class motto, On Target, On Time -- nobody can match Americas Air Force. Not only that, no other nation brings its forces together like we do in one joint force, as we saw in an operation against ISIL in Syria just last year.  Air Force aircraft provided surveillance.  Navy F-18s provided close air support.  Army aviation assets delivered our Special Operators, an assault force of Marines and soldiers, to the target, and one of ISILs top leaders, Abu Sayyaf, was eliminated.  Thats the power of Americas military.   And we need to keep it that way. And heres one more fact as you go out into the world:  We are blessed to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous era in human history.  Now, that sounds controversial until you survey the history of the world.  Its hard to see, with all the violence and suffering in the world, and whats reported on the news every day.  But if you step back for a moment -- think about last week, when I was in Hiroshima to remember all who were lost in a World War that killed some 60 million people -- not 60,000, 60 million. For decades, there have been no wars between major powers.  Wars between nations are increasingly rare.  More people live in democracies. More than 1 billion people have been lifted from extreme poverty.  From the Americas to Africa to Southeast Asia, theres a new generation of young people, connected by technology and ready to make their mark. Ive met them.  They look up to America.  They aspire to be our partner. Thats the progress and the hope that we have to build on.  And so much of that derives from the extraordinary leadership and sacrifice of our Air Force and the other branches of our military. So we are well-positioned.  You enter this moment with a lot of good cards to play.  But we face serious threats.  Terrorist networks slaughter the innocent and plot attacks against our nation.  Civil wars like in Iraq tear countries apart and create humanitarian catastrophes and havens for terrorists.  Russian aggression against Ukraine, disputes in the South China Sea -- these are testing an international order that we built, where the sovereignty of nations is respected and all nations abide by the same rules.  Nuclear weapons, as in North Korea, and the specter of nuclear terrorism still threaten us all. So how to meet these threats while also seizing the incredible opportunities of this moment in history, thats going to be your challenge -- the challenge of your generation. Which leads me to a second lesson.  As we navigate this complex world, America cannot shirk the mantle of leadership.  We cant be isolationist.  Its not possible in this globalized, interconnected world.  In these uncertain times, its tempting sometimes to pull back and try to wash our hands of conflicts that seem intractable, let other countries fend for themselves.  But history teaches us, from Pearl Harbor to 9/11, that oceans alone cannot protect us.  Hateful ideologies can spark terror from Boston to San Bernardino. In a global economy, its not possible to stop trading goods and services with other countries.  Weak public health systems on the other side of the world allow diseases to develop that end up reaching our shores.  So we cannot turn inward.  We cannot give in to isolationism.  Thats a false comfort.  Allowing problems to fester over there makes us less secure here.  So, as Americans, we have to keep leading and working with others to build the security and prosperity and justice we want in the world. By the way, one of the most effective ways to lead and work with others is through treaties that advance our interests.  Lately, there's been a mindset in Congress that just about any international treaty is somehow a violation of American sovereignty, and so the Senate almost never approves treaties anymore.  They voted down a treaty to protect disabled Americans, including our veterans, while Senator and World War II veteran Bob Dole was sitting right there in the Senate chambers in a wheelchair. We don't always realize it, but treaties help make a lot of things in our lives possible that we take for granted -- from international phone calls to mail.  Those are good things.  Those are not a threat to our sovereignty.  I think we can all agree on that. But also from NATO to treaties controlling nuclear weapons, treaties help keep us safe.  So if were truly concerned about Chinas actions in the South China Sea, for example, the Senate should help strengthen our case by approving the Law of the Sea Convention -- as our military leaders have urged.  And by the way, these treaties are not a new thing. The power to make treaties is written into our Constitution.  Our Founding Fathers ratified lots of treaties.  So its time for the Senate to do its job and help us advance American leadership, rather than undermine it. A part of the reason this is so important is because the United States remains the one indisputable nation in world affairs.  I say this all the time.  After eight years, I have not gone to an international conference, summit, meeting where we were not the ones who made the agenda possible -- even if we werent hosting it.  We have more alliances with other countries than anybody else -- and theyre the foundation of global stability and prosperity.  On just about every issue, the world looks to us to set the agenda.  When theres a problem around the world, they do not call Beijing or Moscow -- they call us. And we lead not by dictating to other nations, but by working with them as partners; by treating other countries and their peoples with respect, not by lecturing them.  This isnt just the right thing to do; its in our self-interest.  It makes countries more likely to work with us, and, ultimately, it makes us more secure.  So we need smart, steady, principled American leadership. And part of leading wisely is seeing threats clearly.  Remember Ebola? That was a serious threat, and we took it seriously.  But in the midst of it, there was hysteria.  Flights must be banned!  Quarantine citizens! These were actual quotes.  Seal the border!  And my favorite -- Remove Obamaor millions of Americans die!  Thats an actual quote. The thing is, when we panic, we dont make good decisions.  So, with Ebola, instead of responding with fear, we responded with facts and responded with science and organization.  And thanks to a coordinated global response -- enabled by the American military and our medical workers who got in there first -- we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa and saved countless lives, and protected ourselves. So weve got to engage with the world.  We cant pull back. Of course, leading wisely also means resisting the temptation to intervene militarily every time theres a problem or crisis in the world.  History is littered with the ruins of empires and nations that overextended themselves, draining their power and influence.  And so we have to chart a smarter path.  As we saw in Vietnam and the Iraq War, oftentimes the greatest damage to American credibility comes when we overreach, when we dont think through the consequences of all of our actions.  And so we have to learn from our history.  And that also means were doing right by our men and women in uniform. So, cadets, in your positions of leadership, you will be called upon to sustain this balance -- to be hard-headed and big-hearted; guided by realism and idealism, even when these forces are sometimes at odds.  Weve got to have the realism to see the world as it is -- where sometimes uncomfortable compromises are necessary; where we have the humility to recognize that there are limits to what even a nation as powerful as ours can do; that there may be wars we cannot always stop right away, or lives we cannot save.  But we also need the idealism that sees the world as it ought to be -- a commitment to the universal values of democracy and equality and human rights, and a willingness to stand up for them around the world -- not just when its easy, but when its hard.  Because thats who we are and thats American leadership. At times, ensuring our security requires the use of military force.  Thats the third lesson I want to discuss.  As Commander-in-Chief, I have not hesitated to use force, unilaterally where necessary, to protect the American people.  Thanks to our military, intelligence and counterterrorism professionals, bin Laden is gone.  Anwar al-Awlaki, a leader of the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen, is gone.  Ahmed Abdi Godane, the al Qaeda leader in Somalia -- hes gone.  Ahmed Abu Khattala, accused in the attacks in Benghazi -- captured.  Mohammad Mansur, the leader of the Taliban -- gone.   Leader after leader in ISIL -- Haji Mutazz, their number two; Mohamed Emwazi, who brutally murdered Americans; Abu Nabil, the ISIL leader in Libya -- all gone.  Abu Dawud, a leader of their chemical weapons program -- captured. The list goes on.  Because if you target Americans, we will find you and justice will be done, and we will defend our nation. But even as we celebrate the courage of our troops who serve in war, even where we do not hesitate to act on behalf of our security, we should never celebrate war itself.  War, no matter how noble our intentions may be, promises agony and tragedy.  And no one knows this more than those who fight those wars -- our wounded warriors who bear the scars, seen and unseen; our veterans, who remember their fallen comrades; our Gold Star families, whose hearts ache with pride and with loss. We have a solemn responsibility to these Americans who sacrifice in our name.  We have a responsibility to be guided by intelligence, and not ideology, and to never rush into war, and to explore other options first. Because sending our troops into harms way must always be a last resort. And sometimes those decisions are tough.  I know, for example, that my decision not to conduct strikes against Syria after it used chemical weapons was controversial among some in Washington.  But because we seized a diplomatic option, backed by our threat of force, nations came together and we accomplished far more than military strikes ever could have -- all of Syrias declared chemical weapons were successfully removed. And in acting militarily, we have a responsibility, whenever possible, to build coalitions and partnerships.  There are times where we have to do it alone.  But on a whole lot of global problems, the United States shouldnt bear the entire burden of global security by itself.  Others have to step up.  Thats why, as we assist and train Afghan forces, were part of a 39-nation coalition.  Our coalition against ISIL includes 66 partners, including Arab nations.  Weve learned that often the best way to defeat terrorists is not by sending large numbers of American ground forces to occupy and patrol foreign cities and towns.  Its better to train and build up local partners -- theyre the ones who have to stabilize their own countries over the long term. Compared to when I came into office -- when we had nearly 180,000 American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq -- today that number is less than 15,000.  Most of our troops have come home.   Our local partners on the ground are in the lead.   And as ISIL continues to lose territory in Iraq and Syria, these terrorists are learning the same lesson as others before them -- you will never be strong enough to destroy America or our way of life.  You are going to lose.  But part of that is because were on the right side of history, and part of it is because we can mobilize others to work with us. When we use force, we have a responsibility to use it proportionally. Unlike terrorists who try to kill as many people as possible, the United States military goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid civilian casualties. Its the tragedy of war, however, whenever -- whether its conventional warfare or precision strikes -- that innocents sometimes are caught in the crossfire.  And these are deaths that haunt us all.  Nobody more than me.  As technology evolves, we can never grow numb to the consequences of our actions.  We have to hold ourselves to high standards, be even more transparent, and do everything in our power to prevent the loss of innocent life.  Thats how America goes to war.  And thats how, ultimately, America also wins the peace. And we have a responsibility to always give our troops a clear mission, the support they need to get the job done, and a plan for what comes after.  I insisted, for example, that our surge of forces in Afghanistan be matched with a transition to ensure Afghans took responsibility for their own security. In Libya, we were right to launch an air campaign to prevent Qaddafi from massacring innocent civilians, but we didnt do enough to plan for the day after, when deep-rooted tribalism plunged Libya into disorder. In Syria, the suffering in the civil war has been heartbreaking to see a nation shattered, and hundreds of thousands killed and millions driven from their homes.  It is gut-wrenching.  And as a father, I look at Syrias children and I see my own.  Thats why weve said the dictator, Assad, must go and why we support a moderate Syrian opposition.  And its why America provides more humanitarian aid to the Syrian people than any other nation. But suggestions for deeper U.S. military involvement in a conflict like the Syrian civil war have to be fully thought through, rigorously examined with an honest assessment of the risks and tradeoffs.  How will it alter the conflict?  What comes next?", "filename": "2June2016U.S.AirForceAcademyCommencementAddress.txt"}, {"question": "My fellow Americans, Mahalo! It is wonderful to be here at the White House Correspondents Dinner. What a week. As some of you heard, the state of Hawaii released my official long-form birth certificate. My fellow Americans, Mahalo! It is wonderful to be here at the White House Correspondents Dinner. What a week. As some of you heard, the state of Hawaii released my official long-form birth certificate. Hopefully this puts all doubts to rest. But just in case there are any lingering questions, tonight Im prepared to go a step further. Tonight, for the first time, I am releasing my official birth video. Now, I warn you -- no one has seen this footage in 50 years, not even me. But lets take a look. Oh, well. Back to square one. I want to make clear to the Fox News table: That was a joke. That was not my real birth video. That was a childrens cartoon. Call Disney if you don't believe me. They have the original long-form version. Anyway, its good to be back with so many esteemed guests. Celebrities. Senators. Journalists. Essential government employees. Non-essential government employees. You know who you are. I am very much looking forward to hearing Seth Meyers tonight. Hes a young, fresh face who can do no wrong in the eyes of his fans. Seth, enjoy it while it lasts. Yes, I think it is fair to say that when it comes to my presidency, the honeymoon is over. For example, some people now suggest that Im too professorial. And Id like to address that head-on, by assigning all of you some reading that will help you draw your own conclusions. Others say that I'm arrogant. But I've found a really great self-help tool for this: my poll numbers. Ive even let down my key core constituency: movie stars. Just the other day, Matt Damon -- I love Matt Damon, love the guy -- Matt Damon said he was disappointed in my performance. Well, Matt, I just saw The Adjustment Bureau, so -- right back atcha, buddy. Of course, theres someone who I can always count on for support: my wonderful wife Michelle. We made a terrific team at the Easter Egg Roll this week. Id give out bags of candy to the kids, and shed snatch them right back out of their little hands. Snatched them. And where is the National Public Radio table? You guys are still here? That's good. I couldnt remember where we landed on that. Now, I know you were a little tense when the GOP tried to cut your funding, but personally I was looking forward to new programming like No Things Considered -- or Wait, WaitDon't Fund Me. Of course, the deficit is a serious issue. That's why Paul Ryan couldnt be here tonight. His budget has no room for laughter. Michele Bachmann is here, though, I understand, and she is thinking about running for President, which is weird because I hear she was born in Canada. Yes, Michele, this is how it starts. Just letting you know. Tim Pawlenty? He seems all American. But have you heard his real middle name?  Tim Hosni Pawlenty? What a shame. My buddy, our outstanding ambassador, Jon Huntsman, is with us. Now, theres something you might not know about Jon. He didnt learn to speak Chinese to go there. Oh, no. He learned English to come here. And then theres a vicious rumor floating around that I think could really hurt Mitt Romney. I heard he passed universal health care when he was governor of Massachusetts. Someone should get to the bottom of that.   And I know just the guy to do it -- Donald Trump is here tonight! Now, I know that hes taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald.  And thats because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter - like, did we fake the moon landing?  What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac? But all kidding aside, obviously, we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience. For example -- no, seriously, just recently, in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice -- at the steakhouse, the mens cooking team cooking did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around. But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership. And so ultimately, you didnt blame Lil Jon or Meatloaf. You fired Gary Busey. And these are the kind of decisions that would keep me up at night. Well handled, sir. Well handled.  Say what you will about Mr. Trump, he certainly would bring some change to the White House. Lets see what weve got up there. So, yes, this has been quite a year in politics, but also in the movies. Many people, for instance, were inspired by the Kings Speech. Its a wonderful film. Well, some of you may not know this, but there's now a sequel in the works that touches close to home. And because this is a Hollywood crowd, tonight I can offer a sneak peek. So can we show the trailer, please? So, yes, this has been quite a year in politics, but also in the movies. Many people, for instance, were inspired by the Kings Speech. Its a wonderful film.

So can we show the trailer, please?", "filename": "30April2011WhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinnerSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Ed, because of that, you get the first question.  Congratulations. Question:  Thank you, sir, I really appreciate that.  And I hope we can go back to business and being mad at each other a little bit. President Obama:  I'm not mad at you. Question:  Okay, good.  Thank you, I appreciate that. President Obama:  You may be mad at me. Question:   I'm not.  A couple of questions on national security.  On Syria, you said that the red line was not just about chemical weapons being used but being spread, and it was a game-changer -- it seemed cut and dry.  And now your administration seems to be suggesting that line is not clear.  Do you risk U.S. credibility if you don't take military action? And then on Benghazi, there are some survivors of that terror attack who say they want to come forward and testify -- some in your State Department -- and they say theyve been blocked.  Will you allow them to testify? President Obama:  Well, first of all, on Syria, I think its important to understand that for several years now what we've been seeing is a slowly unfolding disaster for the Syrian people. And this is not a situation in which we've been simply bystanders to whats been happening.  My policy from the beginning has been that President Assad had lost credibility, that he attacked his own people, has killed his own people, unleashed a military against innocent civilians, and that the only way to bring stability and peace to Syria is going to be for Assad to step down and to move forward on a political transition. In pursuit of that strategy we've organized the international community.  We are the largest humanitarian donor. We have worked to strengthen the opposition.  We have provided nonlethal assistance to the opposition.  We have applied sanctions on Syria.  So there are a whole host of steps that we've been taking precisely because, even separate from the chemical weapons issue, whats happening in Syria is a blemish on the international community generally, and we've got to make sure that we're doing everything we can to protect the Syrian people. In that context, what I've also said is that the use of chemical weapons would be a game-changer not simply for the United States but for the international community. And the reason for that is that we have established international law and international norms that say when you use these kinds of weapons you have the potential of killing massive numbers of people in the most inhumane way possible, and the proliferation risks are so significant that we don't want that genie out of the bottle.  So when I said that the use of chemical weapons would be a game-changer, that wasnt unique to -- that wasnt a position unique to the United States and it shouldnt have been a surprise. And what we now have is evidence that chemical weapons have been used inside of Syria, but we don't know how they were used, when they were used, who used them. We don't have a chain of custody that establishes what exactly happened.  And when I am making decisions about Americas national security and the potential for taking additional action in response to chemical weapon use, I've got to make sure I've got the facts.  That's what the American people would expect. And if we end up rushing to judgment without hard, effective evidence, then we can find ourselves in a position where we can't mobilize the international community to support what we do.  There may be objections even among some people in the region who are sympathetic with the opposition if we take action.  So its important for us to do this in a prudent way. And what I've said to my team is we've got to do everything we can to investigate and establish with some certainty what exactly has happened in Syria, what is happening in Syria.  We will use all the assets and resources that we have at our disposal. We'll work with the neighboring countries to see whether we can establish a clear baseline of facts.  And we've also called on the United Nations to investigate. But the important point I want to make here is that we already are deeply engaged in trying to bring about a solution in Syria.  It is a difficult problem.  But even if chemical weapons were not being used in Syria, wed still be thinking about tens of thousands of people, innocent civilians -- women, children -- whove been killed by a regime thats more concerned about staying in power than it is about the well-being of its people. And so we are already deeply invested in trying to find a solution here. What is true, though, is, is that if I can establish in a way that not only the United States but also the international community feel confident is the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime, then that is a game-changer because what that portends is potentially even more devastating attacks on civilians, and it raises the strong possibility that those chemical weapons can fall into the wrong hands and get disseminated in ways that would threaten U.S. security or the security of our allies. Question:  By game-changer you mean U.S. military action? President Obama:  By game-changer I mean that we would have to rethink the range of options that are available to us. Now, were already, as Ive said, invested in trying to bring about a solution inside of Syria.  Obviously, there are options that are available to me that are on the shelf right now that we have not deployed.  And thats a spectrum of options.  As early as last year, I asked the Pentagon, our military, our intelligence officials to prepare for me what options might be available.  And I wont go into the details of what those options might be, but clearly that would be an escalation, in our view, of the threat to the security of the international community, our allies, and the United States, and that means that there are some options that we might not otherwise exercise that we would strongly consider. Question:  And on the Benghazi portion, I know pieces of this story have been litigated, youve been asked about it.  But there are people in your own State Department saying theyve been blocked from coming forward, that they survived the terror attack and they want to tell their story.  Will you help them come forward and just say it once and for all? President Obama:  Ed, Im not familiar with this notion that anybody has been blocked from testifying.  So what Ill do is I will find out what exactly youre referring to.  What Ive been very clear about from the start is that our job with respect to Benghazi has been to find out exactly what happened, to make sure that U.S. embassies not just in the Middle East but around the world are safe and secure, and to bring those who carried it out to justice. But I'll find out what exactly you're referring to. Question:  They've hired an attorney because they're saying that they've been blocked from coming forward. President Obama:  I'm not familiar with it. Jessica. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  There's a report that your Director of National Intelligence has ordered a broad review -- this is regards to the Boston Marathon bombing -- that your DNI has ordered a broad review of all the intelligence-gathering prior to the attack.  There is also a series of senators -- Susan Collins, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham -- who allege that all these years after 9/11, there still wasn't enough intelligence shared prior to the attack.  And now, Lindsey Graham, who is a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, has said that Benghazi and Boston are both examples of the U.S. going backwards on national security.  Is he right?  And did our intelligence miss something? President Obama:  No, Mr. Graham is not right on this issue, although I'm sure generated some headlines. I think that what we saw in Boston was state, local, federal officials, every agency rallying around a city that had been attacked -- identifying the perpetrators just hours after the scene had been examined.  We now have one individual deceased, one in custody.  Charges have been brought. I think that all our law enforcement officials performed in an exemplary fashion after the bombing had taken place.  And we should be very proud of their work, as obviously we're proud of the people of Boston and all the first responders and the medical personnel that helped save lives. What we also know is that the Russian intelligence services had alerted U.S. intelligence about the older brother, as well as the mother, indicating that they might be sympathizers to extremists.  The FBI investigated that older brother.  It's not as if the FBI did nothing.  They not only investigated the older brother, they interviewed the older brother.  They concluded that there were no signs that he was engaging in extremist activity.  So that much we know. And the question then is was there something that happened that triggered radicalization and an actual decision by the brother to engage in the tragic attack we actually saw in Boston, and are there additional things that could have been done in that interim that might have prevented it. Now, what Director Clapper is doing is standard procedure around here, which is when an event like this happens we want to go back and we want to review every step that was taken.  We want to leave no stone unturned.  We want to see, is there, in fact, additional protocols and procedures that could be put in place that would further improve and enhance our ability to detect a potential attack?  And we won't know that until that review is completed.  We won't know that until the investigation of the actual crime is fully completed.  And that's still ongoing. But what I can say is that based on what I've seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it was supposed to be doing. But this is hard stuff.  And Ive said for quite some time that because of the pressure that we put on al Qaeda core, because of the pressure that weve put on these networks that are well-financed and more sophisticated and can engage in and project transnational threats against the United States, one of the dangers that we now face are self-radicalized individuals who are already here in the United States -- in some cases, may not be part of any kind of network, but because of whatever warped, twisted ideas they may have, may decide to carry out an attack.  And those are in some ways more difficult to prevent. And so what Ive done for months now is to indicate to our entire counterterrorism team, what more can we do on that threat that is looming on the horizon?  Are there more things that we can do, whether its engaging with communities where theres a potential for self-radicalization of this sort?  Is there work that can be done in terms of detection?  But all of this has to be done in the context of our laws, due process. And so part of what Director Clapper is doing, then, is going to be to see if we can determine any lessons learned from what happened. Question:  Are you getting all the intelligence and information you need from the Russians? And should Americans be worried when they go to big, public events now? President Obama:  The Russians have been very cooperative with us since the Boston bombing.  Obviously, old habits die hard; there are still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10, 20, 30 years, back to the Cold War.  But theyre continually improving.  Ive spoken to President Putin directly.  Hes committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation, but how do we work on counterterrorism issues generally. In terms of the response of the American people, I think everybody can take a cue from Boston.  You dont get a sense that anybody is intimidated when they go to Fenway Park a couple days after the bombing.  There are joggers right now, I guarantee you, all throughout Boston and Cambridge and Watertown.  And I think one of the things that Ive been most proud of in watching the countrys response to the terrible tragedy there, is a sense of resilience and toughness, and were not going to be intimidated. We are going to live our lives. And people, I think, understand that weve got to do everything we can to prevent these kinds of attacks from taking place, but people also understand -- in the same way they understand after a shooting in Aurora or Newtown or Virginia Tech, or after the foiled attempts in Times Square or in Detroit -- that were not going to stop living our lives because warped, twisted individuals try to intimidate us.  Were going to do what we do -- which is go to work, raise our kids, go to ball games, run in marathons.  And at the same time, were going to make sure that everybody is cooperating and is vigilant in doing everything we can, without being nave, to try to prevent these attacks from happening in the future. Jonathan Karl. Question:  Mr. President, you are a hundred days into your second term.  On the gun bill, you put, it seems, everything into it to try to get it passed.  Obviously, it didnt. Congress has ignored your efforts to try to get them to undo these sequester cuts. Theres even a bill that you threatened to veto that got 92 Democrats in the House voting yes.  So my question to you is do you still have the juice to get the rest of your agenda through this Congress? President Obama:  If you put it that way, Jonathan -- maybe I should just pack up and go home.  Golly. I think its a little -- as Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point. We understand that were in a divided government right now. The Republicans control the House of Representatives.  In the Senate, this habit of requiring 60 votes for even the most modest piece of legislation has gummed up the works there.  And I think it comes as no surprise not even to the American people, but even members of Congress themselves that right now things are pretty dysfunctional up on Capitol Hill. Despite that, Im actually confident that there are a range of things that were going to be able to get done.  I feel confident that the bipartisan work thats been done on immigration reform will result in a bill that passes the Senate, passes the House, and gets on my desk.  And thats going to be a historic achievement.  And Ive been very complimentary of the efforts of both Republicans and Democrats in those efforts. It is true that the sequester is in place right now.  Its damaging our economy.  Its hurting our people.  And we need to lift it.  Whats clear is, is that the only way were going to lift it is if we do a bigger deal that meets the test of lowering our deficit and growing our economy at the same time.  And thats going to require some compromises on the part of both Democrats and Republicans. Ive had some good conversations with Republican senators so far.  Those conversations are continuing.  I think theres a genuine desire on many of their parts to move past not only sequester but Washington dysfunction.  Whether we can get it done or not, well see. But I think the sequester is a good example -- or this recent FAA issue is a good example.  You will recall that even as recently as my campaign, Republicans were saying, sequester is terrible, this is a disaster, its going to ruin our military, its going to be disastrous for the economy -- we've got to do something about it.  Then, when it was determined that doing something about it might mean that we close some tax loopholes for the wealthy and the well-connected, suddenly, well, you know what, well take the sequester.  And the notion was somehow that we had exaggerated the effects of the sequester -- remember?  The President is crying wolf.  Hes Chicken Little.  The sequester -- no problem. And then in rapid succession, suddenly White House tours -- this is terrible!  How can we let that happen?  Meat inspectors  -- weve got to fix that.  And, most recently, what are we going to do about potential delays at airports? So despite the fact that a lot of members of Congress were suggesting that somehow the sequester was a victory for them and this wouldnt hurt the economy, what we now know is what I warned earlier, what Jay stood up here and warned repeatedly, is happening.  Its slowed our growth.  Its resulting in people being thrown out of work. And its hurting folks all across the country. And the fact that Congress responded to the short-term problem of flight delays by giving us the option of shifting money thats designed to repair and improve airports over the long term to fix the short-term problem -- well, thats not a solution.  And essentially what weve done is weve said, in order to avoid delays this summer, were going to ensure delays for the next two or three decades. Question:  Whyd you go along with it? President Obama:  Hold on a second. So the alternative, of course, is either to go ahead and impose a whole bunch of delays on passengers now -- which also does not fix the problem -- or the third alternative is to actually fix the problem by coming up with a broader, larger deal. But, Jonathon, you seem to suggest that somehow these folks over there have no responsibilities and that my job is to somehow get them to behave.  Thats their job. Theyre elected -- members of Congress are elected in order to do whats right for their constituencies and for the American people. So if, in fact, they are seriously concerned about passenger convenience and safety, then they shouldnt just be thinking about tomorrow or next week or the week after that; they should be thinking about whats going to happen five years from now, 10 years from now, or 15 years from now.  The only way to do that is for them to engage with me on coming up with a broader deal.  And thats exactly what Im trying to do -- is to continue to talk to them about are there ways for us to fix this. Frankly, I dont think that if I were to veto, for example, this FAA bill, that that somehow would lead to the broader fix.  It just means that there would be pain now, which they would try to blame on me, as opposed to pain five years from now.  But either way, the problem is not getting fixed. The only way the problem does get fixed is if both parties sit down and they say: How are we going to make sure that we're reducing our deficit sensibly?  How are we making sure that we're investing in things like rebuilding our airports and our roads and our bridges, and investing in early childhood education, basic research -- all the things that are going to help us grow? And that's what the American people want. Just one interesting statistic when it comes to airports.  There was a recent survey of the top airports in the country -- in the world, and there was not a single U.S. airport that came in the top 25.  Not one.  Not one U.S. airport was considered by the experts and consumers who use these airports to be in the top 25 in the world.  I think Cincinnati Airport came in around 30th. What does that say about our long-term competitiveness and future?  And so when folks say, well, there was some money in the FAA to deal with these furloughs -- well, yeah, the money is this pool of funds that are supposed to try to upgrade our airports so we don't rank in the bottom of industrialized countries when it comes to our infrastructure. And that's what we're doing -- we're using our seed corn short term.  And the only reason we're doing it is because right now we've got folks who are unwilling to make some simple changes to our tax code, for example, to close loopholes that aren't adding to our competitiveness and aren't helping middle-class families. So that's a long way of answering your question, but the point is that there are common-sense solutions to our problems right now.  I cannot force Republicans to embrace those common-sense solutions.  I can urge them to.  I can put pressure on them.  I can rally the American people around those common-sense solutions.  But ultimately, they, themselves, are going to have to say, we want to do the right thing. And I think there are members certainly in the Senate right now, and I suspect members in the House as well, who understand that deep down.  But they're worried about their politics.  Its tough.  Their base thinks that compromise with me is somehow a betrayal.  Theyre worried about primaries.  And I understand all that.  And we're going to try to do everything we can to create a permission structure for them to be able to do whats going to be best for the country.  But its going to take some time. Bill Plante. Question:  Mr. President, as youre probably aware, theres a growing hunger strike on Guantanamo Bay among prisoners there.  Is it any surprise really that they would prefer death rather than have no end in sight to their confinement? President Obama:  Well, it is not a surprise to me that we've got problems in Guantanamo, which is why when I was campaigning in 2007 and 2008, and when I was elected in 2008, I said we need to close Guantanamo.  I continue to believe that we've got to close Guantanamo. Question:  -- can do it? President Obama:  Well, I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. It is expensive.  It is inefficient.  It hurts us in terms of our international standing.  It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts.  It is a recruitment tool for extremists.  It needs to be closed. Now, Congress determined that they would not let us close it -- and despite the fact that there are a number of the folks who are currently in Guantanamo who the courts have said could be returned to their country of origin or potentially a third country. I'm going to go back at this.  I've asked my team to review everything that's currently being done in Guantanamo, everything that we can do administratively.  And I'm going to reengage with Congress to try to make the case that this is not something that's in the best interest of the American people.  And it's not sustainable. The notion that we're going to continue to keep over a hundred individuals in a no-man's land in perpetuity, even at a time when we've wound down the war in Iraq, we're winding down the war in Afghanistan, we're having success defeating al Qaeda core, we've kept the pressure up on all these transnational terrorist networks, when we've transferred detention authority in Afghanistan -- the idea that we would still maintain forever a group of individuals who have not been tried, that is contrary to who we are, it is contrary to our interests, and it needs to stop. Now, it's a hard case to make because I think for a lot of Americans the notion is out of sight, out of mind.  And it's easy to demagogue the issue.  That's what happened the first time this came up.  I'm going to go back at it because I think it's important. Question:  Meanwhile we continue to force-feed these folks -- President Obama:  I don't want these individuals to die.  Obviously, the Pentagon is trying to manage the situation as best as they can.  But I think all of us should reflect on why exactly are we doing this?  Why are we doing this?  We've got a whole bunch of individuals who have been tried who are currently in maximum security prisons around the country.  Nothing has happened to them.  Justice has been served.  It's been done in a way that's consistent with our Constitution, consistent with due process, consistent with rule of law, consistent with our traditions. The individual who attempted to bomb Times Square -- in prison, serving a life sentence.  The individual who tried to bomb a plane in Detroit -- in prison, serving a life sentence.  A Somali who was part of Al-Shabaab, who we captured -- in prison. So we can handle this. And I understand that in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, with the traumas that had taken place, why, for a lot of Americans, the notion was somehow that we had to create a special facility like Guantanamo and we couldnt handle this in a normal, conventional fashion.  I understand that reaction.  But were now over a decade out. We should be wiser.  We should have more experience in how we prosecute terrorists. And this is a lingering problem that is not going to get better.  Its going to get worse.  Its going to fester.  And so Im going to, as I said before, examine every option that we have administratively to try to deal with this issue, but ultimately were also going to need some help from Congress, and Im going to ask some folks over there who care about fighting terrorism but also care about who we are as a people to step up and help me on it. Chuck Todd. Question:  Mr. President, thank you.  Max Baucus, Democratic Senator, referred to the implementation as your health care law as a potential train wreck.  And other Democrats have been whispering nervousness about the implementation and the impact -- and its all self-centered a little bit -- the impact that it might have on their own political campaigns in 2014.  Why do you think -- just curious -- why does Senator Baucus, somebody who ostensibly helped write your bill, believe that this is going to be a train wreck?  And why do you believe hes wrong? President Obama:  Well, I think that any time youre implementing something big, theres going to be people who are nervous and anxious about is it going to get done, until its actually done. But lets just step back for a second and make sure the American people understand what it is that were doing.  The Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- has now been with us for three years.  Its gone through Supreme Court tests.  Its gone through efforts to repeal.  A huge chunk of it has already been implemented.  And for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, theyre already experiencing most of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act even if they dont know it. Their insurance is more secure.  Insurance companies cant drop them for bad reasons.  Their kids are able to stay on their health insurance until theyre 26 years old.  Theyre getting free preventive care. So there are a whole host of benefits that, for the average American out there, for the 85 to 90 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, this thing has already happened.  And their only impact is that their insurance is stronger, better, more secure than it was before.  Full stop.  Thats it.  They dont have to worry about anything else. The implementation issues come in for those who dont have health insurance -- maybe because they have a preexisting condition and the only way they can get health insurance is to go out on the individual market, and theyre paying 50 percent or 100 percent more than those of us who are lucky enough to have group plans; people who are too poor to get health insurance and the employers dont offer them. Maybe they work for a small business and this small business cant afford right now to provide health insurance. So all the implementation issues that are coming up are implementation issues related to that small group of people, 10 to 15 percent of Americans -- now, its still 30 million Americans, but a relatively narrow group -- who dont have health insurance right now, or are on the individual market and are paying exorbitant amounts for coverage that isnt that great. And what were doing is were setting up a pool so that they can all pool together and get a better deal from insurance companies.  And those who cant afford it, were going to provide them with some subsidies.  Thats it.  I mean, thats whats left to implement, because the other stuff has been implemented and its working fine. The challenge is that setting up a market-based system, basically an online marketplace where you can go on and sign up and figure out what kind of insurance you can afford and figuring out how to get the subsidies -- thats still a big, complicated piece of business.  And when youre doing it nationwide, relatively fast, and youve got half of Congress who is determined to try to block implementation and not adequately funding implementation, and then youve got a number of members of -- or governors -- Republican governors -- who know that its bad politics for them to try to implement this effectively, and some even who have decided to implement it and then their Republican-controlled state legislatures say, dont implement, and wont pass enabling legislation -- when you have that kind of situation, that makes it harder. But having said all that, weve got a great team in place.  We are pushing very hard to make sure that were hitting all the deadlines and the benchmarks. Ill give you an example, a recent example.  We put together, initially, an application form for signing up for participation in the exchanges that was initially about 21 pages long, and immediately everybody sat around the table and said, well, this is too long. Especially in this age of the Internet, people arent going to have the patience to sit there for hours on end.  Lets streamline this thing.  So we cut what was a 21-page form now down to a form thats about three pages for an individual, a little more than that for a family -- well below the industry average.  So those kinds of refinements were going to continue to be working on. But I think the main message I want to give to the American people here is, despite all the hue and cry and sky is falling predictions about this stuff, if youve already got health insurance, then that part of Obamacare that affects you, its pretty much already in place.  And thats about 85 percent of the country. What is left to be implemented is those provisions to help the 10 to 15 percent of the American public that is unlucky enough that they dont have health insurance.  And by the way, some of you who have health insurance right now, at some point you may lose your health insurance, and if youve got a preexisting condition, this structure will make sure that you are not left vulnerable. But its still a big undertaking.  And what were doing is making sure that every single day we are constantly trying to hit our marks so that it will be in place. And the last point Ill make -- even if we do everything perfectly, there will still be glitches and bumps, and there will be stories that can be written that say, oh, look, this thing is not working the way its supposed to, and this happened and that happened.  And thats pretty much true of every government program thats ever been set up.  But if we stay with it and we understand what our long-term objective is -- which is making sure that in a country as wealthy as ours, nobody should go bankrupt if they get sick, and that we would rather have people getting regular checkups than going to the emergency room because they dont have health care -- if we keep that in mind, then were going to be able to drive down costs; were going to be able to improve efficiencies in the system; were going to be able to see people benefit from better health care.  And that will save the country money as a whole over the long term. Question:  Do you believe, without the cooperation of a handful of governors, particularly large states like Florida and Texas, that you can fully implement this? President Obama::  I think its harder.  Theres no doubt about it. Question:  But can you do it without them? President Obama:  We will implement it.  There will be -- we have a backup federal exchange.  If states arent cooperating, we set up a federal exchange so that people can access that federal exchange. But, yes, it puts more of a burden on us.  And its ironic, since all these folks say that they believe in empowering states, that theyre going to end up having the federal government do something that wed actually prefer states to do if they were properly cooperating. Lets see how were doing on time here.  Last question.  Antonieta Cadiz -- wheres Antonieta?  There you are.  Tell those big guys to get out of your way. Question:  Thank you, Mr. President.  Two questions.  There are concerns about how the immigration bill from the House has complicated chances for immigration reform in the Senate.  It seems to be a more conservative proposal.  Is there room for a more conservative proposal than the one presented in the Senate? Thats immigration. Second, on Mexico -- yesterday, the Mexican government said all contact with the U.S. law enforcement will now go through a single door, the Federal Interior Ministry.  Is this change good for the U.S. relationship with Mexico?  Do you think the level of security and cooperation can be maintained? President Obama:  On immigration reform, Ive been impressed by the work that was done by the Gang of Eight in the Senate.  The bill that they produced is not the bill that I would have written, there are elements of it that I would change, but I do think that it meets the basic criteria that I laid out from the start, which is:  Weve got to have more effective border security -- although it should build on the great improvements that have been made on border security over the last four to five years.  We should make sure that we are cracking down on employers that are gaming the system.  We should make the legal immigration system work more effectively so that the waits are not as burdensome, the bureaucracy is not as complicated, so that we can continue to attract the best and the brightest from around the world to our shores in a legal fashion.  And we want to make sure that weve got a pathway to citizenship that is tough, but allows people to earn over time their legal status here in this country. And the Senate bill meets those criteria -- in some cases not in the way that I would, but it meets those basic criteria.  And I think its a testament to the senators that were involved that they made some tough choices and made some tough compromises in order to hammer out that bill. Now, I havent seen what members of the House are yet proposing.  And maybe they think that they can answer some of those questions differently or better.  And I think weve got to be open-minded in seeing what they come up with.  The bottom line, though, is, is that theyve still got to meet those basic criteria:  Is it making the border safer?  Is it dealing with employers in how they work with the government to make sure that people are not being taken advantage of, or taking advantage of the system?  Are we improving our legal immigration system?  And are we creating a pathway for citizenship for the 11 million or so who are undocumented in this country? And if they meet those criteria but theyre slightly different than the Senate bill, then I think that we should be able to come up with an appropriate compromise.  If it doesnt meet those criteria, then I will not support such a bill.  So well have to wait and see. When it comes to Mexico, Im very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico to see the new President, Pea Nieto.  I had a chance to meet him here, but this will be the first, more extensive consultations and it will be an opportunity for his ministers, my Cabinet members who are participating to really hammer out some of these issues. A lot of the focus is going to be on economics.  Weve spent so much time on security issues between the United States and Mexico that sometimes I think we forget this is a massive trading partner responsible for huge amounts of commerce and huge numbers of jobs on both sides of the border.  We want to see how we can deepen that, how we can improve that and maintain that economic dialogue over a long period of time. That doesnt mean that were not going to be talking about security.  I think that in my first conversation with the President, he indicated to me that he very much continues to be concerned about how we can work together to deal with transnational drug cartels.  Weve made great strides in the coordination and cooperation between our two governments over the last several years.  But my suspicion is, is that things can be improved. And some of the issues that hes talking about really had to do with refinements and improvements in terms of how Mexican authorities work with each other, how they coordinate more effectively, and it has less to do with how they're dealing with us, per se.  So Im not going to yet judge how this will alter the relationship between the United States and Mexico until Ive heard directly from them to see what exactly are they trying to accomplish. But, overall, what I can say is that my impression is, is that the new President is serious about reform.  Hes already made some tough decisions.  I think hes going to make more that will improve the economy and security of Mexican citizens, and that will improve the bilateral relationship as well. And I don't want to leave out that were also going to be talking to, during my visit to Costa Rica, Presidents of Central American countries, many of whom are struggling with both economic issues and security issues, but are important partners for us -- because I think that the vision here is that we want to make sure that our hemisphere is more effectively integrated to improve the economy and security of all people. That's good for the United States.  That will enhance our economy.  That can improve our energy independence. There are a whole range of opportunities, and that's going to be the purpose of this trip.  And Im sure that those of you who will have the chance to travel with me well have a chance to discuss this further. All right?  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you, guys. Question:  Jason Collins?  Do you want to say anything about it? President Obama:  Yes, Ill say something about Jason Collins.  I had a chance to talk to him yesterday.  He seems like a terrific young man.  And I told him I couldnt be prouder of him. One of the extraordinary measures of progress that weve seen in this country has been the recognition that the LGBT community deserves full equality -- not just partial equality, not just tolerance, but a recognition that they're fully a part of the American family. And given the importance of sports in our society, for an individual who has excelled at the highest levels in one of the major sports to go ahead and say, this is who I am, Im proud of it, Im still a great competitor, Im still seven foot tall and can bang with Shaq -- and deliver a hard foul -- and for I think a lot of young people out there who are gay or lesbian who are struggling with these issues, to see a role model like that who is unafraid, I think its a great thing. And I think America should be proud that this is just one more step in this ongoing recognition that we treat everybody fairly, and everybody is part of a family, and we judge people on the basis of their character and their performance and not their sexual orientation.  So Im very proud of him. All right?", "filename": "30April2013PressQ&AonSyriaandSundryTopics.txt"}, {"question": "Good evening, everybody. Everybody: Good evening. It is an honor to be here at my last -- and perhaps the last -- White House Correspondents' Dinner. You all look great. The end of the Republic has never looked better! I do apologize. I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on \"CPT\" -- which stands for \"Jokes That White People Should Not Make.\" It's a tip for you, Jeff [Mason]. Mason: Got it. President Obama: Anyway! Here we are. My eighth and final appearance at this unique event.  And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. Earn me some serious Tubmans. That's right. My brilliant and beautiful wife, Michelle, is here tonight. She looks so happy to be here.  That's called practice -- it's like learning to do three-minute planks.  She makes it look easy now. Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot, and it's anyone's guess who she will be.  But standing here, I can't help but be reflective, a little sentimental. Eight years ago, I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. Eight years ago, I was a young man, full of idealism and vigor, and look at me now.  I am gray and grizzled, just counting down the days 'til my death panel.  Hillary once questioned whether I'd be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call -- now I'm awake anyway because I've got to go to the bathroom. I'm up. In fact, somebody recently said to me, \"Mr. President, you are so yesterday. Justin Trudeau has completely replaced you: He's so handsome; he's so charming; he's the future.\" And I said, \"Justin, just give it a rest.\"  I resented that. Meanwhile, Michelle has not aged a day.  The only way you can date her in photos is by looking at me. Take a look. Here we are in 2008. Here we are a few years later. And this one is from two weeks ago. So time passes.  In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat-out reject my authority.  And Republican leaders won't take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting used to, it's really going to -- it's a curve ball. I don't know what to do with it. Of course, in fact, for months now congressional Republicans have been saying there are things I cannot do in my final year. Unfortunately, this dinner was not one of them.  But on everything else, it's another story. And you know who you are, Republicans. In fact, I think we've got Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner, they're in the house, which reminds me -- Security, bar the doors!  Judge Merrick Garland, come on out, we're going to do this right here, right now.  It's like \"The Red Wedding.\" But it's not just Congress. Even some foreign leaders, they've been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face.  A clear breach in protocol.  Although while in England I did have lunch with Her Majesty, the Queen, took in a performance of Shakespeare, hit the links with David Cameron. (Just in case anybody is still debating whether I'm black enough, I think that settles the debate.) I won't lie -- look, this is a tough transition. It's hard. Key staff are now starting to leave the White House. Even reporters have left me: Savannah Guthrie, she's left the White House Press Corps to host the Today show. Norah O'Donnell left the briefing room to host CBS This Morning. Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN. But the prospect of leaving the White House is a mixed bag. You might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give Secret Service credit -- they found Michelle, brought her back; she's safe back at home now.  It's only nine more months, baby. Settle down. And yet, somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year, my approval ratings keep going up.  The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major. And here's the thing: I haven't really done anything differently. So it's odd. Even my aides can't explain the rising poll numbers -- what has changed, nobody can figure it out. Puzzling.... Anyway, in this last year I do have more appreciation for those who have been with me on this amazing ride, like one of our finest public servants, Joe Biden. God bless him. Love that guy.  I love Joe Biden -- I really do. And I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face.  Thank you, Joe. Also, I would be remiss -- let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore.  Also known as one of the two black guys [along with Trevor Noah] who is not Jon Stewart.  You're the South African guy, right?  I love Larry. And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which is a great town. I also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight. Rachel McAdams. Mark Ruffalo. Liev Schreiber.  Thank you all for everything that you've done.  I'm just joking. As you know, Spotlight is a film, a movie about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since Star Wars.  Look -- that was maybe a cheap shot. I understand the news business is tough these days, it keeps changing all the time. Every year at this dinner, somebody makes a joke about BuzzFeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year, the Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard.  Kind of a silence there.  Especially at the Washington Post table. GOP Chairman Reince Priebus is here as well.  Glad to see you that you feel that you've earned a night off.  Congratulations on all your success. The Republican Party, the nomination process - it's all going great. Keep it up. Kendall Jenner is also here. And we had a chance to meet her backstage -- she seems like a very nice young woman. I'm not exactly sure what she does, but I am told that my Twitter mentions are about to go through the roof. Helen Mirren is here tonight.  I don't even have a joke here. I just think Helen Mirren is awesome.  She's awesome. Sitting at the same table, I see Mike Bloomberg.  Mike, a combative, controversial New York billionaire is leading the GOP primary and it is not you.  That's has to sting a little bit.  Although it's not an entirely fair comparison between you and The Donald. After all, Mike was a big-city mayor. He knows policy in depth. And he's actually worth the amount of money that he says he is. What an election season. For example, we've got the bright new face of the Democratic Party here tonight - Mr. Bernie Sanders!  There he is -- Bernie!  Bernie, you look like a million bucks.  Or to put it in terms you'll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of 27 dollars each. A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially his appeal to young people. But not me, I get it. Just recently, a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man this year.  That was not going to happen.  Bernie might have let her go.  Not us. I am hurt, though, Bernie, that you've distancing yourself a little from me.  I mean, that's just not something that you do to your comrade. Bernie's slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people. \"Feel the Bern.\"  Feel the Bern -- it's a good slogan. Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this. Look, I've said how much I admire Hillary's toughness, her smarts, her policy chops, her experience. You've got to admit it, though, Hillary trying to appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative just signed up for Facebook:  \"Dear America, did you get my poke?\"  \"Is it appearing on your wall?\"  \"I'm not sure I am using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.\"  It's not entirely persuasive. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, things are a little more -- How should we say this? -- a little more \"loose.\" Just look at the confusion over the invitations to tonight's dinner. Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish, but instead, a whole bunch of you wrote in: Paul Ryan.  That's not an option, people. Steak or fish.  You may not like steak or fish -- but that's your choice. Meanwhile, some candidates aren't polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. The rules were well-established ahead of time. And then there's Ted Cruz. Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana - Hoosier country - stood on a basketball court, and called the hoop a \"basketball ring.\"  What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats?  But sure, I'm the foreign one. Well, let me conclude tonight on a more serious note. I want to thank the Washington press corps, I want to thank Carol for all that you do. The free press is central to our democracy, and -- nah, I'm just kidding! You know I've got to talk about Trump! Come on!  We weren't just going to stop there. Come on. Although I am a little hurt that he's not here tonight. We had so much fun the last time.  And it is surprising. You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras, and he says no?  Is this dinner too tacky for The Donald?  What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home, eating a Trump Steak -- tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel?  What's he doing?", "filename": "30April2016WhiteHouseCorrespondentsDinnerSpeech.txt"}, {"question": "Let me, first of all, thank Commander Foster for your introduction and for your lifetime of service to your fellow Marines, soldiers and veterans. On behalf of us all, I want to thank Jimmie and I want to thank your entire leadership team for welcoming me here today. Thank you very much. Your National Adjutant, Dan Wheeler; your Executive Director, your voice in Washington, Peter Gaytan, who does just an extraordinary job; and the President of the American Legion Auxiliary, Carlene Ashworth -- thank you for your extraordinary service. To Rehta Foster and all the spouses, daughters and sisters of the Auxiliary, and the Sons of the American Legion -- as military families, you also serve, and we salute all of you as well. There are some special guests here I want to acknowledge. They may have already been acknowledged, but they're great friends so I want to make sure that I point them out. First of all, the wonderful governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, is here. Two senators who are working on behalf of veterans every single day -- Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken. Congressman Keith Ellison -- this is his district. Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak, a great friend. To all the other members of Congress and Minnesota elected officials who are here, welcome. It is wonderful to be back with the American Legion. Back in Illinois, my home state -- Hey! Illinois is in the house. We worked together to make sure veterans across the state were getting the benefits they had earned. When I was in the U.S. Senate, we worked together to spotlight the tragedy of homelessness among veterans -- and the need to end it. As President, Ive welcomed Jimmie and your leadership to the Oval Office to hear directly from you. And I have been -- I've been honored to have you by my side when I signed advance appropriations to protect veterans' health care from the budget battles in Washington, -- when I signed legislation to give new support to veterans and their caregivers, and, most recently, when I proposed new initiatives to make sure the private sector is hiring our talented veterans. So, American Legion, I thank you for your partnership. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you today about what we need to do to make sure America is taking care of our veterans as well as youve taken care of us. And Im grateful to be with you for another reason. A lot of our fellow citizens are still reeling from Hurricane Irene and its aftermath. Folks are surveying the damage. Some are dealing with tremendous flooding. As a government, were going to make sure that states and communities have the support they need so their folks can recover. And across the nation, were still digging out from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Its taking longer and it's been more difficult than any of us had imagined. And even though weve taken some steps in the right direction, we've got a lot more to do. Our economy has to grow faster. We have to create more jobs, and we have to do it faster. And most of all, we've got to break the gridlock in Washington thats been preventing us from taking the action we need to get this country moving. Thats why, next week, Ill be speaking to the nation about a plan to create jobs and reduce our deficit -- a plan that I want to see passed by Congress. We've got to get this done. And heres what else I know. We Americans have been through tough times before, much tougher than these. And we didnt just get through them; we emerged stronger than before. Not by luck. Not by chance. But because, in hard times, Americans dont quit. We dont give up. We summon that spirit that says, when we come together, when we choose to move forward together, as one people, theres nothing we cant achieve. And, Legionnaires, you know this story because it's the story of your lives. And in times like these, all Americans can draw strength from your example. When Hitler controlled a continent and fascism appeared unstoppable, when our harbor was bombed and our Pacific fleet crippled, there were those that declared that the United States had been reduced to a third-class power. But you, our veterans of World War II, crossed the oceans and stormed the beaches and freed the millions, liberated the camps and showed the United States of America is the greatest force for freedom that the world has ever known. When North Korea invaded the South, pushing the allied forces into a tiny sliver of territory -- the Pusan Perimeter -- it seemed like the war could be lost. But you, our Korean War veterans, pushed back, fought on, year after bloody year. And this past Veterans Day, I went to Seoul and joined our Korean War veterans for the 60th anniversary of that war, and we marked that milestone in a free and prosperous Republic of Korea, one of our greatest allies. When communist forces in Vietnam unleashed the Tet Offensive, it fueled the debate here at home that raged over that war. You, our Vietnam veterans, did not always receive the respect that you deserved -- which was a national shame. But let it be remembered that you won every major battle of that war. Every single one. As President, Ive been honored to welcome our Vietnam veterans to the White House and finally present them with the medals and recognition that they had earned. Its been a chance to convey, on behalf of the American people, those simple words with which our Vietnam veterans greet each other -- Welcome home. Legionnaires, in the decades that followed, the spirit of your service was carried forth by our troops in the sands of Desert Storm and the rugged hills of the Balkans. And now, it's carried on by a new generation. Next weekend, we'll mark the 10th anniversary of those awful attacks on our nation. In the days ahead, we will honor the lives we lost and the families that loved them; the first responders who rushed to save others; and we will honor all those who have served to keep us safe these 10 difficult years, especially the men and women of our Armed Forces. Today, as we near this solemn anniversary, its fitting that we salute the extraordinary decade of service rendered by the 9/11 Generation -- the more than 5 million Americans who've worn the uniform over the past 10 years. They were there, on duty, that September morning, having enlisted in a time of peace, but they instantly transitioned to a war footing. Theyre the millions of recruits who have stepped forward since, seeing their nation at war and saying, Send me. Theyre every single soldier, sailor, airman, Marine and Coast Guardsman serving today, who has volunteered to serve in a time of war, knowing that they could be sent into harms way. They come from every corner of our country, big cities, small towns. They come from every background and every creed. Theyre sons and daughters who carry on the familys tradition of service, and they're new immigrants whove become our newest citizens. Theyre our National Guardsmen and Reservists who've served in unprecedented deployments. Theyre the record number of women in our military, proving themselves in combat like never before. And every day for the past 10 years, these men and women have succeeded together -- as one American team. They're a generation of innovators, and theyve changed the way America fights and wins at wars. Raised in the age of the Internet, theyve harnessed new technologies on the battlefield. Theyve learned the cultures and traditions and languages of the places where they served. Trained to fight, theyve also taken on the role of diplomats and mayors and development experts, negotiating with tribal sheikhs, working with village shuras, partnering with communities. Young captains, sergeants, lieutenants -- they've assumed responsibilities once reserved for more senior commanders, and reminding us that in an era when so many other institutions have shirked their obligations, the men and women of the United States military welcome responsibility. In a decade of war, they've borne an extraordinary burden, with more than 2 million of our service members deploying to the warzones. Hundreds of thousands have deployed again and again, year after year. Never before has our nation asked so much of our all-volunteer force -- that one percent of Americans who wears the uniform. We see the scope of their sacrifice in the tens of thousands who now carry the scars of war, both seen and unseen -- our remarkable wounded warriors. We see it in our extraordinary military families who serve here at home -- the military spouses who hold their families together; the millions of military children, many of whom have lived most of their young lives with our nation at war and mom or dad deployed. Most profoundly, we see the wages of war in those patriots who never came home. They gave their all, their last full measure of devotion, in Kandahar, in the Korengal, in Helmand, in the battles for Baghdad and Fallujah and Ramadi. Now they lay at rest in quiet corners of America, but they live on in the families who loved them and in a nation that is safer because of their service. And today we pay humble tribute to the more than 6,200 Americans in uniform who have given their lives in this hard decade of war. We honor them all. We are grateful for them. Through their service, through their sacrifice, through their astonishing record of achievement, our forces have earned their place among the greatest of generations. Toppling the Taliban in just weeks. Driving al Qaeda from the training camps where they plotted 9/11. Giving the Afghan people the opportunity to live free from terror. When the decision was made to go into Iraq, our troops raced across deserts and removed a dictator in less than a month. When insurgents, militias and terrorists plunged Iraq into chaos, our troops adapted, they endured ferocious urban combat, they reduced the violence and gave Iraqis a chance to forge their own future. When a resurgent Taliban threatened to give al Qaeda more space to plot against us, the additional forces I ordered to Afghanistan went on the offensive -- taking the fight to the Taliban and pushing them out of their safe havens, allowing Afghans to reclaim their communities and training Afghan forces. And a few months ago, our troops achieved our greatest victory yet in the fight against those who attacked us on 9/11 -- delivering justice to Osama bin Laden in one of the greatest intelligence and military operations in American history. Credit for these successes, credit for this progress, belongs to all who have worn the uniform in these wars. Today we're honored to be joined by some of them. And I would ask all those who served this past decade -- the members of the 9/11 Generation -- to stand and accept the thanks of a grateful nation. Thanks to these Americans, were moving forward from a position of strength. Having ended our combat mission in Iraq and removed more than 100,000 troops so far, well remove the rest of our troops by the end of this year and we will end that war. Having put al Qaeda on the path to defeat, we wont relent until the job is done. Having started to draw down our forces in Afghanistan, well bring home 33,000 troops by next summer and bring home more troops in the coming years. As our mission transitions from combat to support, Afghans will take responsibility for their own security, and the longest war in American history will come to a responsible end. For our troops and military families who've sacrificed so much, this means relief from an unrelenting decade of operations. Today, fewer of our sons and daughters are serving in harms way. For so many troops whove already done their duty, weve put an end to the stop loss. And our soldiers can now look forward to shorter deployments. That means more time at home between deployments, and more time training for the full range of missions that they will face. Indeed, despite 10 years of continuous war, it must be said -- Americas military is the best that its ever been. We saw that most recently in the skill and precision of our brave forces who helped the Libyan people finally break free from the grip of Moammar Qaddafi. And as we meet the test that the future will surely bring, including hard fiscal choices here at home, there should be no doubt: The United States of America will keep our military the best-trained, the best-led, the best-equipped fighting force in history. It will continue to be the best. Now, as todays wars end, as our troops come home, were reminded once more of our responsibilities to all who have served. The bond between our forces and our citizens must be a sacred trust. And for me and my administration, upholding that trust is not just a matter of policy, it is not about politics; it is a moral obligation. Thats why my very first budget included the largest percentage increase to the VA budget in the past 30 years. So far, were on track to have increased funding for Veterans Affairs by 30 percent. And because we passed advanced appropriations, when Washington politics threatens to shut down the government, as it did last spring, the veterans' medical care that you count on was safe. And let me say something else about VA funding that you depend on. As a nation, were facing some tough choices as we put our fiscal house in order. But I want to be absolutely clear: We cannot, we must not, we will not, balance the budget on the backs of our veterans. As Commander-in-Chief, I wont allow it. With these historic investments, were making dramatic improvements to veterans' health care. Were improving VA facilities to better serve our women veterans. Were expanding outreach and care for our rural veterans, like those that I met during my recent visit to Cannon Falls, including two proud Legionnaires -- Tom Newman of Legion Post 620 in Hugo, and Joseph Kidd, Post 164 in Stewartville. Are they here right now?", "filename": "30August2011SpeechtotheAmericanLegionConferenceinMinnesota.txt"}, {"question": "Now, obviously, today Madibas health weighs heavily on our hearts.  And like billions all over the world, I -- and the American people -- have drawn strength from the example of this extraordinary leader, and the nation that he changed.  Nelson Mandela showed us that one mans courage can move the world.  And he calls on us to make choices that reflects not our fears, but our hopes -- in our own lives, and in the lives of our communities and our countries.  And thats what I want to speak to all of you about today. Some of you may be aware of this, but I actually took my first step into political life because of South Africa.  This is true.  I was the same age as some of you -- 19 years old, my whole life ahead of me.  I was going to school on a campus in California -- not quite as pretty as this one -- but similar.  And I must confess I was not always focused on my studies.  There were a lot of distractions.  And I enjoyed those distractions. And as the son of an African father and a white American mother, the diversity of America was in my blood, but I had never cared much for politics.  I didnt think it mattered to me.  I didnt think I could make a difference.  And like many young people, I thought that cynicism -- a certain ironic detachment -- was a sign of wisdom and sophistication. But then I learned what was happening here in South Africa.  And two young men, ANC representatives, came to our college and spoke, and I spent time hearing their stories.  And I learned about the courage of those who waged the Defiance Campaign, and the brutality leveled against innocent men, women and children from Sharpeville to Soweto.  And I studied the leadership of Luthuli, and the words of Biko, and the example of Madiba, and I knew that while brave people were imprisoned just off these shores on Robben Island, my own government in the United States was not standing on their side.  Thats why I got involved in what was known as the divestment movement in the United States. It was the first time I ever attached myself to a cause.  It was the first time also that I ever gave a speech.  It was only two minutes long -- and I was really just a warm-up act at a rally that we were holding demanding that our college divest from Apartheid South Africa.  So I got up on stage, I started making my speech, and then, as a bit of political theater, some people came out with glasses that looked like security officers and they dragged me off the stage.  Fortunately, there are no records of this speech.  But I remember struggling to express the anger and the passion that I was feeling, and to echo in some small way the moral clarity of freedom fighters an ocean away. And Ill be honest with you, when I was done, I did not think Id made any difference -- I was even a little embarrassed.  And I thought to myself -- whats a bunch of university kids doing in California that is somehow going to make a difference?  It felt too distant from what people were going through in places like Soweto.  But looking back, as I look at that 19-year old young man, I'm more forgiving of the fact that the speech might not have been that great, because I knew -- I know now that something inside me was stirring at that time, something important.  And that was the belief that I could be part of something bigger than myself; that my own salvation was bound up with those of others. Thats what Bobby Kennedy expressed, far better than I ever could, when he spoke here at the University of Cape Town in 1966.  He said, Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance. Now, the world was very different on that June day in 1966 when Bobby Kennedy spoke those words.  Mandela faced many more years as a prisoner.  Apartheid was entrenched in this land.  In the United States, the victories of the Civil Rights Movement were still uncertain.  In fact, on the very day that Kennedy spoke here, the American civil rights leader, James Meredith, was shot in Mississippi, where he was marching to inspire blacks to register to vote.   Those were difficult, troubled, trying times.  The idea of hope might have seemed misplaced.  It would have seemed inconceivable to people at that time -- that less than 50 years later, an African American President might address an integrated audience, at South Africas oldest university, and that this same university would have conferred an honorary degree to a President, Nelson Mandela.  It would have seemed impossible. Thats the power that comes from acting on our ideals.  Thats what Mandela understood.  But it wasnt just the giants of history who brought about this change.  Think of the many millions of acts of conscience that were part of that effort.  Think about how many voices were raised against injustice over the years -- in this country, in the United States, around the world.  Think of how many times ordinary people pushed against those walls of oppression and resistance, and the violence and the indignities that they suffered; the quiet courage that they sustained.  Think of how many ripples of hope it took to build a wave that would eventually come crashing down like a mighty stream. So Mandelas life, like Kennedys life, like Gandhi's life, like the life of all those who fought to bring about a new South Africa or a more just America -- they stand as a challenge to me.  But more importantly, they stand as a challenge to your generation, because they tell you that your voice matters -- your ideals, your willingness to act on those ideals, your choices can make a difference.  And if theres any country in the world that shows the power of human beings to affect change, this is the one.  Youve shown us how a prisoner can become a President.  You've shown us how bitter adversaries can reconcile.  You've confronted crimes of hatred and intolerance with truth and love, and you wrote into your constitution the human rights that sustain freedom. And those are only the most publicized aspects of South Africas transformation, because alongside South Africas political struggle, other battles have been waged as well to improve the lives of those who for far too long have been denied economic opportunity and social justice.  During my last journey here in 2006, what impressed me so much was the good works of people on the ground teaching children, caring for the sick, bringing jobs to those in need.  In Khayelitsha Township -- I'm still working on some of these -- I met women who were living with HIV.  And this is at a time back in 2006, where there were still some challenges in terms of the policies around HIV and AIDS here in South Africa.  But they were on the ground, struggling to keep their families together -- helping each other, working on behalf of each other.  In Soweto, I met people who were striving to carry forward the legacy of Hector Pieterson.  At the Rosa Parks Library in Pretoria, I was struck by the energy of students who -- they wanted to capture this moment of promise for South Africa. And this is a moment of great promise.  South Africa is one of the worlds economic centers.  Obviously, you can see it here in Cape Town.  In the country that saw the first human heart transplant, new breakthroughs are being made in the treatment of HIV/AIDS.  I was just talking to your Vice Chancellor.  People come to this University from over 100 countries to study and teach.  In America, we see the reach of your culture from Freshly Ground concerts to the -- we've got the Nandos just a couple of blocks from the White House.  And thanks to the first World Cup ever held on this continent, the world now knows the sound of the vuvuzela.  I'm not sure that's like the greatest gift that South Africa ever gave. But progress has also rippled across the African continent.  From Senegal to Cote DIvoire to Malawi, democracy has weathered strong challenges.  Many of the fastest-growing economies in the world are here in Africa, where there is an historic shift taking place from poverty to a growing, nascent middle class.  Fewer people are dying of preventable disease.  More people have access to health care.  More farmers are getting their products to market at fair prices.  From micro-finance projects in Kampala, to stock traders in Lagos, to cell phone entrepreneurs in Nairobi, there is an energy here that can't be denied -- Africa rising.  We know this progress, though, rests on a fragile foundation.  We know that progress is uneven.  Across Africa, the same institutions that should be the backbone of democracy can all too often be infected with the rot of corruption.  The same technology that enables record profits sometimes means widening a canyon of inequality.  The same interconnection that binds our fates makes all of Africa vulnerable to the undertow of conflict. So there is no question that Africa is on the move, but it's not moving fast enough for the child still languishing in poverty in forgotten townships.  It's not moving fast enough for the protester who is beaten in Harare, or the woman who is raped in Eastern Congo.  We've got more work to do, because these Africans must not be left behind. And thats where you come in - the young people of Africa.  Just like previous generations, you've got choices to make.  You get to decide where the future lies.  Think about it -- over 60 percent of Africans are under 35 years old.  So demographics means young people are going to be determining the fate of this continent and this country.  Youve got time and numbers on your side, and youll be making decisions long after politicians like me have left the scene. And I can promise you this:  The world will be watching what decisions you make.  The world will be watching what you do.  Because one of the wonderful things thats happening is, where people used to only see suffering and conflict in Africa, suddenly, now they're seeing opportunity for resources, for investment, for partnership, for influence.  Governments and businesses from around the world are sizing up the continent, and they're making decisions themselves about where to invest their own time and their own energy.  And as I said yesterday at a town hall meeting up in Johannesburg, thats a good thing.  We want all countries -- China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Europe, America -- we want everybody paying attention to what's going on here, because it speaks to your progress. And I've traveled to Africa on this trip because my bet is on the young people who are the heartbeat of Africas story.  I'm betting on all of you.  As President of the United States, I believe that my own nation will benefit enormously if you reach your full potential.  If prosperity is broadly shared here in Africa, that middle class will be an enormous market for our goods.  If strong democracies take root, that will enable our people and businesses to draw closer to yours.  If peace prevails over war, we will all be more secure.  And if the dignity of the individual is upheld across Africa, then I believe Americans will be more free as well, because I believe that none of us are fully free when others in the human family remain shackled by poverty or disease or oppression. Now, America has been involved in Africa for decades.  But we are moving beyond the simple provision of assistance, foreign aid, to a new model of partnership between America and Africa - a partnership of equals that focuses on your capacity to solve problems, and your capacity to grow.  Our efforts focus on three areas that shape our lives:  opportunity, democracy, and peace. So first off, we want a partnership that empowers Africans to access greater opportunity in their own lives, in their communities, and for their countries. As the largest economy on the continent, South Africa is part of a trend that extends from south to north, east to west -- more and more African economies are poised to take off.  And increased trade and investment from the United States has the potential to accelerate these trends - creating new jobs and opportunities on both sides of the Atlantic. So Im calling for America to up our game when it comes to Africa.  Were bringing together business leaders from America and Africa to deepen our engagement.  Were going to launch new trade missions, and promote investment from companies back home.  Well launch an effort in Addis to renew the African Growth and Opportunity Act to break down barriers to trade, and tomorrow Ill discuss a new Trade Africa initiative to expand our ties across the continent, because we want to unleash the power of entrepreneurship and markets to create opportunity here i Africa. It was interesting -- yesterday at the town hall meeting I had with a number of young people, the first three questions had to do with trade, because there was a recognition -- these young people said, I want to start a -- I want to start something.  I want to build something, and then I want to sell something.  Now, to succeed, these efforts have to connect to something bigger.  And for America, this isnt just about numbers on a balance sheet or the resources that can be taken out of the ground.  We believe that societies and economies only advance as far as individuals are free to carry them forward.  And just as freedom cannot exist when people are imprisoned for their political views, true opportunity cannot exist when people are imprisoned by sickness, or hunger, or darkness. And so, the question we've been asking ourselves is what will it take to empower individual Africans? For one thing, we believe that countries have to have the power to feed themselves, so instead of shipping food to Africa, were now helping millions of small farmers in Africa make use of new technologies and farm more land.  And through a new alliance of governments and the private sector, were investing billions of dollars in agriculture that grows more crops, brings more food to market, give farmers better prices and helps lift 50 million people out of poverty in a decade.  An end to famine, a thriving African agricultural industry - thats what opportunity looks like.  Thats what we want to build with you. We believe that countries have to have the power to prevent illness and care for the sick.  And our efforts to combat malaria and tropical illness can lead to an achievable goal:  ending child and maternal deaths from preventable disease.  Already, our commitment to fight HIV/AIDS has saved millions, and allows us to imagine what was once unthinkable:  an AIDS-free generation.  And while America will continue to provide billions of dollars in support, we cant make progress without African partners.  So Im proud that by the end of my presidency, South Africa has determined it will be the first African country to fully manage its HIV care and treatment program.  Thats an enormous achievement.  Healthy mothers and healthy children; strong public health systems -- thats what opportunity looks like. And we believe that nations must have the power to connect their people to the promise of the 21st century.  Access to electricity is fundamental to opportunity in this age.  Its the light that children study by; the energy that allows an idea to be transformed into a real business.  Its the lifeline for families to meet their most basic needs.  And its the connection thats needed to plug Africa into the grid of the global economy.  Youve got to have power.  And yet two-thirds of the population in sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to power -- and the percentage is much higher for those who dont live in cities. So today, I am proud to announce a new initiative.  Weve been dealing with agriculture, weve been dealing with health.  Now were going to talk about power -- Power Africa -- a new initiative that will double access to power in sub-Saharan Africa.  Double it.  Were going to start by investing $7 billion in U.S. government resources.  Were going to partner with the private sector, who themselves have committed more than $9 billion in investment.  And in partnership with African nations, were going to develop new sources of energy.  Well reach more households not just in cities, but in villages and on farms.  Well expand access for those who live currently off the power grid.  And well support clean energy to protect our planet and combat climate change.  So, a light where currently there is darkness; the energy needed to lift people out of poverty -- thats what opportunity looks like. So this is Americas vision:  a partnership with Africa that unleashes growth, and the potential of every citizen, not just a few at the very top.  And this is achievable.  Theres nothing that Ive outlined that cannot happen.  But history tells us that true progress is only possible where governments exist to serve their people, and not the other way around. If anyone wants to see the difference between freedom and tyranny, let them come here, to South Africa.  Here, citizens braved bullets and beatings to claim that most basic right:  the ability to be free, to determine your own fate, in your own land.  And Madibas example extended far beyond that victory.  Now, I mentioned yesterday at the town hall -- like Americas first President, George Washington, he understood that democracy can only endure when its bigger than just one person.  So his willingness to leave power was as profound as his ability to claim power. The good news is that this example is getting attention across the continent.  We see it in free and fair elections from Ghana to Zambia.  We hear it in the voices of civil society.  I was in Senegal and met with some civil society groups, including a group called Yen Marre, which meant fed up -- that helped to defend the will of the people after elections in Senegal.  We recognize it in places like Tanzania, where text messages connect citizens to their representatives.  And we strengthen it when organizations stand up for democratic principles, like ECOWAS did in Cote dIvoire. But this work is not complete -- we all know that.  Not in those countries where leaders enrich themselves with impunity; not in communities where you cant start a business, or go to school, or get a house without paying a bribe to somebody.  These things have to change.  And they have to chance not just because such corruption is immoral, but its also a matter of self-interest and economics.  Governments that respect the rights of their citizens and abide by the rule of law do better, grow faster, draw more investment than those who dont.  Thats just a fact. Just look at your neighbor, Zimbabwe, where the promise of liberation gave way to the corruption of power and then the collapse of the economy.  Now, after the leaders of this region -- led by South Africa -- brokered an end to what has been a long-running crisis, Zimbabweans have a new constitution, the economy is beginning to recover.  So there is an opportunity to move forward -- but only if there is an election that is free, and fair, and peaceful, so that Zimbabweans can determine their future without fear of intimidation and retribution.  And after elections, there must be respect for the universal rights upon which democracy depends. These are things that America stands for -- not perfectly -- but thats what we stand for, and thats what my administration stands for.  We dont tell people who their leaders should be, but we do stand up with those who support the principles that lead to a better life.  And thats why were interested in investing not in strongmen, but in strong institutions:  independent judiciaries that can enforce the rule of law; honest police forces that can protect the peoples interests instead of their own; an open government that can bring transparency and accountability.  And, yes, thats why we stand up for civil society -- for journalists and NGOs, and community organizers and activists -- who give people a voice.  And thats why we support societies that empower women -- because no country will reach its potential unless it draws on the talents of our wives and our mothers, and our sisters and our daughters. Just to editorialize here for a second, because my father's home country of Kenya -- like much of Africa -- you see women doing work and not getting respect.  I tell you, you can measure how well a country does by how it treats its women.  And all across this continent, and all around the world, we've got more work to do on that front.  We've got some sisters saying, \"Amen.\" Now, I know that there are some in Africa who hear me say these things -- who see America's support for these values -- and say that's intrusive.  Why are you meddling?", "filename": "30June2013CapeTownUniversitySpeech.txt"}, {"question": "We've got a number of acknowledgements.  First of all, I just want to thank President DeGioia for his outstanding leadership here, but also for his hospitality. We also have here Secretary Steven Chu, my Energy Secretary. Where is Steven?  There he is over there. Secretary Ken Salazar of the Interior Department.  Secretary Tom Vilsack, our Agriculture Secretary. Ray LaHood, our Transportation Secretary.   Lisa Jackson, our EPA Administrator. Nancy Sutley, who is our Council on Environmental Quality director, right here. A couple of great members of Congress -- Congressman Jay Inslee of Washington.  Wheres Jay?", "filename": "30March2011SpeechonAmericanEnergySecurityatGeorgetownUniv..txt"}, {"question": "Yesterday the United States presented a powerful case that the Syrian government was responsible for this attack on its own people. Our intelligence shows the Assad regime and its forces preparing to use chemical weapons, launching rockets in the highly populated suburbs of Damascus, and acknowledging that a chemical weapons attack took place. And all of this corroborates what the world can plainly see -- hospitals overflowing with victims; terrible images of the dead. All told, well over 1,000 people were murdered. Several hundred of them were children -- young girls and boys gassed to death by their own government. This attack is an assault on human dignity. It also presents a serious danger to our national security. It risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. It endangers our friends and our partners along Syria's borders, including Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq. It could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons, or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm. In a world with many dangers, this menace must be confronted. Now, after careful deliberation, I have decided that the United States should take military action against Syrian regime targets. This would not be an open-ended intervention. We would not put boots on the ground. Instead, our action would be designed to be limited in duration and scope. But I'm confident we can hold the Assad regime accountable for their use of chemical weapons, deter this kind of behavior, and degrade their capacity to carry it out. Our military has positioned assets in the region. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has informed me that we are prepared to strike whenever we choose. Moreover, the Chairman has indicated to me that our capacity to execute this mission is not time-sensitive; it will be effective tomorrow, or next week, or one month from now. And I'm prepared to give that order. But having made my decision as Commander-in-Chief based on what I am convinced is our national security interests, I'm also mindful that I'm the President of the world's oldest constitutional democracy. I've long believed that our power is rooted not just in our military might, but in our example as a government of the people, by the people, and for the people. And that's why I've made a second decision: I will seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress. Over the last several days, we've heard from members of Congress who want their voices to be heard. I absolutely agree. So this morning, I spoke with all four congressional leaders, and they've agreed to schedule a debate and then a vote as soon as Congress comes back into session. In the coming days, my administration stands ready to provide every member with the information they need to understand what happened in Syria and why it has such profound implications for America's national security. And all of us should be accountable as we move forward, and that can only be accomplished with a vote. I'm confident in the case our government has made without waiting for U.N. inspectors. I'm comfortable going forward without the approval of a United Nations Security Council that, so far, has been completely paralyzed and unwilling to hold Assad accountable. As a consequence, many people have advised against taking this decision to Congress, and undoubtedly, they were impacted by what we saw happen in the United Kingdom this week when the Parliament of our closest ally failed to pass a resolution with a similar goal, even as the Prime Minister supported taking action. Yet, while I believe I have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization, I know that the country will be stronger if we take this course, and our actions will be even more effective. We should have this debate, because the issues are too big for business as usual. And this morning, John Boehner, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell agreed that this is the right thing to do for our democracy. A country faces few decisions as grave as using military force, even when that force is limited. I respect the views of those who call for caution, particularly as our country emerges from a time of war that I was elected in part to end. But if we really do want to turn away from taking appropriate action in the face of such an unspeakable outrage, then we must acknowledge the costs of doing nothing. Here's my question for every member of Congress and every member of the global community: What message will we send if a dictator can gas hundreds of children to death in plain sight and pay no price? What's the purpose of the international system that we've built if a prohibition on the use of chemical weapons that has been agreed to by the governments of 98 percent of the world's people and approved overwhelmingly by the Congress of the United States is not enforced? Make no mistake -- this has implications beyond chemical warfare. If we won't enforce accountability in the face of this heinous act, what does it say about our resolve to stand up to others who flout fundamental international rules? To governments who would choose to build nuclear arms? To terrorist who would spread biological weapons? To armies who carry out genocide?", "filename": "31August2013OnSyrianGovernmentUseofChemicalWeapons.txt"}, {"question": "The first part of this agreement will cut about $1 trillion in spending over the next 10 years -- cuts that both parties had agreed to early on in this process.  The result would be the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was President -- but at a level that still allows us to make job-creating investments in things like education and research.  We also made sure that these cuts wouldnt happen so abruptly that theyd be a drag on a fragile economy.  Now, I've said from the beginning that the ultimate solution to our deficit problem must be balanced.  Despite what some Republicans have argued, I believe that we have to ask the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share by giving up tax breaks and special deductions.  Despite what some in my own party have argued, I believe that we need to make some modest adjustments to programs like Medicare to ensure that theyre still around for future generations.  That's why the second part of this agreement is so important.  It establishes a bipartisan committee of Congress to report back by November with a proposal to further reduce the deficit, which will then be put before the entire Congress for an up or down vote.  In this stage, everything will be on the table. To hold us all accountable for making these reforms, tough cuts that both parties would find objectionable would automatically go into effect if we dont act.  And over the next few months, Ill continue to make a detailed case to these lawmakers about why I believe a balanced approach is necessary to finish the job.  Now, is this the deal I would have preferred?", "filename": "31July2011StatementontheDebtCompromiseAgreement.txt"}]
